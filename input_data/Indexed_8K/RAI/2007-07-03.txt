     On June 28, 2007, Reynolds American Inc. ("RAI") entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Syndication Agent, General Electric Capital Corporation, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., as Documentation Agents, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Co-Documentation Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and CitiGroup Global Markets Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and the various lending institutions party thereto (the "New Credit Agreement"). The New Credit Agreement amends and restates RAI's Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2006 (the "Prior Credit Agreement"). The New Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, $550 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $900 million at the discretion of the lenders upon the request of RAI). The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a five-year, $550 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which could be increased to $800 million at the discretion of the lenders upon the request of RAI) and a six-year, $1.55 billion senior secured term loan. On June 21, 2007, RAI pre-paid in full the $1.54 billion principal amount outstanding under such term loan, plus accrued interest thereon.
     The New Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit RAI's and its subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, make investments, prepay certain indebtedness, incur indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, create liens, acquire, sell or dispose of specific assets and engage in specified mergers or consolidations, which covenants are generally less restrictive than those contained in the Prior Credit Agreement. These covenants in the New Credit Agreement are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. In addition, the cost to RAI of borrowings under the New Credit Agreement is less than that under the Prior Credit Agreement, and the maturity date of the New Credit Agreement is June 28, 2012 (which date may be extended in two separate one year increments) as compared to the maturity date of the revolving credit facility under the Prior Credit Agreement of May 31, 2011 (with no provisions for extension). Other than with respect to restrictive covenants, the amount by which the revolving credit facility may be increased, the cost of borrowings and the maturity date, all as discussed above, the terms and conditions of the New Credit Agreement are similar to those of the Prior Credit Agreement.
     The New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including upon a change in control (as defined therein), that could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding under the New Credit Agreement.
     RAI is able to use the revolving credit facility under the New Credit Agreement for borrowings and issuances of letters of credit at its option. Issuances of letters of credit reduce availability under such revolving credit facility. There currently are no borrowings, and $24 million of letters of credit outstanding, under the New Credit Agreement.
     Under the terms of the New Credit Agreement, RAI is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.25% and 1.0% (based on the facility's credit ratings) per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility thereunder, which reflects a cost savings of up to 0.5% (based on facility credit rating levels) as compared to the revolving credit facility under the Prior Credit Agreement.
     Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement bear interest, at the option of RAI, at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus:
     The initial applicable margin under the New Credit Agreement is 0.25% with respect to reference rate loans and 1.25% with respect to eurodollar loans. These rates are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to the New Credit Agreement. Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest, outstanding under the revolving credit facility under the New Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the rate then in effect with respect to such borrowings, plus 2.0% per annum.
     Certain of RAI's subsidiaries, including its material domestic subsidiaries (all such subsidiaries, the "Guarantors"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent, entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated
 
Subsidiary Guaranty, dated as of June 28, 2007 (the "Subsidiary Guaranty"), pursuant to which the Guarantors guaranteed RAI's obligations under the New Credit Agreement.
     Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2007, among RAI, the Guarantors, as pledgors, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Collateral Agent and Pledgee (the "Pledge Agreement"), and the Third Amended and Restated Security Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2007, among RAI, the Guarantors, as assignors, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Collateral Agent and Assignee (the "Security Agreement"), RAI pledged substantially all of its assets, including the stock of its direct subsidiaries, to secure its obligations under the New Credit Agreement. In addition, pursuant to these agreements, the Guarantors have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure their guarantees of RAI's obligations under the New Credit Agreement (including the stock, indebtedness and other obligations held by or owing to such guarantor of a subsidiary, other than for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiary guarantors, which pledge is limited to the stock of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc.'s direct, wholly owned subsidiary, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company); provided, however, that RAI's direct, wholly owned subsidiaries, Lane, Limited and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc., pledged substantially all of their personal property, but no real property. Pursuant to these agreements, certain assets of RAI and certain of the Guarantors are also pledged to secure the obligations of these entities under outstanding senior secured notes of RAI issued under RAI's indenture dated May 31, 2006.
     Under the terms of the New Credit Agreement, at such time, if any, as RAI has obtained a corporate rating of investment grade (with not worse than stable outlooks) from each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., the security for the New Credit Agreement will, generally, be released automatically and the obligations thereunder will become unsecured.
     Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement, in the event of RAI's exposure under any hedging arrangement with a lender under the New Credit Agreement (or any affiliate of such lender), RAI's obligations with respect to such hedging arrangement will be guaranteed by the same entities and secured by the same assets as under the New Credit Agreement and related documents.
     The various agents under the New Credit Agreement, or their affiliates, are lenders under such agreement. In addition, certain of these agents, or their affiliates, have from time to time performed, and may in the future perform, various investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking and/or other services for RAI for which they have been paid, or will be paid, customary fees.
     The New Credit Agreement, Pledge Agreement, Security Agreement and Subsidiary Guaranty related thereto are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

rata
 
Swingline Loans were made. In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the Borrower), each RL Lender (other than a Swingline Lender with respect to Swingline Loans made by it) hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase from each Swingline Lender (without recourse or warranty) such assignment of its outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause the RL Lenders to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon their respective RL Percentages; that all interest payable on such Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the relevant Swingline Lender until the date the respective assignment is purchased and, to the extent attributable to the purchased assignment, shall be payable to the RL Lender purchasing same from and after such date of purchase.

(New York City time) on such day. Each such notice (each, together with each notice of a Borrowing of Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 1.03(b), a ""), shall be irrevocable and shall be in writing, or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing, appropriately completed to specify: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans to be incurred pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), and (iii) whether the Revolving Loans being incurred pursuant to such Borrowing are to be initially maintained as Reference Rate Loans or, to the extent permitted hereunder, Eurodollar Loans and, if Eurodollar Loans, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto.

          (c) Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in Section 1.01(c), with the Borrower irrevocably agreeing, by its incurrence of any Swingline Loan, to the making of Mandatory Borrowings as set forth in such Section.
          (d) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice, believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower. In each such case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent's record of the terms of any such telephonic notice.
          1.04 . (a) No later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date of each Borrowing (including Mandatory Borrowings), each Lender with a Commitment under the respective Tranche will make available its portion, if any, of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided in Section 1.04(b) below.

pro

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any such Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available same to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (x) if paid by such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Rate or (y) if paid by the Borrower, the then applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with Section 1.08, for the respective Loans.
 
          (c) Nothing in this Section 1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
          1.05 . (a) The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Loans made by each Lender shall be set forth in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.04(f) and, subject to the provisions of Section 1.05(e), shall be evidenced (i) if Revolving Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each, a "" and, collectively, the "") and (ii) if Swingline Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (the "" and, together with the Revolving Notes, each, a "" and, collectively, the "").

on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation or any error in any such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans.
          (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above or elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to Lenders that at any time specifically request the delivery of such Notes. No failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans to the Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the Borrower to pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) which would otherwise be evidenced thereby in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and shall not in any way affect the security or guaranties therefor provided pursuant to the various Credit Documents. Any Lender that does not have a Note evidencing its outstanding Loans shall in no event be required to make the notations otherwise described in preceding clause (d). At any time when any Lender requests the delivery of a Note to evidence any of its Loans, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender the requested Note or Notes in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Loans.

The Borrower shall have the option to convert on any Business Day all or a portion equal to at least the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount of the outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of Revolving Loans of another Type; that (i) no partial conversion of Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount, (ii) Reference Rate Loans may only be converted into Eurodollar Loans if no Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and (iii) Borrowings resulting from conversions pursuant to this Section 1.06 shall be limited in number as provided in Section 1.02. Each such conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) at least three Business Days' (or one Business Day's in the case of a conversion into Reference Rate Loans) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) (each, a "") specifying the Revolving Loans to be so converted, the Type of Revolving Loans to be converted into and, if to be converted into Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto.

All other overdue amounts payable hereunder and under any other Credit Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained as Reference Rate Loans from time to time.

          1.09 . At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion in respect of the making of, or conversion into, a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (in the case of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, it shall have the right to elect by giving the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower, be a one, two, three or six month period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:
Interest Periods
     (i) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any conversion from a Borrowing of Reference Rate Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in
 
respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;
     (ii) if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;
     (iii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day, that if any Interest Period in respect of a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and
provided
     (iv) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall extend beyond the RL Maturity Date for any Lender participating in such Borrowing.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default is in existence at the time any Interest Period in respect of any Eurodollar Loans is to expire, such Eurodollar Loans may not be continued as Eurodollar Loans but instead shall be automatically converted on the last day of such Interest Period into Reference Rate Loans. If upon the expiration of any Interest Period in respect of Eurodollar Loans, the Borrower has failed to elect a new Interest Period to be applicable thereto as provided above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing into a Borrowing of Reference Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.

Increased Costs, Illegality, etc
     (i) on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period that, by reason of any changes arising on or after the Fifth Restatement Effective Date affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or
     (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Eurodollar Loans because of (x) any change since the Fifth Restatement Effective Date in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order) such as, for example, but not limited to, (A) a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Eurodollar Rate or (B) a
 
change in the basis of taxation of payments to a Lender of the principal of or interest on the Loans or any other amount payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or net profits of such Lender imposed by the jurisdiction in which its principal office or applicable lending office is located) and/or (y) other circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar market; or
     (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Loan (other than Reference Rate Loans) has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Fifth Restatement Effective Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank Eurodollar market;
then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall on such date give notice (if by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by the Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans which have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 1.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.
          (b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(iii) shall) either (i) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, cancel said Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof as promptly as practicable after the Borrower was notified by a Lender pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), or (ii) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert each such Eurodollar Loan into a Reference Rate Loan; that if more than one Lender is affected in a similar manner at any time, then all such similarly affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 1.10(b).

          (c) If after the Fifth Restatement Effective Date, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by a Lender or its parent with any request or directive made or adopted after the Fifth Restatement Effective Date regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or its parent's capital or assets as a consequence of such Lender's commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or its parent could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or its parent's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such reduction. Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to Section 1.15, release or diminish any of the Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 1.10(c) upon receipt of such notice.
          1.11 . The Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans but excluding any loss of anticipated profit with respect to such Loans) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion (whether or not withdrawn by the Borrower or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section 1.10); (ii) if any repayment or conversion of any of its Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of (x) any other default by the Borrower to repay its Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (y) an election made pursuant to Section 1.10(b). Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 1.11 in respect of Eurodollar Loans shall be made as though that Lender had actually funded its relevant Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of that Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United States of America; , , that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it sees fit.

No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 12.12(a), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

          7.2 . Upon the occurrence and continuance of a Noticed Event of Default, any Collateral repossessed by the Collateral Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.1 and any other Collateral whether or not so repossessed by the Collateral Agent, may be sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of under one or more contracts or as an entirety, and without the necessity of gathering at the place of sale the property to be sold, and in general in such manner, at such time or times, at such place or places and on such terms as the Collateral Agent may, in compliance with any mandatory requirements of applicable law, determine to be commercially reasonable. Any of the Collateral may be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of, in the condition in which the same existed when taken by the Collateral Agent or after any overhaul or repair which the Collateral Agent shall determine to be commercially reasonable. Any such disposition which shall be a private sale or other private proceedings permitted by such requirements shall be made upon not less than ten (10) days' written notice to the relevant Assignor specifying the time at which such disposition is to be made and the intended sale price or other consideration therefor, and shall be subject, for the ten (10) days after the giving of such notice, to the right of the relevant Assignor or any nominee of such Assignor to acquire the Collateral involved at a price or for such other consideration at least equal to the intended sale price or other consideration so specified. Any such disposition which shall be a public sale permitted by such requirements shall be made upon not less than ten (10) days' written notice to the relevant Assignor specifying the time and place of such sale and, in the absence of applicable requirements of law, shall be by public auction (which may, at the Collateral Agent's option, be subject to reserve), after publication of notice of such auction not less than 10 days prior thereto in one newspaper in general circulation in the City of New York and one newspaper in general circulation in Winston Salem, North Carolina.

If, under mandatory requirements of applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall be required to make disposition of the Collateral within a period of time which does not permit the giving of notice to the relevant Assignor as hereinabove specified, the Collateral Agent need give such Assignor only such notice of disposition as shall be reasonably practicable in view of such mandatory requirements of applicable law.

Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other realization upon, any Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand, either at law or in equity, of the relevant Assignor therein and thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against such Assignor and against any and all Persons claiming or attempting to claim the Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof, from, through and under such Assignor.
          7.4 . (a) All moneys collected by the Collateral Agent upon any sale, other disposition of or other realization upon any Collateral, together with all other moneys received by the Collateral Agent hereunder (collectively, the ""), shall be applied as follows:

          (e) It is understood that each Assignor shall remain liable to the extent of any deficiency between (x) the amount of the obligations for which it is liable directly or as a Guarantor that are satisfied with proceeds of the Collateral and (y) the aggregate outstanding amount of such Obligations.

No delay or omission of the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any such right, power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any of the Obligations shall impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. In the event that the Collateral Agent shall bring any suit to enforce any of its rights hereunder and shall be entitled to judgment, then in such suit the Collateral Agent may recover expenses, including attorneys' fees, and the amounts thereof shall be included in such judgment.

               (iv) settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party to creditors of the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party;
               (v) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party to the Creditors regardless of what liabilities of the Borrower or such other Guaranteed Party remain unpaid;

               (vii) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, the Secured Credit Card Agreements, the Permitted Hedging Agreements, the Credit Documents or any of the instruments or agreements referred to therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Secured Credit Card Agreements, the Permitted Hedging Agreements, the Credit Documents or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or
               (viii) act or fail to act in any manner referred to in this Guaranty which may deprive such Guarantor of its right to subrogation against the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party to recover full indemnity for any payments made pursuant to this Guaranty.
          7. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor shall affect, impair or be a defense to this Guaranty, and this Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor except payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.
          8. This Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. No failure or delay on the part of any Creditor in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Creditor would
 
otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Creditor to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. It is not necessary for any Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its or their behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
          9. Any indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the indebtedness of the Borrower or such other Guaranteed Party, as the case may be, to the Creditors; and such indebtedness of the Borrower or such other Guaranteed Party to any Guarantor, if the Administrative Agent, after an Event of Default has occurred, so requests, shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Creditors and be paid over to the Creditors on account of the indebtedness of the Borrower or such other Guaranteed Party to the Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by any Guarantor of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party to such Guarantor, such Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.
          10. (a) Each Guarantor waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the Creditors to: (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of any Guaranteed Party or any other person; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of any Guaranteed Party or any other person; or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the Creditors' power whatsoever. Each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of any Guaranteed Party or any other person other than payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of any Guaranteed Party or any other person, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party, other than payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the other Creditors by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Creditors may have against the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party or any other person, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Each Guarantor waives any defense
 
arising out of any such election by the Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party or any other person or any security.
          (b) Each Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's and each other Guaranteed Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Creditors shall have no duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.
          (c) Until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash, each Guarantor hereby forbears from exercising all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from the Borrower, any other Guaranteed Party or any other Guarantor which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty.
          11. If and to the extent that any Guarantor makes any payment to any Creditor or to any other Person pursuant to or in respect of this Guaranty, any claim which such Guarantor may have against the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party by reason thereof shall be subject and subordinate to the prior payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations to each Creditor.
          12. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that on and after the date hereof and until the termination of the Total Commitment and when no Note or Letter of Credit remains outstanding and all Credit Document Obligations have been paid in full (other than those arising from indemnities for which no request has been made), such Guarantor shall take, or will refrain from taking, as the case may be, all actions that are necessary to be taken or not taken so that no violation of any provision, covenant or agreement contained in Section 7 or 8 of the Credit Agreement, and so that no Event of Default, is caused by the actions of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.
          13. The Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree to pay all reasonable and actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each Creditor in connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty and the protection of such Creditor's rights hereunder, and in connection with any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto (including, without limitation, the reasonable and actual fees and disbursements of counsel employed by the Administrative Agent or any of the other Creditors). Any reference in this Guaranty to "fees of counsel" shall mean the actual and reasonable fees of counsel incurred at customary and reasonable rates in the jurisdiction in which such counsel performed its services, not pursuant to any statutory formula or percentage calculation.
          14. This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Creditors and their successors and assigns.
 
          15. Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated in any manner whatsoever unless in writing duly signed by the Administrative Agent (with the consent of (x) the Required Lenders or, to the extent required by Section 12.12 of the Credit Agreement, all of the Lenders, at all times prior to the time at which all Credit Document Obligations have been paid in full, or (y) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Credit Card Obligations and Hedging Obligations at all times after the time at which all Credit Document Obligations have been paid in full) and each Guarantor directly affected thereby (it being understood that the addition or release of any Guarantor hereunder shall not constitute a change, waiver, discharge or termination affecting any Guarantor other than the Guarantor so added or released); , that any change, waiver, modification or variance affecting the rights and benefits of a single Class (as defined below) of Creditors (and not all Creditors in a like or similar manner) shall require the written consent of the Requisite Creditors (as defined below) of such Class. For the purpose of this Guaranty, the term "" shall mean each class of Creditors, , whether (i) the Lender Creditors as holders of the Credit Document Obligations, (ii) the Credit Card Issuers as holders of the Credit Card Obligations or (iii) the Hedging Creditors as holders of the Hedging Obligations. For the purpose of this Guaranty, the term "" of any Class shall mean each of (i) with respect to the Credit Document Obligations, the Required Lenders, (ii) with respect to the Credit Card Obligations, the holders of at least a majority of all Credit Card Obligations outstanding from time to time and (iii) with respect to the Hedging Obligations, the holders of at least a majority of all obligations outstanding from time to time under the Permitted Hedging Agreements.

Each Guarantor acknowledges that an executed (or conformed) copy of each of the Credit Documents, the Secured Credit Card Agreements and the Permitted Hedging Agreements has been made available to its principal executive officers and such officers are familiar with the contents thereof.
          17. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 151 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law) and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (such term to mean and include any "Event of Default" as defined in the Credit Agreement and any payment default under any Secured Credit Card Agreement or Permitted Hedging Agreement and to include in any event, any payment default on any of the Guaranteed Obligations continuing after any applicable grace period), each Creditor is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Creditor to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Guarantor to such Creditor under this Guaranty, irrespective of whether or not such Creditor shall have made any demand hereunder and although said obligations, liabilities, deposits or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. Each Creditor acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 17 are subject to the sharing provisions set forth in Section 12.06(b) of the Credit Agreement.
          18. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telegraphic, telex, facsimile transmission or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered (including by way of overnight
 
courier) (i) in the case of any Lender Creditor, as provided in the Credit Agreement, (ii) in the case of any Guarantor, at its address set forth opposite its signature below, (iii) in the case of any Credit Card Issuer, at such address as such Credit Card Issuer shall have specified in writing to the Guarantors and (iv) in the case of any Hedging Creditor, at such address as such Hedging Creditor shall have specified in writing to the Guarantors; or, in any case, at such other address as shall be designated by any party in a written notice to the other parties hereto. All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given or made (i) in the case of any Creditor, when received and (ii) in the case of any Guarantor, when delivered to such Guarantor in any manner required or permitted hereunder.
          19. If claim is ever made upon any Creditor for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of said Creditors repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Creditor or any of its property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such Creditor with any such claimant (including the Borrower and each other Guaranteed Party), then and in such event each Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon such Guarantor, notwithstanding any revocation hereof or the cancellation of any Note, any Secured Credit Card Agreement or any Permitted Hedging Agreement or other instrument evidencing any liability of the Borrower or any other Guaranteed Party, and such Guarantor shall be and remain liable to such Creditor hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such Creditor.
          20. (a) This Guaranty and the rights and obligations of the Creditors and of the undersigned hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the state of New York.
          (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to which any Guarantor is a party may be brought in the courts of the state of New York or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each Guarantor further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Guarantor at its address set forth opposite its signature below, such service to become effective 30 days after such mailing. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process and further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any action or proceeding commenced hereunder or under any other credit document to which such Guarantor is a party that service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Borrower as its agent for service of process in respect of any such action or proceeding. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any of the Creditors to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.
 
          (c) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty or any other Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in clause (b) above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
          (d) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives all rights to a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, the other Credit Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
          21. In the event that all of the capital stock or other equity interests of one or more Guarantors is sold or otherwise disposed of (to a Person other than the Borrower or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary thereof) or liquidated in compliance with the requirements of Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement (or such sale, disposition or liquidation has been approved in writing by the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, if required by Section 12.12 of the Credit Agreement)), such Guarantor shall be released from this Guaranty and this Guaranty shall, as to each such Guarantor or Guarantors, terminate, and have no further force or effect (it being understood and agreed that the sale of one or more Persons that own, directly or indirectly, all of the capital stock or other equity interests of any Guarantor shall be deemed to be a sale of such Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 21).
          22. All payments made by any Guarantor hereunder will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense.
          23. This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
          24. It is understood and agreed that any Subsidiary of the Borrower that is required to execute a counterpart of this Guaranty pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall automatically become a Guarantor hereunder by executing a counterpart hereof (or an assumption agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) and delivering the same to the Administrative Agent.
          25. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Guaranty, the Creditors agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or, after the date on which all Credit Document Obligations have been paid in full, the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Credit Card Obligations and Hedging Obligations), and that no other Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Credit Card Obligations and Hedging Obligations, as the case may be, for the benefit of the Creditors upon the terms of this Guaranty. The Creditors further agree that this Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee, or stockholder of
 
any Guarantor (except to the extent such stockholder is also a Guarantor hereunder). It is understood that the agreement in this Section 25 is among and solely for the benefit of the Lenders and that if the Required Lenders so agree (without requiring the consent of any Guarantor), this Guaranty may be directly enforced by any Creditor.
          26. Each Guarantor hereby confirms that it is its intention that this Guaranty not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any similar Federal, state of foreign law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, result in the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
          27. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that this Guaranty amends and restates (and supersedes in its entirety) the Fifth Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
