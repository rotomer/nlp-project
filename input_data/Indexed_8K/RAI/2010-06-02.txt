The Contract Manufacturing Agreement, dated July 30, 2004, as amended, between the parties, referred to as the 2004 Agreement, has been terminated as described below under Item 1.02. A copy of the 2010 Agreement is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.
ITEM 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On May 26, 2010, RJRTC and BATUS Japan entered into a letter agreement terminating the 2004 Agreement, with effect from midnight on December 31, 2009. Under the 2004 Agreement, RJRTC was appointed BATUS Japan's exclusive manufacturer of all of BATUS Japan's requirements for certain American-blend cigarettes intended to be distributed and sold in Japan. The 2004 Agreement was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2014, subject to the early termination and extension provisions set forth in the agreement. Under the terms of the letter agreement, certain sections and sub-sections of the 2004 Agreement will survive the termination, and, in consideration of RJRTC agreeing to terminate such agreement and in settlement of all disputes at issue between the parties associated with such agreement, BATUS Japan has agreed to pay RJRTC the sum of US$20,528,000.

     On May 28, 2010, RAI announced a consolidation and upgrading of manufacturing facilities at multiple operating companies. A cigarette factory in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and one in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico will close, and production from those facilities will transfer to RJRTC's facility in Tobaccoville, North Carolina. As a result of the consolidation, approximately 60 manufacturing positions in Puerto Rico will be eliminated, and affected employees will receive severance benefits.
     American Snuff Company, LLC is expanding its manufacturing operations in Memphis, Tennessee, expecting the new facilities to be fully operational in early 2012, and increasing its tobacco-processing capacity in Clarksville, Tennessee, expecting the new facilities to be fully operational in early 2012.
     These events will maximize cigarette-manufacturing efficiency and expand smokeless tobacco production capacity, while complying with new regulatory requirements. No material charges are expected to be incurred by the operating companies in connection with the disposal of the facilities.

Exhibit 99.1
Reynolds American Inc. P.O. Box 2990 Winston-Salem, NC 27102-2990
 To maximize cigarette-manufacturing efficiency and expand smokeless tobacco production capacity, several operating companies of Reynolds American Inc. (NYSE: RAI) are making changes to their manufacturing facilities.
Winston-Salem, N.C.  May 28, 2010
A cigarette factory in Winston-Salem, N.C., and one in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, will close, and production from those two older plants will transfer to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's largest facility in Tobaccoville, N.C.
Meanwhile, American Snuff Company, LLC is expanding its smokeless tobacco processing and manufacturing capacity by investing in facilities in Memphis and Clarksville, Tenn.
"Our operating companies are optimizing their manufacturing networks to increase efficiency, upgrade and expand some operations, and reduce complexity," said Susan Ivey, RAI's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "These changes make our companies more efficient in light of the declining U.S. cigarette industry and growth in smokeless tobacco. Consolidating production into fewer and newer facilities will also facilitate cost-effective compliance with new federal regulation of the tobacco industry."
Cigarette manufacturing volume and employees will begin moving from R.J. Reynolds' Whitaker Park plant to Tobaccoville this summer. Whitaker Park will cease manufacturing in mid-2011.
Cigarette production at an R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company affiliate in Yabucoa will be transferred to Tobaccoville by the end of August 2010. About 60 manufacturing employees' jobs in Yabucoa will be eliminated, and those employees will receive severance benefits. The company's distribution operations in Puerto Rico are not affected by the plant closure.
In Memphis, American Snuff Co. is expanding its manufacturing operations using property and a facility purchased last year. Construction began in April, and the new facility will be fully operational in January 2012. The company's current plant, built in 1904, will close in 2012.
American Snuff Co. is also doing construction in Clarksville, Tenn., to increase its tobacco-processing capacity. New tobacco receiving and processing operations and dry snuff manufacturing will begin in phases, and the facilities will be fully operational by early 2012.
"The decision to close a plant is never easy," said Ivey. "These changes to our companies' operations footprint address last year's significant increase in the federal tax on cigarettes and new regulatory requirements. We must ensure that our companies are keenly focused on productivity and efficiency in order to continue to compete successfully in the years ahead."
