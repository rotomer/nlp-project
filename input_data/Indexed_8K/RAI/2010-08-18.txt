Exhibit 99.1
Reynolds American Inc. P.O. Box 2990 Winston-Salem, NC 27102-2990
 Reynolds American Inc. (NYSE: RAI) announced that Nicandro Durante, the chief operating officer of British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BAT), has resigned as a member of RAI's board of directors, effective Dec. 1. John Daly, BAT's regional director for Asia-Pacific, has been nominated to RAI's board to succeed Durante, effective Dec. 1.
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.  Aug. 18, 2010
The changes stem from a planned executive realignment at BAT, which was announced earlier this year.
Durante has been a member of RAI's board since December 2008, as one of the five board members designated by Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc. (B&W), a subsidiary of BAT, under the terms of the 2004 governance agreement between RAI, B&W and BAT. Durante's three-year term as a Class II director was due to expire in 2012. Durante is scheduled to become BAT's chief executive designate on Sept. 1, 2010, and will become the company's chief executive at the end of February 2011.
Susan M. Ivey, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Reynolds American, thanked Durante for his contributions to the company and its shareholders. "Nicandro has provided outstanding advice and counsel during his years of service on the board," Ivey said.
Daly, who joined the management board of BAT as regional director for Asia-Pacific in October 2004, will succeed Durante as chief operating officer of BAT on Sept. 1. RAI's board will vote on Daly's formal nomination at its regularly scheduled Dec. 1 meeting.
Daly joined BAT after the 1999 merger of Rothmans International and BAT. Born in 1956 in Dublin, Ireland, Daly, 53, worked in the pharmaceutical industry in the United Kingdom and Ireland before joining the tobacco industry.
