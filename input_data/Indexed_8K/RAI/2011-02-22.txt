Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     At a meeting held on February 16, 2011, the independent members of the Board of Directors, referred to as the Board, of Reynolds American Inc., referred to as RAI, based upon a recommendation from the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board, referred to as the Compensation Committee, approved (1) the performance period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 for the 2011 annual incentive awards to be made under the Reynolds American Inc. 2009 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, referred to as the Omnibus Plan, for certain executive officers, and (2) the performance formula for determining the award pool for the annual incentive awards under the Omnibus Plan for such one-year performance period for each of these executive officers. Under the formula, the award pool for the annual incentive awards for each of the following executive officers will be determined based on the following percentages of RAI's cash net income for the performance period: Susan M. Ivey, 0.20%; Daniel M. Delen, 0.40%; Thomas R. Adams, 0.20%; and Jeffery S. Gentry, 0.20%. E. Julia Lambeth, the other named executive officer listed in RAI's 2010 definitive proxy statement, left RAI at the end of 2010. For purposes of determining such award pools, cash net income is defined as net income from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income adjusted for the impact of non-cash items, such as depreciation, amortization, unrealized gains and losses, intangible asset impairments and other non-cash gains/losses included in net income, as reported in RAI's 2011 audited financial statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011.
     On February 16, 2011, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved the following target award values, expressed as a percentage of each executive officer's base salary as of April 1, 2011 (except in the case of Ms. Ivey, whose target award value was based on her base salary as of January 1, 2011), for the 2011 annual incentive awards under the Omnibus Plan for the following executive officers: Ms. Ivey, 135%; Mr. Delen, 135%; and Mr. Adams, 100%. On February 15, 2011, the Compensation Committee approved a target award value of 75% for Dr. Gentry's 2011 annual incentive award under the Omnibus Plan. As indicated above, Ms. Lambeth left RAI at the end of 2010. The maximum amount of the 2011 annual incentive award for each of the listed executive officers is limited to the percentage of RAI's cash net income approved as the annual incentive award pool for such executive officer by the non-employee directors of the Board, as described above, and the shareholder approved award limitations set forth in the Omnibus Plan. The Compensation Committee may reduce the amount of the 2011 annual incentive award for each of the listed executive officers under such formula using negative discretion after consideration of the 2011 performance of RAI and its operating companies. Generally, such awards are eligible to vest on December 31, 2011, and the payment of awards will be made in cash on or prior to March 15 of the next year. In addition, the annual incentive awards may be paid out partially or fully upon certain other events, such as the listed executive officer's death, disability, retirement, involuntary termination of employment without cause or a change of control of RAI.
th
     On February 16, 2011, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved (1) the three-year performance period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 for the 2011 performance share awards granted under the Omnibus Plan for certain executive officers, and (2) the performance formula for determining the award pool of performance shares under the Omnibus Plan for such three-year performance period for each of these executive officers. Under the formula, the award pool of performance shares for each of the following executive officers will be determined based on the following percentages of RAI's cumulative cash net income for the three-year performance period: Mr. Delen, 0.80%; Mr. Adams, 0.40%; and Dr. Gentry, 0.40%. As previously announced, Ms. Ivey is retiring from RAI on February 28, 2011, and therefore is not eligible for a 2011 performance share award. Also, as indicated above, Ms. Lambeth left RAI at the end of 2010. For purposes of determining such award pools, cash net income is defined as set forth above, except as reported in RAI's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 fiscal years, respectively. The maximum amount of performance shares that any of the listed executive
 
officers may receive at the end of the three-year performance period for the 2011 performance share grant is limited to the award pool for the performance shares determined by the formula based on RAI's cash net income approved for such executive officer by the non-employee directors of the Board, as described above, and the shareholder approved award limitations set forth in the Omnibus Plan. The Compensation Committee may reduce the amount of the 2011 award for each of the listed officers under such formula using negative discretion after consideration of the performance of RAI and its operating companies.
     On February 16, 2011, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved long-term incentive grants under the Omnibus Plan, to be effective on March 1, 2011, to Messrs. Delen and Adams for the January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 performance period. On February 15, 2011, the Compensation Committee approved a long-term incentive grant under the Omnibus Plan, also to be effective on March 1, 2011, to Dr. Gentry. For the reasons stated above, Mmes. Ivey and Lambeth did not receive 2011 long-term incentive grants. The 2011 long-term incentive grants under the Omnibus Plan to such executive officers will be entirely in the form of performance shares. The number of performance shares such executive officers actually will receive, if any, will be determined at the end of the three-year performance period based first on the maximum payout limitation provided by the performance share award pools generated under the pre-established cash net income formula described above. Then the Compensation Committee may use negative discretion to reduce the number of performance shares actually earned by such executive officers to an amount consistent with the average of RAI's scores under the annual incentive award program for each of the three years of the performance period, but no higher than 150% of target. In addition, if RAI fails to pay cumulative dividends of at least $6.36 per share (an amount equal to the $0.53 per share quarterly dividend declared by RAI's Board of Directors at its February 16, 2011 meeting times 12 quarterly dividends) for the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2013, then the number of performance shares earned will be reduced by an amount equal to three times the percentage of the dividend underpayment for the three-year performance period, up to a maximum performance share reduction of 50%.
     Subject to the foregoing, the performance shares generally will vest on March 1, 2014, and will be paid in the form of shares of RAI common stock on or prior to March 15, 2015. At the time the performance shares vest, each of the listed executive officers will receive a single cash dividend equivalent payment equal to the aggregate amount of the dividends per share declared and paid to RAI shareholders on RAI common stock during the period from the beginning of the three-year performance period through the payment of the performance shares, multiplied by the number of performance shares actually earned by such executive officer after the performance adjustments. In addition, the performance shares may be paid out partially or fully upon certain other events, such as the listed executive officer's death, disability, retirement, involuntary termination of employment without cause or a change of control of RAI.
     Although the target value of the performance shares Messrs. Delen and Adams and Dr. Gentry will receive on March 1, 2011 is known as of the date of this report, the actual number of performance shares each of them will be granted on March 1, 2011 will not be determinable until such date. For each of these executive officers, the number of performance shares granted will be equal to the target long-term incentive opportunity (expressed as a multiple of base salary as of March 1, 2011) for such executive officer set forth below, divided by the average closing price of a share of RAI common stock for the 20 trading days prior to the March 1, 2011 grant date: Mr. Delen, 6X; Mr. Adams, 2.5X; and Dr. Gentry, 2X. The grant date fair value of the performance shares granted to each such executive officer will equal the product of the per share closing price of RAI common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of performance shares granted to each executive officer.
