On July 29, 2011, Reynolds American Inc. ("") entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Syndication Agent, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as Documentation Agents, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Co-Documentation Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, CitiGroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and The Bank of Nova Scotia as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and various other lending institutions party thereto (the ""). The New Credit Agreement replaces RAI's Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2007, as amended (the ""). The New Credit Agreement provides for a four-year, $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $1 billion at the discretion of the lenders upon the request of RAI).
RAI
New Credit Agreement
Prior Credit Agreement
The New Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that (a) limit the ability of RAI and its subsidiaries to (i) pay dividends and repurchase stock, (ii) engage in transactions with affiliates, (iii) create liens, and (iv) engage in sale-leaseback transactions involving a Principal Property, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, and (b) limit the ability of RAI and its Material Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in the New Credit Agreement) to sell or dispose of all or substantially all of their assets and engage in specified mergers or consolidations, which covenants are generally less restrictive than those contained in the Prior Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement also contains a restrictive covenant that limits the amount of debt that may be incurred by non-guarantor subsidiaries, together with certain financial covenants. The restrictive covenants in the New Credit Agreement are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. The financial covenant levels in the New Credit Agreement are 3.00 to 1.00 for the consolidated leverage ratio covenant and 4.00 to 1.00 for the consolidated interest coverage ratio, versus the 3.25 to 1.00 consolidated total leverage and 3.00 to 1.00 consolidated interest coverage covenant levels in the Prior Credit Agreement. In addition, the cost to RAI of borrowings under the New Credit Agreement has changed, and the maturity date of the New Credit Agreement is July 29, 2015 (which date may be extended, with the agreement of the requisite lenders, in two separate one year increments) as compared to the maturity date of the revolving credit facility under the Prior Credit Agreement of June 28, 2012. The New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including upon a change in control (as defined therein), that could result in the acceleration of all amounts and cancellation of all commitments outstanding under the New Credit Agreement.
RAI is able to use the revolving credit facility under the New Credit Agreement for borrowings and issuances of letters of credit at its option, subject to a $200 million sublimit on the aggregate amount of letters of credit. Issuances of letters of credit reduce availability under such revolving credit facility. There currently are no borrowings, and approximately $7.1 million of letters of credit outstanding, under the New Credit Agreement.
Under the terms of the New Credit Agreement, RAI is required to pay a facility fee of between 0.20% and 0.40% (based on the facility's credit ratings) per annum on the lender commitments in respect of the revolving credit facility thereunder.
Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement bear interest, at the option of RAI, at a rate equal to an applicable margin (which is based upon the credit ratings assigned to the New Credit Agreement) plus:
 
 
Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest, outstanding under the revolving credit facility under the New Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the rate then in effect with respect to such borrowings, plus 2.0% per annum.
 
The obligations of RAI under the New Credit Agreement are unsecured. Certain of RAI's subsidiaries, including its Material Subsidiaries, have guaranteed RAI's obligations under the New Credit Agreement (such subsidiaries are referred to herein as the ""), pursuant to a Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement dated as of July 29, 2011 (the "") entered into by the Guarantors in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the lenders under the New Credit Agreement. The Subsidiary Guaranty is substantially the same as the subsidiary guaranty in connection with the Prior Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guaranty are unsecured.
Guarantors
Subsidiary Guaranty
The various agents under the New Credit Agreement, or their affiliates, are lenders under such agreement. In addition, certain of these agents, or their affiliates, have from time to time performed, and may in the future perform, various investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, transfer agent and/or other services for RAI for which they have been paid, or will be paid, customary fees.
The New Credit Agreement and the Subsidiary Guaranty related thereto are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

Any amounts received by the applicable Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) and to the applicable Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the applicable Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any Issuing Bank, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by an Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.

Each Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
(i) . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.05(f), then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(f) to reimburse an Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Lenders), be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount, together with interest or profits, if any, thereon, shall (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

Funding of Borrowings

provided
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.06(a) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.

The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting
 
from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Revolving Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Revolving Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Revolving Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iv) if the resulting Revolving Borrowing is a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Revolving Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Revolving Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

If, after giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Swingline Loans and all outstanding Revolving Loans, the aggregate amount of LC Exposure exceeds the Total Commitment as then in effect, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent (at its office identified in Section 2.17) on such date an amount in cash and/or cash equivalents (in U.S. Dollars or, if requested by the Administrative Agent in the case of any LC Exposure with respect to a Letter of Credit denominated in an Approved Alternate Currency, such Approved Alternate Currency) equal to such excess (up to the aggregate amount of LC Exposure at such time) and the Administrative Agent shall hold such payment as security for the Obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders hereunder pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.09(b), such amount, together with interest or profits, if any, thereon, shall (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) be returned to the Borrower within five Business Days after the date on which the requirements of the foregoing sentence would cease to require such cash collateralization.
 
(c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing, that (x) at the Borrower's election in connection with any prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10(b), such prepayment shall not be applied to any Revolving Loan of a Defaulting Lender and (y) the Borrower may repay the Revolving Loans of a Non-Continuing Lender in connection with the termination of the Commitments of such Non-Continuing Lender in accordance with the requirements of clause (iii) of the proviso appearing in Section 2.08(d) without any accompanying repayment of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders, so long as all amounts, if any, due and owing to such Lender (and any other Lenders) pursuant to Section 2.15 are paid at such time.

provided
 
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16. . (a) Each payment by any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.
Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up
(b) . The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower

Indemnification by the Borrower
 
under this Section 2.16(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to any Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing in reasonable detail the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
(e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.16(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Lenders
(f) . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation required by law as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of any documentation described in Section 2.16(f)(iii) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify such Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

Solely for purposes of this Section 2.16(f)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.16(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.16(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid and no indemnified party shall be required to pay any amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16(g) at any time when a Default exists. This Section 2.16(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars.

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

SECTION 2.18. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(b) If (w) any Lender becomes a Non-Continuing Lender at any time after the applicable Extension Response Date occurring after the Effective Date, (x) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, (y) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or (z) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests,
 
rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment (in U.S. Dollars) of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements (for purposes of any participation in an LC Disbursement made under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Approved Alternate Currency, taking the Dollar equivalent of such LC Disbursement) and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of the replacement of any Lender that is a Non-Continuing Lender as contemplated by clause (w) above, the Maturity Date applicable to the assignee's Commitment shall be the Final Maturity Date then in effect. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Each Commitment Increase shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $20,000,000 ( that such amount may be less than $20,000,000 if such amount represents all remaining availability under the limit set forth in the next sentence). Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall set forth the requested amount of the relevant Commitment Increase. Commitment Increases may be provided, by any existing Lender or by any other bank or other financial institution (any such other bank or other financial institution being called an ""), that the Administrative Agent shall have consented (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such Lender's or Additional Lender's providing such Commitment Increases if such consent would be required under Section 9.04 for an assignment of Revolving Loans or Commitments, as applicable, to such Lender or Additional Lender.

The Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.20. The effectiveness of any Incremental Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (it being understood that all references to "the occasion of any Borrowing" or "issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit" or similar language in such Section 4.02 shall be deemed to refer to the effective date of such Incremental Amendment) and such other conditions as the parties thereto shall agree. The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Commitment Increases for any purpose not prohibited by this Agreement. No Lender shall be obligated to provide any Commitment Increases, unless it so agrees. Upon each increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20, (a) each Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each Lender providing a portion of the Commitment Increase (each, a "") in respect of such increase, and each such Commitment Increase Lender will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed, a portion of such Lender's participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans such that, after giving effect to each such deemed assignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding (i) participations hereunder in Letters of Credit and (ii) participations hereunder in Swingline Loans held by each Lender (including each such Commitment Increase Lender) will equal the percentage of the Total Commitment represented by such Lender's Commitment and (b) if, on the date of such increase, there are any Revolving Loans outstanding, such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Commitment Increase be prepaid from the proceeds of additional Revolving Loans made hereunder (reflecting such increase in Commitments), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the Revolving Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Lender in accordance with Section 2.15. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing, borrowing and payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

If, by the date (each, an "") which is 30 days prior to the applicable Extension Date, Continuing Lenders which are not Defaulting Lenders holding at least a majority of the Commitments held by Continuing Lenders which are not Defaulting Lenders agree thereto in writing, the Final Maturity Date, and the Maturity Date of each Continuing Lender then consenting, shall be automatically extended to the date occurring twelve (12) months after the then existing Final Maturity Date. In the event that the Borrower has not obtained the requisite percentage of Continuing Lenders to permit an extension by the relevant Extension Response Date, the Borrower may extend the deadline for obtaining such percentage to the 30th day following such Extension Response Date in order to take such actions with respect to any Lender that is a Non-Continuing Lender after giving effect to such Extension Response Date in order to obtain the requisite percentage of Lenders constituting Continuing Lenders to permit such extension (including actions contemplated by Section 2.18). The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the effectiveness of any such extension. No Lender shall be obligated to grant any extensions pursuant to this Section 2.21, and any such extension shall be in the sole discretion of each of them. A Lender's

The Loan Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm's-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower, its shareholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise the Borrower, its shareholders or its affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to the Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Borrower, its management, shareholders, creditors or any other Person. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Borrower has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto.

Note 9  Commitments and Contingencies
Tobacco Litigation  General
Introduction
Various legal proceedings or claims, including litigation claiming that cancer and other diseases, as well as addiction, have resulted from the use of, or exposure to, RAI's operating subsidiaries' products, are pending or may be instituted against RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. or their affiliates, including RAI and RJR, or indemnitees, including B&W. These pending legal proceedings include claims relating to cigarette products manufactured by RJR Tobacco or certain of its affiliates and indemnitees, as well as claims relating to smokeless tobacco products manufactured by American Snuff Co. A discussion of the legal proceedings relating to cigarette products is set forth below under the heading " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry." All of the references under that heading to tobacco-related litigation, smoking and health litigation and other similar references are references to legal proceedings relating to cigarette products and are not references to legal proceedings involving smokeless tobacco products, and case numbers under that heading include only cases involving cigarette products. The legal proceedings relating to the smokeless tobacco products manufactured by American Snuff Co. are discussed separately under the heading " Smokeless Tobacco Litigation" below.
In connection with the B&W business combination, RJR Tobacco has agreed to indemnify B&W and its affiliates, including its indirect parent, British American Tobacco p.l.c., referred to as BAT, against certain liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by B&W or its affiliates arising out of the U.S. cigarette and tobacco business of B&W. As a result of this indemnity, RJR Tobacco has assumed the defense of pending B&W-specific tobacco-related litigation, has paid the judgments and costs related to certain pre-business combination tobacco-related litigation of B&W, and has posted bonds on behalf of B&W, where necessary, in connection with cases decided since the B&W business combination. In addition, pursuant to this indemnity, RJR Tobacco expensed less than $1 million during the first six months of 2011 and 2010 for funds to be reimbursed to BAT for costs and expenses incurred arising out of certain tobacco-related litigation.
Certain Terms and Phrases
Certain terms and phrases used in this disclosure may require some explanation. The term "judgment" or "final judgment" refers to the final decision of the court resolving the dispute and determining the rights and obligations of the parties. At the trial court level, for example, a final judgment generally is entered by the court after a jury verdict and after post-verdict motions have been decided. In most cases, the losing party can appeal a verdict only after a final judgment has been entered by the trial court.
The term "damages" refers to the amount of money sought by a plaintiff in a complaint, or awarded to a party by a jury or, in some cases, by a judge. "Compensatory damages" are awarded to compensate the prevailing party for actual losses suffered, if liability is proved. In cases in which there is a finding that a defendant has acted willfully, maliciously or fraudulently, generally based on a higher burden of proof than is required for a finding of liability for compensatory damages, a plaintiff also may be awarded "punitive damages." Although damages may be awarded at the trial court stage, a losing party generally may be protected from paying any damages until all appellate avenues have been exhausted by posting a supersedeas bond. The amount of such a bond is governed by the law of the relevant jurisdiction and generally is set at the amount of damages plus some measure of statutory interest, modified at the discretion of the appropriate court or subject to limits set by court or statute.
The term "settlement" refers to certain types of cases in which cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, have agreed to resolve disputes with certain plaintiffs without resolving the case through trial. The principal terms of certain settlements entered into by RJR Tobacco and B&W are explained below under " Accounting for Tobacco-Related Litigation Contingencies."
Theories of Recovery
The plaintiffs seek recovery on a variety of legal theories, including negligence, strict liability in tort, design defect, special duty, voluntary undertaking, breach of warranty, failure to warn, fraud, misrepresentation, unfair trade practices, conspiracy, unjust enrichment, medical monitoring, public nuisance and violations of state and federal antitrust laws. In certain of these cases, the plaintiffs claim that cigarette smoking exacerbated injuries caused by exposure to asbestos.
The plaintiffs seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, treble or multiple damages and statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, and injunctive and other equitable relief. Although alleged damages often are not determinable from a complaint, and the law governing the pleading and calculation of damages varies from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, compensatory and punitive damages have been specifically pleaded in a number of cases, sometimes in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars.
Defenses
The defenses raised by RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and their affiliates and indemnitees include, where applicable and otherwise appropriate, preemption by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of some or all claims arising after 1969, or by the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act for claims arising after 1986, the lack of any defect in the product, assumption of the risk, contributory or comparative fault, lack of proximate cause, remoteness, lack of standing and statutes of limitations or repose. RAI and RJR have asserted additional defenses, including jurisdictional defenses, in many of the cases in which they are named.
Accounting for Tobacco-Related Litigation Contingencies
In accordance with GAAP, RAI and its subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco and American Snuff Co., as applicable, record any loss concerning litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For the reasons set forth below, RAI's management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular pending smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against American Snuff Co., when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable.
RJR Tobacco and its affiliates believe that they have valid defenses to the smoking and health tobacco litigation claims against them, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them. RAI, RJR Tobacco and their affiliates and indemnitees have, through their counsel, filed pleadings and memoranda in pending smoking and health tobacco litigation that set forth and discuss a number of grounds and defenses that they and their counsel believe have a valid basis in law and fact. With the exception of Progeny cases, described below, RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees continue to win the majority of smoking and health tobacco litigation claims that reach trial, and a very high percentage of the tobacco-related litigation claims brought against them continue to be dismissed at or before trial. Based on their experience in the smoking and health tobacco litigation against them and the strength of the defenses available to them in such litigation, RJR Tobacco and its affiliates believe that their successful defense of smoking and health tobacco litigation in the past will continue in the future.
Engle
Except for a $139 million accrual related to an unfavorable judgment in ., a smoking cessation class action, described below, no liability for pending smoking and health tobacco litigation was recorded in RAI's condensed consolidated balance sheet (unaudited) as of June 30, 2011.
Scott v. American Tobacco Co
Generally, RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees have not settled, and currently RJR Tobacco and its affiliates do not intend to settle, any smoking and health tobacco litigation claims. It is the policy of RJR Tobacco and its affiliates to vigorously defend all tobacco-related litigation claims.
The only smoking and health tobacco litigation claims settled by RJR Tobacco and B&W involved:
 
 
The circumstances surrounding the State Settlement Agreements and the funding of a trust fund to benefit the tobacco growers are readily distinguishable from the current categories of smoking and health cases involving RJR Tobacco or its affiliates and indemnitees. The claims underlying the State Settlement Agreements were brought on behalf of the states to recover funds paid for health care and medical and other assistance to state citizens suffering from diseases and conditions allegedly related to tobacco use. The State Settlement Agreements settled all the health-care cost recovery actions brought by, or on behalf of, the settling jurisdictions and contain releases of various additional present and future claims. In accordance with the MSA, various tobacco companies agreed to fund a $5.2 billion trust fund to be used to address the possible adverse economic impact of the MSA on tobacco growers. A discussion of the State Settlement Agreements, and a table depicting the related payment schedule, is set forth below under " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases  State Settlement Agreements."
The states were a unique set of plaintiffs and are not involved in any of the smoking and health cases remaining against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates and indemnitees. Although RJR Tobacco and certain of its affiliates and indemnitees continue to be defendants in health-care cost recovery cases similar in theory to the state cases but involving other plaintiffs, such as Native American tribes and foreign governments, the vast majority of such cases have been dismissed on legal grounds. RJR Tobacco and its affiliates, including RAI, believe that the same legal principles that have resulted in dismissal of health-care cost recovery cases either at the trial court level or on appeal should compel dismissal of the similar pending cases.
As with claims that were resolved by the State Settlement Agreements, the other cases settled by RJR Tobacco can be distinguished from existing cases pending against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees. The original case, discussed below under " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  Class-Action Suits," was settled in the middle of trial during negotiations concerning a possible nation-wide settlement of claims similar to those underlying the State Settlement Agreements.
Broin
RJR Tobacco's Comprehensive Agreement with the Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments resolved all civil claims related to the movement of contraband tobacco products in Canada during the period 1985 through 1999 that the Canadian governments could assert against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates. These claims were separate from any smoking and health tobacco litigation. A discussion of the Canadian matters is set forth below under " Other Litigation and Developments  Claims for Indemnification," and additional details regarding the settlement are set forth in note 5.
Likewise, RJR Tobacco and B&W separately settled the antitrust case which was brought by a unique class of plaintiffs: a class of all tobacco growers and tobacco allotment holders. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants conspired to fix the price of tobacco leaf and to destroy the federal government's tobacco quota and price support program. Despite legal defenses they believed to be valid, RJR Tobacco and B&W separately settled this case to avoid a long and contentious trial with the tobacco growers. The case and the antitrust case currently pending against RJR Tobacco and B&W involve different types of plaintiffs and different theories of recovery under the antitrust laws than the smoking and health cases pending against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees.
DeLoach v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc.,
DeLoach
Finally, as discussed under " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  State Settlement Agreements  Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments," RJR Tobacco and B&W each has settled certain cases brought by states concerning the enforcement of State Settlement Agreements. Despite legal defenses believed to be valid, these cases were settled to avoid further contentious litigation with the states involved. These enforcement actions involve alleged breaches of State Settlement Agreements based on specific actions taken by particular defendants. Accordingly, any future enforcement actions involving State Settlement Agreements will be reviewed by RJR Tobacco on the merits and should not be affected by the settlement of prior enforcement cases.
American Snuff Co. also believes that it has valid defenses to the smokeless tobacco litigation against it. American Snuff Co. asserted and will continue to assert some or all of these defenses in each case at the time and in the manner deemed appropriate by American Snuff Co. and its counsel. No verdict or judgment has been returned or entered against American Snuff Co. on any claim for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of smokeless tobacco. American Snuff Co. intends to defend vigorously all smokeless tobacco litigation claims asserted against it. No liability for pending smokeless tobacco litigation was recorded in RAI's condensed consolidated balance sheet (unaudited) as of June 30, 2011.
Cautionary Statement
Even though RAI's management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular pending smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular case concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against American Snuff Co., when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable, the possibility of material losses related to such litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of any particular litigation pending against RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. or their affiliates or indemnitees, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss.
Although RJR Tobacco believes that it has valid bases for appeals of adverse verdicts in its pending cases, and RJR Tobacco and RAI believe they have valid defenses to all actions, and intend to defend all actions vigorously, it is possible that there could be further adverse developments in pending cases, and that additional cases could be decided unfavorably against RAI, RJR Tobacco or their affiliates or indemnitees. Determinations of liability or adverse rulings in such cases or in similar cases involving other cigarette manufacturers as defendants, even if such judgments are not final, could materially adversely affect the litigation against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees and could encourage the commencement of additional tobacco-related litigation. In addition, a number of political, legislative, regulatory and other developments relating to the tobacco industry and cigarette smoking have received wide media attention. These developments may negatively affect the outcomes of tobacco-related legal actions and encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.
Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of such events on pending litigation and the rate new lawsuits are filed against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, a significant increase in litigation or in adverse outcomes for tobacco defendants, or difficulties in obtaining the bonding required to stay execution of judgments on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on any or all of these entities. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees in litigation matters, it is possible that RAI's results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending litigation matters against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees.
Similarly, smokeless tobacco litigation is subject to many uncertainties. Notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to American Snuff Co., it is possible that RAI's results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending litigation matters against American Snuff Co.
Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry
Overview
 In connection with the B&W business combination, RJR Tobacco agreed to indemnify B&W and its affiliates against, among other things, certain litigation liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by B&W or its affiliates arising out of the U.S. cigarette and tobacco business of B&W. Accordingly, the cases discussed below include cases brought solely against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates, including RAI and RJR; cases brought against both RJR Tobacco, its affiliates and B&W; and cases brought solely against B&W and assumed by RJR Tobacco in the B&W business combination.
Introduction.
During the second quarter of 2011, 37 tobacco-related cases were served against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees. On June 30, 2011, there were 219 cases pending against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees: 208 in the United States; 10 in Canada and one in Israel, as compared with 195 total cases on June 30, 2010. The U.S. case number does not include the 600 individual smoker cases pending in West Virginia state court as a consolidated action, 6,631 Progeny cases (as hereinafter defined), involving approximately 7,963 individual plaintiffs, and 2,588 cases (as hereinafter defined), pending in the United States against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees. Of the U.S. cases pending on June 30, 2011, 24 are pending in federal court, 184 in state court, primarily in the following states: Maryland (53 cases); Florida (31 cases); Missouri (20 cases); New York (17 cases); Louisiana (13 cases); and California (10 cases).

The following table lists the categories of the U.S. tobacco-related cases pending against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees as of June 30, 2011, compared with the number of cases pending against RJR Tobacco, its affiliates or indemnitees as of March 31, 2011, as reported in RAI's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2011, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2011, and a cross-reference to the discussion of each case type.
 
 
Three cases against RJR Tobacco and B&W have attracted significant attention: the Florida state court class-action case, ., the Louisiana state court class-action case, and the case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, referred to as RICO.
Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co
Scott v. American Tobacco Co.,
In 2000, a jury in rendered a punitive damages verdict in favor of the "Florida class" of approximately $145 billion against all defendants. In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court, among other things, affirmed an appellate court's reversal of the punitive damages award, decertified the class going forward, preserved several class-wide findings from the trial, including that nicotine is addictive and cigarettes are defectively designed, and authorized class members to avail themselves of these findings in individual lawsuits under certain conditions. After subsequent motions were resolved, the Florida Supreme Court issued its mandate on January 11, 2007, thus beginning a one-year period in which former class members were permitted to file individual lawsuits. In October 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition for writ of certiorari. As of June 30, 2011, RJR Tobacco had been served in 6,631 Progeny cases in both state and federal courts in Florida. These cases include approximately 7,963 plaintiffs. The number of cases will likely change due to individual plaintiffs being severed from multi-plaintiff cases and multi-plaintiff federal cases being dismissed or consolidated. In addition, as of June 30, 2011, RJR Tobacco was aware of 29 additional cases that had been filed but not served (with 302 plaintiffs). A number of the Progeny cases are scheduled for trial or are in trial.

In 2004, a jury in returned a verdict in favor of the "Louisiana class" for $591 million to establish a state-wide smoking cessation program. In 2007, the Louisiana Court of Appeal upheld class certification, significantly reduced the scope of recovery, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Louisiana and U.S. Supreme Courts denied the defendants' applications for writ of certiorari. In July 2008, the trial court entered an amended judgment in favor of the class for approximately $263 million plus interest from June 30, 2004. In April 2010, the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal amended the final judgment, and as amended, affirmed the judgment. Pursuant to the judgment, the defendants were required to deposit with the court $242 million with judicial interest from July 21, 2008, until paid. In September 2010, the defendants' application for writ of certiorari with the
Scott
Louisiana Supreme Court and emergency motion to stay execution of judgment in the Supreme Court of Louisiana were denied. The U.S. Supreme Court also granted the application to stay the judgment pending applicants' timely filing, and the Court's disposition, of a petition for writ of certiorari. The defendants' petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court was denied on June 27, 2011. RJR Tobacco accrued $139 million, the portion of the judgment allocated to RJR Tobacco and B&W, in the second quarter of 2011.
In the case, brought in 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the government sought, among other forms of relief, the disgorgement of profits pursuant to the civil provisions of RICO. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in 2005 that disgorgement is not an available remedy in the case. The bench trial ended in June 2005, and the court, in August 2006, issued its ruling, among other things, finding certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, liable for the RICO claims, imposing no direct financial penalties on the defendants, but ordering the defendants to make certain "corrective communications" in a variety of media and enjoining the defendants from using certain brand descriptors. Both sides appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In May 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals largely affirmed the findings against the tobacco company defendants and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the parties' petitions for writ of certiorari in June 2010. Post-remand proceedings are underway.

In November 1998, the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, entered into the MSA with 46 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and certain U.S. territories and possessions. These cigarette manufacturers previously settled four other cases, brought on behalf of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota, by separate agreements with each state. These State Settlement Agreements:
 
 
 
 
Payments under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to various adjustments for, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold, relevant market share and inflation. See " Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases  State Settlement Agreements" below for a detailed discussion of the State Settlement Agreements, including RAI's operating subsidiaries' monetary obligations under these agreements. RJR Tobacco records the allocation of settlement charges as products are shipped.
 Trial schedules are subject to change, and many cases are dismissed before trial. It is likely, however, that RJR Tobacco and other cigarette manufacturers will face an increased number of tobacco-related trials in 2011 compared to recent years. There are 9 cases, exclusive of Progeny cases, scheduled for trial as of June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2012, for RJR Tobacco or its affiliates and indemnitees: West Virginia IPIC, five individual smoking and health cases and three other non-smoking and health cases. There are 62 Progeny cases against RJR Tobacco and/or B&W set for trial through June 30, 2012, but it is not known how many of these cases will actually be tried.
Scheduled Trials.
Engle
Engle
 From January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2011, 55 smoking and health and health-care cost recovery cases in which RJR Tobacco or B&W were defendants were tried. Verdicts in favor of RJR Tobacco, B&W and, in some cases, RJR Tobacco, B&W and other defendants, were returned in 30 cases, including 16 mistrials, tried in Florida (26), Missouri (2) and West Virginia (2). Verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs were returned in 23 cases tried in Florida and one in Connecticut.

Individual Smoking and Health Cases
As of June 30, 2011, 139 individual cases were pending in the United States against RJR Tobacco, B&W, as its indemnitee, or both. This category of cases includes smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought by or on behalf of individual plaintiffs, but does not include the Progeny or cases discussed below. A total of 136 of the individual cases are brought by or on behalf of individual smokers or their survivors, while the remaining three cases are brought by or on behalf of individuals or their survivors alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, referred to as ETS.

West Virginia IPIC
Below is a description of the individual smoking and health cases against RJR Tobacco or B&W, or both, which went to trial or were decided during the period from January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011, or remained on appeal as of June 30, 2011.
On August 15, 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favor of B&W in , a case filed in March 1999 in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. The plaintiff, Lois Eiser, sought compensatory and punitive damages in an amount in excess of $50,000, together with interest, costs and attorneys' fees in this wrongful death action against B&W. In January 2006, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the verdict. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's petition to appeal, and on December 28, 2007, remanded the case to the Superior Court for further review of certain issues. In August 2010, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania entered a memorandum affirming the final judgment. In November 2010, the plaintiff filed a petition for permission to appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. A decision is pending.
Eiser v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.
On December 18, 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in a case filed in August 2000 in Supreme Court, Kings County, New York, awarded $350,000 in compensatory damages and eventually returned a verdict of $20 million in punitive damages against the defendants in an action brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco, who was dismissed prior to trial, and B&W. Other manufacturers were dismissed before trial. The plaintiff, Gladys Frankson, alleged that Mr. Frankson became addicted to nicotine, was unable to cease smoking, developed lung cancer and died as a result. The defendants as a group and the deceased smoker were each found to be 50% at fault. On January 9, 2004, the jury awarded $20 million in punitive damages, assigning $6 million to B&W and $2 million to American Tobacco, a predecessor company to B&W. In June 2004, the parties' post-trial motions were denied by the trial
Frankson v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
judge, except that the trial judge granted a new trial unless the parties consented to an increase in compensatory damages to $500,000 and a decrease in punitive damages to $5 million, of which $4 million would be assigned to B&W. The plaintiff stipulated to the reduction in punitive damages in January 2005. Defendants filed a notice of appeal of the orders on post-trial motions in January 2005. In July 2006, the Appellate Division, New York Supreme Court, Second Department, directed that the plaintiffs' claims for design defect be dismissed, but otherwise affirmed the orders denying defendants' post-trial motions. Following remand from this appellate decision, the plaintiff withdrew her request for additur of the compensatory damages, and in December 2006, the trial judge granted this request, and reinstated the original $350,000 compensatory jury verdict.
In June 2007, final judgment was entered against the defendants in the amount of approximately $6.8 million, including interest and costs. The defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division, New York Supreme Court, Second Department. Pursuant to its agreement to indemnify B&W, RJR Tobacco posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of $8.018 million. In September 2009, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmed the compensatory damages award, set aside the punitive damages award and remanded the case to the Kings County Supreme Court for a new trial on punitive damages. No date has been set for the punitive damages retrial.
On February 1, 2005, the jury returned a split verdict in a case filed in May 2003 in Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, finding in favor of B&W on two counts, fraudulent concealment and conspiracy, and finding in favor of the plaintiffs on negligence, which incorporates failure to warn and product defect claims. The plaintiff, Lincoln Smith, claimed that the defendant's tobacco products caused Mrs. Smith's death from lung cancer. The plaintiffs were awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and $20 million in punitive damages; however, the jury found the plaintiff to be 75% at fault, and B&W 25% at fault, and thus the compensatory award was reduced to $500,000. B&W appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals, and in July 2007, the court affirmed the compensatory damages and ordered a new trial on punitive damages. In December 2008, the Missouri Court of Appeals issued an opinion that affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case for further proceedings on the issue of punitive damages. Trial on the issue of punitive damages began in July 2009. On July 29, 2009, RJR Tobacco, on behalf of B&W, paid the compensatory damages verdict, plus interest, in the amount of approximately $700,000. In August 2009, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, finding B&W liable for damages for aggravating circumstances, and on August 20, 2009, awarded the plaintiffs $1.5 million in punitive damages. The court denied the plaintiffs' and the defendant's post-trial motions. B&W and the plaintiffs filed notices of appeal in December 2009. Briefing is underway.

The jury found RJR Tobacco to be 58% at fault and the plaintiff to be 42% at fault, awarded $13.9 million in compensatory damages and found the plaintiff to be entitled to punitive damages. In December 2010, the court awarded the plaintiff $3.97 million in punitive damages. Final judgment was entered on December 30, 2010, in the amount of $11.95 million. RJR Tobacco filed a notice of appeal in January 2011. The court granted the plaintiff's motion for offer of judgment interest, and awarded the plaintiff $15.8 million for the period of December 6, 1999 up to and including December 5, 2010, and approximately $4,000 per day thereafter until an amended judgment was entered.

Hargroves v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co
West Virginia IPIC
In West Virginia, as of June 30, 2011, approximately 600 individual claims remain pending in a consolidated action, The defendants are Philip Morris, Lorillard and RJR Tobacco (including claims concerning The American Tobacco Company and B&W). The Case Management Order currently calls for these cases to be resolved in a two phase procedure  a common issue trial in Phase I, and, if plaintiffs prevail on one or more issues, a Phase II, consisting of individual trials of liability, medical causation, compensatory damages and punitive damages for each of the individual plaintiffs. The Phase I trial will focus on whether defendants manufactured defective products, whether their conduct was tortious and whether their conduct meets the standard for a potential award of punitive damages under West Virginia law. There will be no lump sum award of punitive damages and the Phase I jury will not be asked to set a punitive multiplier. Instead, if the jury finds that a defendant's conduct meets the punitive standard, then plaintiffs in their individual trials in Phase II will have the chance to ask Phase II juries to consider awarding punitive damages to each plaintiff on a case-by-case basis. Phase I trials were initiated twice in 2010 in Kanawha County (Charleston), resulting in mistrials in February and June 2010, due to an inability to find a sufficient number of impartial jurors from which to select a jury. The Court has now moved the case to Ohio County (Wheeling) with a new Phase I trial to commence October 17, 2011.
In re: Tobacco Litigation Individual Personal Injury Cases.
Engle and Engle Progeny Cases
Trial began in July 1998 in a case filed in May 1994, in Circuit Court, Miami-Dade County, Florida, in which a class consisting of Florida residents, or their survivors, alleged diseases or medical conditions caused by their alleged "addiction" to cigarettes. The action was brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, seeking actual damages and punitive damages in excess of $100 billion each and the creation of a medical fund to compensate individuals for future health-care costs. In July 1999, the jury found against RJR Tobacco, B&W and the other cigarette-manufacturer defendants in the initial phase, which included common issues related to certain elements of liability, general causation and a potential award of, or entitlement to, punitive damages.
Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
On July 14, 2000, in the second phase of the trial, the jury returned a punitive damages verdict in favor of the "Florida class" of approximately $145 billion against all the defendants, with approximately $36.3 billion and $17.6 billion being assigned to RJR Tobacco and B&W, respectively.
In November 2000, the trial judge denied all post-trial motions and entered judgment. The Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's final judgment and remanded the case to the Miami-Dade County Circuit Court with instructions to decertify the class. The class appealed, and the Florida Supreme Court accepted the case in May 2004.
In July 2006, the court affirmed the dismissal of the punitive damages award and decertified the class, on a going-forward basis. The court preserved a number of class-wide findings from Phase I of the trial, including that cigarettes can cause certain diseases, that nicotine is addictive and that defendants placed defective and unreasonably dangerous cigarettes on the market, and authorized former class members to avail themselves of those findings under certain conditions in individual lawsuits, provided they commence those lawsuits within one year of the date the court's decision became final. The court specified that the eligible plaintiffs are confined to those Florida citizen residents who suffered or died from smoking-related illnesses that "manifested" themselves on or before November 21, 1996, and that were caused by an addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine.
In August 2006, RJR Tobacco and the other defendants filed a rehearing motion arguing, among other things, that the findings from the trial were not sufficiently specific to serve as the basis for further proceedings and that the Florida Supreme Court's decision denied the defendants due process. The plaintiffs also filed a rehearing motion arguing that some smokers who became sick after November 21, 1996, and who were therefore not class members, should nevertheless have the statute of limitations tolled since they may have refrained from filing suit earlier in the mistaken belief that they were class members. In December 2006, the Florida Supreme Court withdrew its July 2006, decision and issued a revised opinion, in which it set aside the jury's findings of a conspiracy to misrepresent and clarified that the jury's finding on express warranty were preserved for use by eligible plaintiffs. The court also denied the plaintiffs' motion and confirmed that the eligible plaintiffs were limited to those individuals who developed alleged smoking-related illnesses that manifested themselves on or before November 21, 1996.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the defendants' petition for writ of certiorari and petition for rehearing with the U.S. Supreme Court were both denied.
Pursuant to the Florida Supreme Court's July 2006, ruling in which decertified the class, eligible plaintiffs had one year from January 11, 2007, in which to file individual lawsuits. In addition, some individuals who filed suit prior to January 11, 2007, and who claim they meet the conditions in also are attempting to avail themselves of the ruling. Lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the ruling, whether filed before or after the January 11, 2007, mandate, are referred to as the Progeny cases. As of June 30, 2011, RJR Tobacco had been served in 6,631 Progeny cases in both state and federal courts in Florida. These cases include approximately 7,963 plaintiffs. The number of cases will likely change due to individual plaintiffs being severed from multi-plaintiff cases. Many of these cases are in active discovery or nearing trial.

Three federal district courts ruled that the findings in the first phase of the proceedings cannot be used to satisfy elements of plaintiffs' claims, and two of those rulings, in . and ., were certified by the trial court for interlocutory review. In July 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held, as a matter of Florida law, that the findings from the first phase of the proceedings cannot be given greater effect than what the jury found. Because it rejected plaintiffs' approach on state-law grounds, the court did not find it necessary to consider whether that approach would violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

Burr v. Philip Morris USA, Inc
Engle
Engle
On December 14, 2010, the First District Court of Appeal  an intermediate state appellate court  rejected the Eleventh Circuit's holding and concluded, in the . case, that the findings "establish the conduct of elements" of plaintiffs' claims. On July 19, 2011, the Florida Supreme Court denied RJR Tobacco's request to review the decision of the intermediate state appellate court. The holding on the findings is expected to be given binding precedential effect in state trial courts throughout Florida and likely supersedes the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of state law even in the federal cases. As a result, the defendants have asked the federal district courts in Jacksonville and Tampa to rule on their constitutional due process objection to the use of the findings to satisfy elements of plaintiffs' claims. The federal district court in Jacksonville has scheduled a hearing for September 7, 2011, to further address the use of the findings and defendants' due process challenge.

In June 2009, Florida amended its existing bond cap statute by adding a $200 million bond cap that applied to all Progeny cases in the aggregate. In May, 2011, Florida removed the provision that allowed it to expire on December 31, 2012. The bond cap for any given individual Progeny case varies depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time, but never exceeds $5 million per case. The legislation, which became effective in June 2009 and 2011, applies to judgments entered after the original 2009 effective date. The plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap in four of the cases discussed below. The Alachua County court upheld the bond cap in three of those cases. The plaintiffs have appealed to the First District Court of Appeal. Argument in the fourth case took place in a trial court in Escambia County in January 2011; in that case, ., the trial court upheld the bond cap. The First District Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's decision on April 12, 2011. The First District Court of Appeal issued a written opinion in , on July 12, 2011, explaining why the statute is constitutional. The court also stated that the issues are likely to continue until they are definitively resolved by the Florida Supreme Court. As a result, the court certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether the bond cap violates the Florida Constitution by limiting the amount of the bond necessary to obtain an automatic stay of the judgment against a signatory to the tobacco settlement agreement with the State of Florida.

Weingart v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co
Broin II Cases
RJR Tobacco, B&W and other cigarette manufacturer defendants settled in October 1997. This case had been brought in Florida state court on behalf of flight attendants alleged to have suffered from diseases or ailments caused by exposure to ETS in airplane cabins. The settlement agreement required the participating tobacco companies to pay a total of $300 million in three annual $100 million installments, allocated among the companies by market share, to fund research on the early detection and cure of diseases associated with tobacco smoke. It also required those companies to pay a total of $49 million for the plaintiffs' counsel's fees and expenses. RJR Tobacco's portion of these payments was approximately $86 million; B&W's portion of these payments was approximately $57 million. The settlement agreement bars class members from bringing aggregate claims or obtaining punitive damages and also bars individual claims to the extent that they are based on fraud, misrepresentation, conspiracy to commit fraud or misrepresentation, RICO, suppression, concealment or any other alleged intentional or willful conduct. The defendants agreed that, in any individual case brought by a class member, the defendant will bear the burden of proof with respect to whether ETS can cause certain specifically enumerated diseases, referred to as "general causation." With respect to all other issues relating to liability, including whether an individual plaintiff's disease was caused by his or her exposure to ETS in airplane cabins, referred to as "specific causation," the individual plaintiff will have the burden of proof. On September 7, 1999, the Florida Supreme Court approved the settlement. The cases arose out of the settlement of this case.
Broin v. Philip Morris, Inc.
Broin II
On October 5, 2000, the court entered an order applicable to all cases that the terms of the settlement agreement do not require the individual plaintiffs to prove the elements of strict liability, breach of warranty or negligence. Under this order, there is a rebuttable presumption in the plaintiffs' favor on those elements, and the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that their alleged adverse health effects actually were caused by exposure to ETS in airplane cabins, that is, specific causation.

Class-Action Suits
 As of June 30, 2011, 15 class-action cases, exclusive of one antitrust class action, were pending in the United States against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees. In 1996, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in overturned the certification of a nation-wide class of persons whose claims related to alleged addiction to tobacco products. Since this ruling by the Fifth Circuit, most class-action suits have sought certification of state-wide, rather than nation-wide, classes. Class-action suits based on claims similar to those asserted in or claims that class members are at a greater risk of injury or injured by the use of tobacco or exposure to ETS are pending against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees in state or federal courts in California, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, West Virginia, New Mexico and Arizona. All pending class-action cases are discussed below.
Overview.
Castano v. American Tobacco Co.
Castano
The pending class actions against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees include nine cases alleging that the use of the term "lights" constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices under state law or violates the federal RICO statute. Such suits are pending in state or federal courts in Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico and Arizona and are discussed below under " Lights' Cases."
Finally, certain third-party payers have filed health-care cost recovery actions in the form of class actions. These cases are discussed below under " Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases."
Few smoker class-action complaints have been certified or, if certified, have survived on appeal. Eighteen federal courts, including two courts of appeals, and most state courts that have considered the issue have rejected class certification in such cases. Apart from the case discussed above, only two smoker class actions have been certified by a federal court  and , discussed below under " Lights' Cases" both of which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and ultimately decertified.

In re Simon (II) Litigation,
Schwab [McLaughlin] v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.
,
 On November 5, 1998, in a case filed in District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, the trial court certified a medical monitoring or smoking cessation class of Louisiana residents who were smokers on or before May 24, 1996, in an action brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, seeking to recover an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. In July 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' claim for medical monitoring and found that cigarettes were not defectively designed. However, the jury also made certain findings against the defendants on claims relating to fraud, conspiracy, marketing to minors and smoking cessation. Notwithstanding these findings, this portion of the trial did not determine liability as to any class member or class representative. What primarily remained in the case was a class-wide claim that the defendants pay for a program to help people stop smoking.
Medical Monitoring and Smoking Cessation Case.
Scott v. American Tobacco Co.,
In May 2004, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $591 million on the class's claim for a smoking cessation program. In September 2004, the defendants posted a $50 million bond, pursuant to legislation that limits the amount of the bond to $50 million collectively for MSA signatories, and noticed their appeal. RJR Tobacco posted $25 million (the portions for RJR Tobacco and B&W) towards the bond. In February 2007, the Louisiana Court of Appeals upheld the class certification and found the defendants responsible for funding smoking cessation for eligible class members. The appellate court also ruled, however, that the defendants were not liable for any post-1988 claims, rejected the award of prejudgment interest, struck eight of the 12 components of the smoking cessation program and remanded the case for further proceedings. In particular, the appellate court ruled that no class member, who began smoking after September 1, 1988, could receive any relief, and that only those smokers, whose claims accrued on or before September 1, 1988, would be eligible for the smoking cessation program. The plaintiffs have expressly represented to the trial court that none of their claims accrued before 1988 and that the class claims did not accrue until around 1996, when the case was filed. The defendants' application for writ of certiorari with the
Louisiana Supreme Court was denied in January 2008. The defendants' petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in June 2008. In July 2008, the trial court entered an amended judgment in the case, finding that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for funding the cost of a court-supervised smoking cessation program and ordered the defendants to deposit approximately $263 million together with interest from June 30, 2004, into a trust for the funding of the program. The court also stated that it would favorably consider a motion to return to defendants a portion of unused funds at the close of each program year in the event the monies allocated for the preceding program year were not fully expended because of a reduction in class size or underutilization by the remaining plaintiffs.
In December 2008, the trial court judge signed an order granting the defendants an appeal from the amended judgment. In April 2010, the court of appeals amended but largely affirmed the trial court's July 2008 judgment and ordered the defendants to deposit with the court $242 million with judicial interest from July 21, 2008, until paid. The defendants' motion for rehearing was denied. In September 2010, the defendants' application for writ of certiorari or review and their emergency motion to stay execution of judgment with the Louisiana Supreme Court were denied. In September 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendant's motion to stay the judgment pending applicants' timely filing, and the Court's disposition, of a petition for writ of certiorari. The defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2010. The court denied the petition on June 27, 2011. RJR Tobacco accrued $139 million, the portions of the judgment allocated to RJR Tobacco and B&W, in the second quarter of 2011.
 On April 11, 2001, in a case filed in June 1997 in Superior Court, San Diego County, California, the court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for certification of a class composed of residents of California who smoked at least one of the defendants' cigarettes from June 10, 1993 through April 23, 2001, and who were exposed to the defendants' marketing and advertising activities in California. The action was brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, seeking to recover restitution, disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief under California Business and Professions Code  17200 et seq. and  17500 et seq. Certification was granted as to the plaintiffs' claims that the defendants violated  17200 of the California Business and Professions Code pertaining to unfair competition. The court, however, refused to certify the class under the California Legal Remedies Act and on the plaintiffs' common law claims. In March 2005, the court granted the defendants' motion to decertify the class, and in September 2006, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the order decertifying the class. In November 2006, the plaintiffs' petition for review with the California Supreme Court was granted, and in May 2009, the court reversed the decision of the trial court, and the California Court of Appeal that decertified the class and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. In March 2010, the trial court found that the plaintiffs' "lights" claims were not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and denied the defendants' second motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a tenth amended complaint in September 2010. RJR Tobacco and B&W filed their answers to the complaint, and discovery is underway. Subsequently, on February 24, 2011, the court found that the named class representatives were not adequate, were not typical, and lacked standing. The plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration was denied. The court tentatively granted the plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint by adding new class representatives and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss.
California Business and Professions Code Cases.
Brown v. American Tobacco Co., Inc.,
In a class action filed in November 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the plaintiffs brought the case on behalf of all persons who tried unsuccessfully to redeem Camel Cash certificates from 1991 through March 31, 2007, or who held Camel Cash certificates as of March 31, 2007. The plaintiffs allege that in response to the defendants' action to discontinue redemption of Camel Cash as of March 31, 2007, customers, like the plaintiffs, attempted to exchange their Camel Cash for merchandise and that the defendants, however, did not have any merchandise to exchange for Camel Cash. The plaintiffs allege unfair business practices, deceptive practices, breach of contract and promissory estoppel. The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, actual damages, costs and expenses. In January 2010, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which prompted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in February 2010. The class definition changed to a class consisting of all persons who reside in the U.S. and tried unsuccessfully to redeem Camel Cash certificates, from October 1, 2006 (six months before the defendant ended the Camel Cash program) or who held Camel Cash certificates as of March 31, 2007. The plaintiffs also brought the class on behalf of a proposed California subclass, consisting of all California residents meeting the same criteria. In May 2010, RJR Tobacco's motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction over subject matter and, alternatively, for failure to state a claim was granted with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. In July 2010, RJR Tobacco's
Sateriale v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was granted with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, and RJR Tobacco filed a motion to dismiss it in September 2010. In December 2010, the court granted RJR Tobacco's motion to dismiss with prejudice. Final judgment was entered by the court and the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in January 2011. Briefing is underway.
 As noted above, "lights" class-action cases are pending against RJR Tobacco or B&W in Illinois (3), Missouri (2), Minnesota (2), New Mexico (1) and Arizona (1). The classes in these cases generally seek to recover $50,000 to $75,000 per class member for compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and other forms of relief, and attorneys' fees and costs from RJR Tobacco and/or B&W. In general, the plaintiffs allege that RJR Tobacco or B&W made false and misleading claims that "lights" cigarettes were lower in tar and nicotine and/or were less hazardous or less mutagenic than other cigarettes. The cases typically are filed pursuant to state consumer protection and related statutes.
"Lights" Cases.
Many of these "lights" cases were stayed pending review of the . case by the U.S. Supreme Court. In that "lights" class-action case pending against Altria Group, Inc. and Philip Morris USA, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that these claims are not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act or by the Federal Trade Commission's, referred to as FTC, historic regulation of the industry. Since this decision in December 2008, a number of the stayed cases have become active again.
Good v. Altria Group, Inc
The seminal "lights" class-action case involves RJR Tobacco's competitor, Philip Morris, Inc. Trial began in . in January 2003. In March 2003, the trial judge entered judgment against Philip Morris in the amount of $7.1 billion in compensatory damages and $3 billion in punitive damages to the State of Illinois. Based on Illinois law, the bond required to stay execution of the judgment was set initially at $12 billion. Philip Morris pursued various avenues of relief from the $12 billion bond requirement. On December 15, 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and sent the case back to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the case. On December 5, 2006, the trial court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss and for entry of final judgment. The case was dismissed with prejudice the same day. In December 2008, the plaintiffs filed a petition for relief from judgment, stating that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in . rejected the basis for the reversal. The trial court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition for relief from judgment in February 2009. In March 2009, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court, Fifth Judicial District, requesting a reversal of the February 2009 order and remand to the circuit court. On February 24, 2011, the appellate court entered an order, concluding that the two-year time limit for filing a petition for relief from a final judgment began to run when the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs' lawsuit on December 18, 2006. The appellate court therefore found that the petition was timely, reversed the order of the trial court, and remanded the case for further proceedings. On May 5, 2011, Philip Morris filed a petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.

In a case filed in April 2003, and pending in District Court, Hennepin County, Minnesota, a judge dismissed the case in May 2005, ruling the "lights" claims are preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. In July 2005, the plaintiffs appealed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals for the Fourth Judicial District. During the pendency of the appeal, RJR Tobacco removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. In February 2007, the Eighth Circuit remanded the case to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which in December 2007, reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the District Court. In January 2009, the Minnesota Supreme Court issued an order vacating the February 2008 order that granted RJR Tobacco's petition for review.

Dahl
Curtis v. Altria Group, Inc.
In a case filed in June 1998, and pending in Circuit Court, Cook County, Illinois, the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification in December 2001, in an action brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W. The case was brought on behalf of persons who have allegedly been injured by (1) the defendants' purported conspiracy pursuant to which defendants concealed material facts regarding the addictive nature of nicotine, (2) the defendants' alleged acts of targeting their advertising and marketing to minors, and (3) the defendants' claimed breach of the public right to defendants' compliance with the laws prohibiting the distribution of cigarettes to minors. The plaintiffs requested that the defendants be required to disgorge all profits unjustly received through their sale of cigarettes to plaintiffs and the class, which in no event will be greater than $75,000 per each class member, inclusive of punitive damages, interest and costs. In March 2006, the court dismissed count V, public nuisance, and count VI, unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in March 2009, to add a claim of unjust enrichment and, to include in the class, individuals who smoked "light" cigarettes. RJR Tobacco and B&W answered the amended complaint in March 2009. In July 2009, the plaintiffs filed an additional motion for class certification. In September 2009, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the pleadings concerning the "lights" claims as to all defendants other than Philip Morris. In February 2010, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification of all three putative classes. However, the court ruled that the plaintiffs may reinstate the class dealing with the conspiracy to conceal the addictive nature of nicotine if they identify a new class representative. In April 2010, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to file a fourth amended complaint and withdraw the motion to reinstate count I by identifying a new plaintiff. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' fourth amended complaint, which was granted in June 2010. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider, and in August 2010, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Oral argument occurred on April 7, 2011. A decision is pending.
Cleary v. Philip Morris, Inc.,
In ., a case filed in August 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico against RJR Tobacco and RAI, the plaintiffs brought the case on behalf of all New Mexico residents who from July 1, 2004, to the date of judgment, purchased, not for resale, the defendants' cigarettes labeled as "lights" or "ultra-lights." The plaintiffs allege fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranties of merchantability and of fitness for a particular purpose, violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, unjust enrichment, negligence and gross negligence. The plaintiffs seek a variety of damages, including actual, compensatory and consequential damages to the plaintiff and the class but not damages for personal injury or health-care claims. Discovery is underway.
VanDyke v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co
In a case filed in October 2009 in the Superior Court of Pima County, Arizona against RJR Tobacco, RAI and other defendants, the plaintiffs brought the case on behalf of all persons residing in Arizona who purchased, not for resale, defendants' cigarettes labeled as "light" or "ultra-light" from the date of the defendants' first sales of such cigarettes in Arizona to the date of judgment. The plaintiffs allege consumer fraud, concealment, nondisclosure, negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs seek a variety of damages, including compensatory, restitutionary and punitive damages. In November 2009, the defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, and RJR Tobacco and RAI filed their answers to the complaint. Discovery is underway. The case was referred to mediation in May 2011 to determine whether the case might be suitable for mediation. A decision is pending.
Shaffer v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
As referred to in the " in the event RJR Tobacco and its affiliates or indemnitees lose one or more of the pending "lights" class-action suits, RJR Tobacco could face bonding difficulties depending upon the amount of damages ordered, if any, which could have a material adverse effect on RJR Tobacco's, and consequently RAI's, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Cautionary Statements,"
Ina case filed in November 1997 in Circuit Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, the plaintiffs brought an ETS class action against U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and parent companies of U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, on behalf of all residents of Louisiana who, though not themselves cigarette smokers, have been exposed to secondhand smoke from cigarettes which were manufactured by the defendants, and who allegedly suffered injury as a result of that exposure. The plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. In October 2004, the trial court stayed this case pending the outcome of the appeal in ., discussed above under Medical Monitoring and Smoking Cessation Case
Other Class Actions.
Young v. American Tobacco Co., Inc.,
Scott v. American Tobacco Co., Inc
" 
."
a case filed in February 1998 in Circuit Court, Ohio County, West Virginia, the plaintiff sued asbestos manufacturers, U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and parent companies of U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, seeking to recover $1 million in compensatory and punitive damages individually and an unspecified amount for the class in both compensatory and punitive damages. The class was brought on behalf of persons who allegedly have personal injury claims arising from their exposure to respirable asbestos fibers and cigarette smoke. The plaintiffs allege that Mrs. Parsons' use of tobacco products and exposure to asbestos products caused her to develop lung cancer and to become addicted to tobacco. In December 2000, three defendants, Nitral Liquidators, Inc., Desseaux Corporation of North American and Armstrong World Industries, filed bankruptcy petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Pursuant to section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, is automatically stayed with respect to all defendants.

Finally, in a case filed in December 1998 in Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, the defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri in February 1999. The action was brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and parent companies of U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, by tobacco product users and purchasers on behalf of all similarly situated Missouri consumers. The plaintiffs allege that their use of the defendants' tobacco products has caused them to become addicted to nicotine. The plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. The case was remanded to the Circuit Court in February 1999. There has been limited activity in this case.
Jones v. American Tobacco Co., Inc.,
Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases
Health-care cost recovery cases have been brought by a variety of plaintiffs. Other than certain governmental actions, these cases largely have been unsuccessful on remoteness grounds, which means that one who pays an injured person's medical expenses is legally too remote to maintain an action against the person allegedly responsible for the injury.
As of June 30, 2011, three health-care cost recovery cases were pending in the United States against RJR Tobacco, B&W, as its indemnitee, or both, as discussed below after the discussion of the State Settlement Agreements. A limited number of claimants have filed suit against RJR Tobacco, its current or former affiliates, B&W and other tobacco industry defendants to recover funds for health care, medical and other assistance paid by foreign provincial governments in treating their citizens. For more information on these cases, see " International Cases" below.
 In June 1994, the Mississippi Attorney General brought an action, , against various industry members, including RJR Tobacco and B&W. This case was brought on behalf of the state to recover state funds paid for health care and other assistance to state citizens suffering from diseases and conditions allegedly related to tobacco use. Most other states, through their attorneys general or other state agencies, sued RJR Tobacco, B&W and other U.S. cigarette manufacturers based on similar theories. The cigarette manufacturer defendants, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, settled the first four of these cases scheduled for trial  Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota  by separate agreements with each such state.
State Settlement Agreements.
Moore v. American Tobacco Co.
On November 23, 1998, the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, entered into the Master Settlement Agreement with attorneys general representing the remaining 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Marianas. Effective on November 12, 1999, the MSA settled all the health-care cost recovery actions brought by, or on behalf of, the settling jurisdictions and released various additional present and future claims.
In the settling jurisdictions, the MSA released RJR Tobacco, B&W, and their affiliates and indemnitees, including RAI, from:
 
 
Set forth below are tables depicting the unadjusted tobacco industry settlement payment schedule and the settlement payment schedule for RAI's operating subsidiaries under the State Settlement Agreements, and related information for 2009 and beyond:
 
 
 
The State Settlement Agreements also contain provisions restricting the marketing of tobacco products. Among these provisions are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of cartoon characters, brand-name sponsorships, apparel and other merchandise, outdoor and transit advertising, payments for product placement, free sampling and lobbying. Furthermore, the State Settlement Agreements required the dissolution of three industry-sponsored research and trade organizations.
The State Settlement Agreements have materially adversely affected RJR Tobacco's shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobacco's share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the State Settlement Agreements.
 On September 22, 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an action against RJR Tobacco, B&W and other tobacco companies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The government initially sought to recover federal funds expended by the federal government in providing health care to smokers who developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-related, based on several federal statutes. In addition, the government sought, pursuant to the civil provisions of RICO, disgorgement of profits the government contends were earned as a consequence of a RICO racketeering "enterprise." In September 2000, the court dismissed the government's claims asserted under the Medical Care Recovery Act as well as those under the Medicare Secondary Payer provisions of the Social Security Act, but did not dismiss the RICO claims. In February 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that disgorgement is not an available remedy in this case. The government's petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in October 2005. The non-jury, bench trial began in September 2004, and closing arguments concluded in June 2005.
Department of Justice Case.
On August 17, 2006, the court found certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, liable for the RICO claims, but did not impose any direct financial penalties. The court instead enjoined the defendants from committing future racketeering acts, participating in certain trade organizations, making misrepresentations concerning smoking
and health and youth marketing, and using certain brand descriptors such as "low tar," "light," "ultra light," "mild" and "natural." The court also ordered defendants to issue "corrective communications" on five subjects, including smoking and health and addiction, and to comply with further undertakings, including maintaining web sites of historical corporate documents and disseminating certain marketing information on a confidential basis to the government. In addition, the court placed restrictions on the ability of the defendants to dispose of certain assets for use in the United States, unless the transferee agrees to abide by the terms of the court's order, and ordered the defendants to reimburse the U.S. Department of Justice its taxable costs incurred in connection with the case.
Certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco, filed notices of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in September 2006. The government filed its notice of appeal in October 2006. In addition, the defendants, including RJR Tobacco, filed joint motions asking the district court to clarify and to stay its order pending the defendants' appeal. On September 28, 2006, the district court denied the defendants' motion to stay. On September 29, 2006, the defendants, including RJR Tobacco, filed a motion asking the court of appeals to stay the district court's order pending the defendants' appeal. The court granted the motion in October 2006.
In November 2006, the court of appeals stayed the appeals pending the trial court's ruling on the defendants' motion for clarification. The defendants' motion was granted in part and denied in part. The defendants' motion as to the meaning and applicability of the general injunctive relief of the August 2006 order was denied. The request for clarification as to the scope of the provisions in the order prohibiting the use of descriptors and requiring corrective statements at retail point of sale was granted. The court also ruled that the provisions prohibiting the use of express or implied health messages or descriptors do apply to the actions of the defendants taken outside of the United States.
In May 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals largely affirmed the finding of liability against the tobacco defendants and remanded to the trial court for dismissal of the trade organizations. The court also largely affirmed the remedial order, including the denial of additional remedies, but vacated the order and remanded for further proceedings as to the following four discrete issues:
 
 
 
 
RJR Tobacco, B&W and the Department of Justice filed petitions for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2010. In June 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the parties' petitions for writ of certiorari. Post-remand proceedings are underway to determine the extent to which the original order will be implemented. The defendants filed a motion to vacatur, in which they moved to vacate the trial court's injunctions and factual findings and dismiss the case in its entirety, on March 3, 2011. The court denied the motion on June 1, 2011.
 Five health-care reimbursement cases are pending against RJR Tobacco, its current or former affiliates, or B&W outside the United States, four in Canada and one in Israel. In these actions, foreign governments are seeking to recover for health care, medical and other assistance paid in treating their citizens for tobacco-related disease. No such actions are pending in the United States. Pursuant to the terms of the 1999 sale of RJR Tobacco's international tobacco business, RJR Tobacco has tendered the defense of these actions to JTI. Subject to a reservation of rights, JTI has assumed the defense of RJR Tobacco and its current or former affiliates in these actions.
International Cases.
 
 
 
 
The following six putative Canadian class actions were filed against various Canadian and non-Canadian tobacco-related entities, including RJR Tobacco and one of its affiliates, in courts in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan, although the plaintiffs' counsel have been actively pursuing only the action pending in Saskatchewan at this time:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In each of these six cases, the plaintiffs allege fraud, fraudulent concealment, breach of warranty, breach of warranty of merchantability and of fitness for a particular purpose, failure to warn, design defects, negligence, breach of a "special duty" to children and adolescents, conspiracy, concert of action, unjust enrichment, market share liability, joint liability, and violations of various trade practices and competition statutes. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and aggravated damages; punitive or exemplary damages; the right to waive the torts described above
and claim disgorgement of the amount of revenues or profits the defendants received from the sale of tobacco products to putative class members; interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act and other similar legislation; and other relief the court deems just. Pursuant to the terms of the 1999 sale of RJR Tobacco's international tobacco business, RJR Tobacco has tendered the defense of these six actions to JTI. Subject to a reservation of rights, JTI has assumed the defense of RJR Tobacco and its current or former affiliates in these actions.
 As of June 30, 2011, one Native American tribe case was pending before a tribal court against RJR Tobacco and B&W, a case filed in September 1997 in Tribal Court, Crow Creek Sioux, South Dakota. The plaintiffs seek to recover actual and punitive damages, restitution, funding of a clinical cessation program, funding of a corrective public education program, and disgorgement of unjust profits from sales to minors. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants are liable under the following theories: unlawful marketing and targeting of minors, contributing to the delinquency of minors, unfair and deceptive acts or practices, unreasonable restraint of trade and unfair method of competition, negligence, negligence per se, conspiracy and restitution of unjust enrichment. The case is dormant.
Native American Tribe Cases.
Crow Creek Sioux Tribe v. American Tobacco Co.,
 As of June 30, 2011, no cases brought by hospitals were pending against cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W. In , filed in November 1998, in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, hospitals sought recovery of uncompensated, unreimbursed health-care costs expended or to be expended on behalf of patients who suffer, or have suffered, from illnesses allegedly resulting from the use of cigarettes. In June 2005, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to claims for damages which accrued prior to November 16, 1993. In June 2010, the court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment on failure to warn claims, negligent omission claims, and all related targeting marketing claims and allegations based on federal preemption. In September 2010, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims concerning ETS and plaintiffs' claims for damages based on the loss of use of monies prior to judgment. In October 2010, the court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment on misrepresentation, concealment and omission. The remaining motions for summary judgment were denied. On April 29, 2011, the jury returned a verdict in favor of all defendants. Final judgment was entered on June 10, 2011. The parties agreed that the plaintiffs would waive all rights to appeal, including the right to file any post-trial motions, and each party would bear its own costs. All interlocutory and/or outstanding issues in the case were merged into the judgment.

Other Cases
In August 2009, RJR Tobacco and American Snuff Co. joined other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer in filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (challenging certain provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, referred to as the FDA Tobacco Act, that severely restricts the few remaining channels available to communicate with adult tobacco consumers. RAI believes these provisions cannot be justified on any basis consistent with the demands of the First Amendment. The suit does not challenge the U.S. Congress's decision to give the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products, nor does it challenge the vast majority of the provisions of the new law. In November 2009, the court denied certain plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction as to the modified risk tobacco products provision of the FDA Tobacco Act. The parties finished briefing their respective cross-motions for summary judgment in December 2009, and in January 2010, the court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs so as to allow the continued use of color and imagery in labeling and advertising and the right to make statements that their products conform to FDA regulatory requirements. The court granted summary judgment to the U.S. Government as to all other challenged provisions. In March 2010, each side filed a notice of appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument is scheduled for July 27, 2011.
Commonwealth Brands, Inc., v. United States of America),
On February 25, 2011, RJR Tobacco, Lorillard Inc., and Lorillard Tobacco Company jointly filed a lawsuit, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the composition of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, referred to as the TPSAC, which had been established by the FDA. The complaint alleges that certain members of the TPSAC and certain members of its Constituents Subcommittee have financial and appearance conflicts of interest that are disqualifying under federal ethics law and regulations, and that the TPSAC is not "fairly balanced," as required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, referred to as FACA. In March 2011, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added an additional claim, based on a nonpublic meeting of members of the TPSAC, in violation of the FACA. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss in April 2011.
For a detailed description of the FDA Tobacco Act, see " Governmental Activity" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in Item 7.
Finally, RJR Tobacco and others brought suit against the City of Worcester, Massachusetts to enjoin enforcement of an ordinance prohibiting all outdoor advertising of tobacco products and any indoor advertising that is visible from the street. The suit, , was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central Division of Massachusetts on June 17, 2011. The City and the other defendants agreed to stay enforcement of the ordinance until after a ruling on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.
National Association of Tobacco Outlets, Inc. v. City of Worcester
State Settlement Agreements-Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments
As of June 30, 2011, there were 33 cases concerning the enforcement, validity or interpretation of the State Settlement Agreements in which RJR Tobacco or B&W is a party. This number includes those cases, discussed below, relating to disputed payments under the State Settlement Agreements.
The Vermont Attorney General filed suit in July 2005, in the Vermont Superior Court, Chittenden County, alleging that certain advertising for the Eclipse cigarette brand violated both the MSA and the Vermont Consumer Fraud Statute. The State of Vermont is seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. The bench trial in this action began on October 6, 2008, and lasted a total of five weeks. Closing arguments occurred on March 11, 2009. On March 10, 2010, the court issued its opinion, finding that three of the advertising claims made by RJR Tobacco were not supported by the appropriate degree of scientific evidence. The court did, however, rule that the remaining six advertising claims challenged by the State of Vermont were not actionable. The court indicated that remedies and any damages to be awarded, as well as the issue of attorney's fees and litigation expenses, will be addressed in additional proceedings. On March 22, 2010, RJR Tobacco filed a motion to amend findings of fact that it believes are demonstrably contrary to, or unsupported by, the record. On December 14, 2010, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part RJR Tobacco's motion. On March 18, 2011, a scheduling order was entered, leading to an October 3, 2011 trial date on the remaining issues.
In April 2005, the Mississippi Attorney General notified B&W of its intent to seek approximately $3.9 million in additional payments under the Mississippi Settlement Agreement. The Mississippi Attorney General asserts that B&W failed to report in its net operating profit or its shipments, cigarettes manufactured by B&W under contract for Star Tobacco or its parent, Star Scientific, Inc. B&W advised the state that it did not owe the state any money. In August 2005, the Mississippi Attorney General filed in the Chancery Court of Jackson County, Mississippi, a Notice of Violation, Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, and Request for an Accounting by Defendant Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation. In this filing, Mississippi estimated that its damages exceeded $5.0 million. A hearing on B&W's motion for summary judgment and the State's motion to enforce the settlement agreement was held on July 27, 2011.
In May 2006, the State of Florida filed a motion, in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, to enforce the Settlement Agreement, for an Accounting by Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc., and for an Order of Contempt, raising substantially the same issues as raised by the Mississippi Attorney General and seeking approximately $12.4 million in additional payments under the Florida Settlement Agreement, as well as $17.0 million in interest payments. This matter is currently in the discovery phase.
In October 2008, Vibo Corporation, Inc. d/b/a General Tobacco, referred to as General, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against RJR Tobacco and other participating manufacturers, referred to as PMs, under the MSA, and the Attorneys General of the 52 states and territories that are parties to the MSA. General sought, among other things, to enjoin enforcement of certain provisions of the MSA and an order relieving it of certain of its payment obligations under the MSA and, in the event such relief was not granted, rescission of General's 2004 agreement to join the MSA. General also moved for a preliminary injunction that, among other things, would have enjoined the states from enforcing certain of General's payment obligations under the MSA. In November 2008, RJR Tobacco and the other defendants moved to dismiss General's complaint. In January 2009, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the defendants' motions and dismissing General's lawsuit. Final judgment was entered on January 5, 2010. On January 13, 2010, General noticed its appeal of this decision. Briefing is complete. Oral argument has not been scheduled.
In December 2007, nine states (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington) sued RJR Tobacco claiming that an advertisement published in Rolling Stone magazine the prior month violated the MSA's ban on the use of cartoons. The states asserted that the magazine's content adjacent to a Camel gatefold advertisement included cartoon images prohibited by the MSA and that certain images used in the Camel ad itself were prohibited cartoons. In addition, three states (Connecticut, New York and Maryland) also claimed that a direct mail piece distributed by RJR Tobacco violated the MSA prohibition against distributing utilitarian items bearing a tobacco brand name. Each state sought injunctive relief and punitive monetary sanctions. Eight of the nine courts have since ruled that the states are not entitled to the punitive sanctions being sought. The issue has not been resolved definitively by the other court at this time.
Six of these magazine advertisement cases have been ruled upon following bench trials:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The three remaining cases  in Maryland, New York and Connecticut  were individually settled in the first quarter of 2010 for a non-material amount.
 The MSA includes an adjustment, referred to as an NPM Adjustment, that potentially reduces the annual payment obligations of RJR Tobacco and the other PMs. Certain requirements, collectively referred to as the Adjustment Requirements, must be satisfied before the NPM Adjustment for a given year is available:
NPM Adjustment.
 
 
When the Adjustment Requirements are satisfied, the MSA provides that the NPM Adjustment applies to reduce the annual payment obligation of the PMs. However, an individual settling state may avoid its share of the NPM Adjustment if it had in place and diligently enforced during the entirety of the relevant year a "Qualifying Statute" that imposes escrow obligations on NPMs that are comparable to what the NPMs would have owed if they had joined the MSA. In such event, the state's share of the NPM Adjustment is reallocated to other settling states, if any, that did not have in place and diligently enforce a Qualifying Statute.
 For 2003, the Adjustment Requirements were satisfied. As a result, in April 2006, RJR Tobacco placed approximately $647 million of its MSA payment into a disputed payments account, in accordance with a procedure established by the MSA. That amount represented RJR Tobacco's share of the 2003 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the MSA independent auditor. In March 2007, the independent auditor issued revised calculations that reduced RJR Tobacco's share of the NPM Adjustment for 2003 to approximately $615 million. As a result, in April 2007, RJR Tobacco instructed the independent auditor to release to the settling states approximately $32 million from the disputed payments account.
NPM Adjustment Claim for 2003.
Following RJR Tobacco's payment of a portion of its 2006 MSA payment into the disputed payments account, 37 of the settling states filed legal proceedings in their respective MSA courts seeking declaratory orders that they diligently enforced their Qualifying Statutes during 2003 and/or orders compelling RJR Tobacco and the other PMs that placed money in the disputed payments account to pay the disputed amounts to the settling states. In response, RJR Tobacco and other PMs, pursuant to the MSA's arbitration provisions, moved to compel arbitration of the parties' dispute concerning the 2003 NPM Adjustment, including the States' diligent enforcement claims, before a single, nationwide arbitration panel of three former federal judges. The settling states opposed these motions, arguing, among other things, that the issue of diligent enforcement must be resolved by MSA courts in each of the 52 settling states and territories.
As of June 30, 2011, 47 of the 48 courts that had addressed the question whether the dispute concerning the 2003 NPM Adjustment is arbitrable had ruled that arbitration is required under the MSA. The orders compelling arbitration in these states are now final and/or non-appealable. The Montana Supreme Court ruled that the state of Montana did not agree to arbitrate the question of whether it diligently enforced a qualifying statute.
As of January 2009, RJR Tobacco and certain other PMs entered into an Agreement Regarding Arbitration, referred to as the Arbitration Agreement, with 45 of the settling states, representing approximately 90% of the allocable share of the settling states. Pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement, signing states will have their ultimate liability (if any) with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment reduced by 20%, and RJR Tobacco and the other PMs that placed their share of the disputed 2005 NPM Adjustment (discussed below) into the disputed payments account have, without releasing or waiving any claims, authorized the release of those funds to the settling states.
Montana is one of the settling states that signed the Arbitration Agreement. Thus, notwithstanding the ruling of the Montana Supreme Court with respect to the arbitrability of the diligent enforcement issue, Montana is contractually obligated to participate with the other states in the arbitration that will address all remaining issues related to the dispute pertaining to the 2003 NPM Adjustment.
The arbitration panel contemplated by the MSA and the Arbitration Agreement has been selected and proceedings before the panel with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment Claim have begun. An initial administrative conference was held in July 2010, and subsequent proceedings have been held since then. It is anticipated that it will be 12 to 18 months before a decision on the merits with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment is reached.
 From 2006 to 2008, proceedings were initiated with respect to an NPM Adjustment for 2004, 2005 and 2006. The Adjustment Requirements were satisfied with respect to the NPM Adjustment for each of 2004, 2005 and 2006. As a result:
Other NPM Adjustment Claims.
 
 
The MSA permits PMs to retain disputed payment amounts pending resolution of the dispute. If the resolution of the dispute ultimately requires a PM to pay some or all of the disputed amount, then the amount deemed to be due includes interest calculated from the date the payment was originally due at the prime rate plus three percent.
In June 2009, RJR Tobacco, certain other PMs and the settling states entered into an agreement with respect to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 significant factor determinations. This agreement provides that the settling states will not contest that the disadvantages of the MSA were "a significant factor contributing to" the market share loss experienced by the PMs in those years. The stipulation pertaining to each of the three years will become effective in February of the year a final determination by the firm of independent economic consultants would otherwise have been expected (2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively), if the issue had been arbitrated on the merits. RJR Tobacco and the PMs will pay a total amount of $5 million into the States' Antitrust/Consumer Protection Tobacco Enforcement Fund established under Section VIII(c) of the MSA for each year covered by that agreement, with RJR Tobacco paying approximately 47% of such amounts.
Based on the payment calculations of the MSA independent auditor and the agreement described above regarding in pertinent part the 2007 and 2008 significant factor determinations, the Adjustment Requirements were satisfied with respect to the NPM Adjustments for 2007 and 2008. As a result, in April 2010, RJR Tobacco placed approximately $448 million of its 2010 MSA payment (representing its share of the 2007 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the MSA independent auditor) into the disputed payments account, and in April 2011, it placed approximately $477 million of its 2011 MSA payment (representing its share of the 2008 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the MSA independent auditor) into the disputed payments account. RJR Tobacco's 2011 payment into the disputed payments account was reduced by approximately $1.1 million to adjust for a downward revision by the independent auditor to RJR Tobacco's share of the 2007 NPM Adjustment.
The table below summarizes the information discussed above with respect to the disputed portions of RJR Tobacco's MSA payment obligations from 2003 through 2008  the years as to which the Adjustment Requirements have been met:
 
In addition to the NPM Adjustment claims described above, RJR Tobacco has filed dispute notices with respect to its 2009 and 2010 annual MSA payments relating to the NPM Adjustments potentially applicable to those years. The amount at issue for those two years is approximately $937 million.
Due to the uncertainty over the final resolution of the NPM Adjustment claims asserted by RJR Tobacco, no assurances can be made related to the amounts, if any, that will be realized or any amounts (including interest) that will be owed.
Antitrust Cases
A number of tobacco wholesalers and consumers have sued U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, in federal and state courts, alleging that cigarette manufacturers combined and conspired to set the price of cigarettes in violation of antitrust statutes and various state unfair business practices statutes. In these cases, the plaintiffs asked the court to certify the lawsuits as class actions on behalf of other persons who purchased cigarettes directly or indirectly from one or more of the defendants. As of June 30, 2011, all of the federal and state court cases on behalf of indirect purchasers had been dismissed, except for one state court case pending in Kansas.
In a case filed in February 2000, and pending in District Court, Seward County, Kansas, the court granted class certification in November 2001, in an action brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and the parent companies of the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, seeking to recover an unspecified amount in actual and punitive damages. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix or maintain the price of cigarettes sold in the United States. The parties are currently engaged in discovery. In November 2010, RJR Tobacco and B&W filed a motion for summary judgment. A decision is pending.
Smith v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc.,
Other Litigation and Developments
By purchase agreement dated May 12, 1999, referred to as the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco sold the international tobacco business to JTI. RJR and RJR Tobacco retained certain liabilities relating to the activities of Northern Brands, including those relating to a 1998 guilty plea entered in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, as well as an investigation conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, referred to as RCMP, for possible violations of Canadian law related to the activities that led to the Northern Brands guilty plea and certain conduct by Stanley Smith, a former executive of RJR-Macdonald, Inc., referred to as RJR-MI, which led to the termination of his severance agreement. Under its reading of the indemnification provisions of the 1999 Purchase Agreement, JTI requested indemnification for any damages arising out of the matters described below:
Claims for Indemnification.
 
 
 
 
Although RJR and RJR Tobacco recognize that, under certain circumstances, they may have other unresolved indemnification obligations to JTI under the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco disagree with JTI as to (1) what circumstances relating to any such matters may give rise to indemnification obligations by RJR and RJR Tobacco, and (2) the nature and extent of any such obligation. RJR and RJR Tobacco have conveyed their position to JTI, and the parties have agreed to resolve their differences at a later time. In the interim, RJR and RJR Tobacco have been paying defense costs and expenses incurred by JTI in connection with some, but not all, of the Canadian litigation matters described above. RJR Tobacco expensed $3 million during the first six months of 2011, for funds to be reimbursed to JTI for such costs and expenses.
See note 5 for additional information related to the Comprehensive Agreement entered into by RJR Tobacco with the Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments, and the plea agreement of Northern Brands in connection with certain Canadian matters.
. On October 30, 2002, the European Community and ten of its member states filed a complaint in the EDNY against RJR, RJR Tobacco and several currently and formerly related companies. The complaint contains many of the same or similar allegations found in an earlier complaint, now dismissed, filed in August 2001 and also alleges that the defendants, together with certain identified and unidentified persons, engaged in money laundering and other conduct violating civil RICO and a variety of common laws. The complaint also alleges that the defendants manufactured cigarettes that were eventually sold in Iraq in violation of U.S. sanctions. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and treble damages among other types of relief. This matter has been stayed and largely inactive since November 24, 2009 when, with the court's permission, the European Community and member states filed and served a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint added 16 member states as plaintiffs and RAI, RJR Tobacco and R. J. Reynolds Global Products Inc., referred to as GPI, as defendants. The allegations contained in the second amended complaint are in most respects either identical or similar to those found in the prior complaint, but now add new allegations primarily regarding the activities of RAI, RJR Tobacco and GPI following the B&W business combination. Pursuant to a stipulation and order, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' second amended complaint on February 15, 2010. Oral argument of the motion occurred on October 26, 2010. Supplemental briefs were then filed. Ruling on part of the defendants' motion to dismiss, on March 8, 2011, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' RICO claims, and reserved decision as to dismissal of the plaintiffs' state-law claims. Thereafter, on May 13, 2011, the court granted the remaining portion of the defendants' motion and dismissed the plaintiffs' state-law claims based on the court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 16, 2011, the clerk of court entered a judgment dismissing the action in its entirety. On June 10, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, appealing from the May 16, 2011 judgment, as well as the March 8, 2011 and May 13, 2011 orders that respectively resulted in the dismissal of their RICO and state-law claims. An appellate briefing schedule has yet to be set.
European Community
On May 23, 2001, and July 30, 2002, Star Scientific, Inc. filed two patent infringement actions, later consolidated, against RJR Tobacco in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The consolidated action, known as , involved two patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,202,649 and 6,425,401), both entitled "Method of Treating Tobacco to Reduce Nitrosamine Content, and Products Produced Thereby." Star accused RJR Tobacco of infringing certain claims of these patents during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons and asked the court to: enter an injunction restraining RJR Tobacco from further acts of infringement; award Star damages, including a reasonable royalty, to compensate for the infringement; increase the damages due to willfulness; award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and reasonable attorney fees; and order RJR Tobacco to deliver up to the court for destruction all products manufactured from any process that infringes any claim of either patent. RJR Tobacco filed counterclaims seeking a declaration that the asserted claims of Star's patents are invalid, unenforceable and not infringed by RJR Tobacco. Between January 31 and February 8, 2005, the court held a first bench trial on RJR Tobacco's affirmative defense and counterclaim based upon inequitable conduct. Additionally, in response to the court's invitation, RJR Tobacco filed two summary judgment motions in January 2005.
Star Patent Infringement.
Star I
In January 2007, the court granted RJR Tobacco's motion for summary judgment of invalidity based on indefiniteness. The court granted in part and denied in part, RJR Tobacco's other summary judgment motion concerning the effective filing date of Star's patents. In June 2007, the court ruled that Star's patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by Star and its representatives in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, referred to as the PTO, and entered final judgment in favor of RJR Tobacco and against Star. Star filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In August 2008, the Federal Circuit issued a decision reversing the district court's rulings against Star and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the issues of validity and infringement. Star updated its reasonable royalty damages calculation to a range of $294.9 to $362.1 million.
In late 2008, RJR Tobacco petitioned the PTO to reexamine the claims of Star's patents at issue in based on substantial new questions of patentability. The PTO agreed to reexamine the claims ex parte. The district court decided to move forward with the trial in rather than await the outcome of the reexamination proceedings.

Trial began on May 18, 2009, and continued for twenty trial days. On June 16, 2009, the jury returned a verdict in favor of RJR Tobacco on every question put to it. The jury decided that RJR Tobacco had not infringed either of Star's patents and that the patents were invalid on four independent bases.
Shortly after the start of the jury trial, in May 2009, Star filed a follow-on lawsuit   in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland seeking damages for alleged infringement during the 2003 growing season and beyond of the two Star patents found invalid and not infringed in . The district court stayed pending the outcome of proceedings in , and was administratively closed pending further order of the district court upon the application, by December 31, 2012, of any party.

In November 2009, RJR Tobacco filed a bill of costs (later renewed) seeking reimbursement of its recoverable costs as the prevailing party in , and also filed a motion seeking reimbursement of its attorney fees and excess costs incurred in defending . In December 2009, the district court upheld the jury verdict by denying Star's combined motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial. The court entered judgment in RJR Tobacco's favor and awarded RJR Tobacco all assessable costs. The court deferred proceedings with respect to RJR Tobacco's motion for attorneys' fees and excess costs pending final resolution of the reexamination and any appellate proceedings.

On Star's request and without objection from RJR Tobacco, the district court deferred briefing on RJR Tobacco's renewed bill of costs until after the resolution of appellate proceedings.
In December 2009, Star filed a notice of appeal in the Federal Circuit from the district court's final judgment order. The appeal was docketed in February 2010. Briefing by both parties followed, and the Federal Circuit heard oral argument on January 11, 2011. A decision on Star's appeal is pending.
In the PTO reexamination proceeding, the PTO in March and April 2011 issued ex parte reexamination certificates confirming the patentability of the claims of the Star patents at issue in . For several reasons, RJR Tobacco believes that the PTO's reexamination decision, which is not binding on the Federal Circuit, should not materially affect the Federal Circuit's review of the district court's final judgment because the jury found non-infringement in any case and invalidity in RJR Tobacco's favor on grounds not considered by the PTO.

In November, 2009, RAI and B&W were served with subpoenas issued by the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense, seeking two broad categories of documents in connection with a civil investigation:
Other Matters.
 
 
RAI and RJRT has responded to the subpoenas, including the extent to which the subpoenas seek documents regarding the domestic tobacco operations acquired from B&W in 2004, and to otherwise cooperate appropriately with the investigation.
In May 2011, RJR Tobacco and Santa Fe received separate letters from counsel to Walgreen Co. regarding a 60-Day notice served on Walgreen by a consumer group alleging violations of California's Proposition 65. The group claims that Walgreen provided or sold products with containers or wrappers containing insufficient warning in violation of California law. Walgreen believes that RJR Tobacco and Santa Fe provided the noticed products, and is requesting that RJR Tobacco and Santa Fe pay for Walgreen's defense, indemnify Walgreen and hold Walgreen harmless from all liability, loss or expense (including legal expense) related to sales of any products covered by the 60-day notice, manufactured or distributed to Walgreen by RJR Tobacco and Santa Fe. In June 2011, RJR Tobacco submitted a reply to Walgreen's counsel, and Santa Fe will submit a reply in July 2011. RJR Tobacco and Santa Fe each believes that it has valid defenses to Walgreen's claims.
Finally, in the first quarter of 2005, Commonwealth Brands, Inc., referred to as Commonwealth, was served with an individual smoking and health case, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Commonwealth requested indemnity from RJR Tobacco pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 24, 1996, between Commonwealth and B&W, referred to as the 1996 Purchase Agreement. As a result of the B&W business combination, RJR Tobacco agreed to indemnify Commonwealth for this claim to the extent, if any, required by the 1996 Purchase Agreement. The scope of the indemnity will be at issue and has not been determined.
Croft v. Akron Gasket
Smokeless Tobacco Litigation
As of June 30, 2011, American Snuff Co. was a defendant in six actions brought by individual plaintiffs in West Virginia state court seeking damages in connection with personal injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the usage of American Snuff Co.'s smokeless tobacco products. These actions are pending before the same West Virginia court as the 600 consolidated individual smoker cases against RJR Tobacco, B&W, as RJR Tobacco's indemnitee, or both. Pursuant to the court's December 3, 2001, order, the smokeless tobacco claims and defendants remain severed.
Pursuant to a second amended complaint filed in September 2006, American Snuff Co. is a defendant in , pending in the Eleventh Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The individual plaintiff alleges that he sustained personal injuries, including addiction and cancer, as a result of his use of smokeless tobacco products, allegedly including products manufactured by American Snuff Co. The plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and consequential damages in an amount greater than $15,000. There is not a punitive damages demand in this case, though the plaintiff retains the right to seek leave of court to add such a demand later. Discovery is underway.
Vassallo v. United States Tobacco Company
On September 4, 2009, American Snuff Co. and others, brought suit in the Circuit Court, Marion County, Oregon (), to enjoin the enforcement of an Oregon statute requiring smokeless tobacco manufacturers to either comply with certain requirements of the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, referred to as the STMSA, or pay into an escrow account $0.40 per unit sold in Oregon. American Snuff Co. contends the statute violates the constitutions of Oregon and the United States. In June 2010, the court denied American Snuff Co.'s motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the statute. American Snuff Co. voluntarily dismissed the case in April 25, 2011. American Snuff Co. is not escrowing money in Oregon, having provided STMSA compliance certifications to the Oregon Attorney General's office.
Conwood Company, LLC v. John Kroger
Tobacco Buyout Legislation and Related Litigation
In 2004, legislation was passed eliminating the U.S. government's tobacco production controls and price support program. The buyout of tobacco quota holders provided for in the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act, referred to as FETRA, is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer, on a market-share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied. The aggregate cost of the buyout to the industry is approximately $9.9 billion, including approximately $9.6 billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years and approximately $290 million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock. As a result of the tobacco buyout legislation, the MSA Phase II obligations established in 1999 continued as scheduled through the end of 2010, but were offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. RAI's operating subsidiaries' annual expense under FETRA for 2011 and thereafter, excluding the tobacco stock liquidation assessment, is estimated to be approximately $230 million to $260 million.
RAI's operating subsidiaries recorded the FETRA assessment on a quarterly basis as cost of goods sold. RAI's operating subsidiaries estimate that their overall share of the buyout will approximate $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the MSA. In addition, future market pricing could impact the carrying value of inventory, and adversely affect RJR Tobacco's financial position and results of operations.
As noted above, the MSA Phase II obligations are offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. Because growers in two states, Maryland and Pennsylvania, did not participate in the quota system, they are not eligible for payments under FETRA. Given that the assessments paid by tobacco product manufacturers and importers under FETRA fully offset their MSA Phase II payment obligations, the growers in Maryland and Pennsylvania would no longer receive payments under the MSA Phase II program. Thus, the growers in these two states do not receive payments under either FETRA or the MSA Phase II program.
ERISA Litigation
In May 2002, in , an employee of RJR Tobacco filed a class-action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging that the defendants, RJR, RJR Tobacco, the RJR Employee Benefits Committee and the RJR Pension Investment Committee, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, referred to as ERISA. The actions about which the plaintiff complains stem from a decision made in 1999 by RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., subsequently renamed Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., referred to as NGH, to spin off RJR, thereby separating NGH's tobacco business and food business. As part of the spin-off, the 401(k) plan for the previously related entities had to be divided into two separate plans for the now separate tobacco and food businesses. The plaintiff contends that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to participants of the RJR 401(k) plan when the defendants removed the stock funds of the companies involved in the food business, NGH and Nabisco Holdings Corp., referred to as Nabisco, as investment options from the RJR 401(k) plan approximately six months after the spin-off. The plaintiff asserts that a November 1999 amendment (the "1999 Amendment") that eliminated the NGH and Nabisco funds from the RJR 401(k) plan on January 31, 2000, contained sufficient discretion for the defendants to have retained the NGH and Nabisco funds after January 31, 2000, and that the failure to exercise such discretion was a breach of fiduciary duty. In his complaint, the plaintiff requests, among other things, that the court require the defendants to pay as damages to the RJR 401(k) plan an amount equal to the subsequent appreciation that was purportedly lost as a result of the liquidation of the NGH and Nabisco funds.
Tatum v. The R.J.R. Pension Investment Committee of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Capital Investment Plan
In July 2002, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted in December 2003. In December 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that the 1999 Amendment did contain sufficient discretion for the defendants to have retained the NGH and Nabisco funds as of February 1, 2000, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint and denied all pending motions as moot. In April 2007, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, dismissing all claims against the RJR Employee Benefits Committee and the RJR Pension Investment Committee. The remaining defendants, RJR and RJR Tobacco, filed their answer and affirmative defenses in June 2007. The plaintiff filed a motion for class certification, which the court granted in September 2008. The district court ordered mediation, but no resolution of the case was reached. In September 2008, each of the plaintiffs and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment, and in January 2009, the defendants filed a motion to decertify the class. A second mediation occurred in June 2009, but again no resolution of the case was reached. The district court overruled the motions for summary judgment and the motion to decertify the class.
A non-jury trial was held in January and February 2010. During closing arguments, the plaintiff argued for the first time that certain facts arising at trial showed that the 1999 Amendment was not validly adopted, and then moved to amend his complaint to conform to this evidence at trial. On June 1, 2011, the court granted the plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint and found that the 1999 Amendment was invalid.
The parties filed their findings of fact and conclusions of law on February 4, 2011. A decision is pending.
Environmental Matters
RAI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Such laws and regulations provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances. In the past, RJR Tobacco has been named a potentially responsible party with third parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act with respect to several superfund sites. RAI and its subsidiaries are not aware of any current environmental matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries.
In September 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, referred to as EPA, passed a rule which requires companies to monitor greenhouse gas, referred to as GHG, emissions beginning in January, 2010 and, depending upon the industry in which the particular company operates or the amount of the company's GHG emissions, report these emissions to EPA on an annual basis, beginning in 2011. Based upon its current GHG emission levels, RJR Tobacco expects that it will be necessary to submit GHG emissions reports to the EPA pertaining to one of its facilities. When necessary and appropriate, RJR Tobacco is fully prepared to submit this data annually in accordance with the EPA's regulations.
RAI and its operating subsidiaries believe that climate change is an environmental issue primarily driven by carbon dioxide emissions from the use of energy. RAI's operating subsidiaries are working to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by minimizing the use of energy where cost effective, minimizing waste to landfills and increasing recycling. Climate change is not viewed by RAI's operating subsidiaries as a significant direct economic risk to their businesses, but rather an indirect risk involving the potential for a longer term general increase in the cost of doing business. Regulatory changes are difficult to predict but the current regulatory risks to the business of RAI's operating subsidiaries with respect to climate change are relatively low and financial impacts will be driven more by the cost of natural gas and electricity. Efforts are made to mitigate the effect of increases in fuel costs directly impacting RAI's operating subsidiaries by evaluating natural gas usage and market conditions, and occasionally purchasing forward contracts, limited to a three-year period, for natural gas. In addition, RAI's operating subsidiaries are constantly evaluating electrical energy conservation measures and energy efficient equipment to mitigate impacts of increases in electrical energy costs.
Regulations promulgated by the EPA and other governmental agencies under various statutes have resulted in, and likely will continue to result in, substantial expenditures for pollution control, waste treatment, facility modification and similar activities. RAI and its subsidiaries are engaged in a continuing program to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and dependent upon the probability of occurrence and reasonable estimation of cost, accrue or disclose any material liability. Although it is difficult to reasonably estimate the portion of capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, RAI does not expect such expenditures or other costs to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries.
Other Contingencies
In connection with the sale of the international tobacco business to JTI, pursuant to the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco agreed to indemnify JTI against:
 
 
 
As described above in " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  Other Litigation and DevelopmentsCanadian Matters," RJR Tobacco has received claims for indemnification from JTI, and several of these have been resolved pursuant to the SA-MR. Although RJR and RJR Tobacco recognize that, under certain circumstances, they may have other unresolved indemnification obligations to JTI under the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco disagree what circumstances described in such claims give rise to any indemnification obligations by RJR and RJR Tobacco and the nature and extent of any such obligation. RJR and RJR Tobacco have conveyed their position to JTI, and the parties have agreed to resolve their differences at a later date.
RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and American Snuff Co. have entered into agreements to indemnify certain distributors and retailers from liability and related defense costs arising out of the sale or distribution of their products. Additionally, Santa Fe has entered into an agreement to indemnify a supplier from liability and related defense costs arising out of the sale or use of Santa Fe's products. The cost has been, and is expected to be, insignificant. RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and American Snuff Co. believe that the indemnified claims are substantially similar in nature and extent to the claims that they are already exposed to by virtue of their having manufactured those products.
Except as otherwise noted above, RAI is not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, related to these indemnification obligations.

1. . (a) Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees as a primary obligor and not merely as surety to the Guaranteed Creditors the full and prompt payment when due (whether at the stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on all Loans incurred by the Borrower and all reimbursement obligations for LC
GUARANTEE
Disbursements with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower, together with all the other obligations (including obligations which, but for the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due) and liabilities and indebtedness (including, without limitation, indemnities and fees (including any interest accruing after the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding at the rate provided for in the Credit Agreement, whether or not such interest is an allowed claim in any such proceeding)) owing by the Borrower to any Guaranteed Creditor, whether now existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of or in connection with, the Credit Agreement and the due performance and compliance by the Borrower with all of the terms, conditions and agreements contained in the Credit Agreement (all such principal, interest, liabilities, indebtedness and obligations under this clause (a) being herein collectively called the "").
Guaranteed Obligations
Each Guarantor understands, agrees and confirms that the Guaranteed Creditors may enforce this Guarantee up to the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations against such Guarantor without proceeding against any other Guarantor or the Borrower or under any other guarantee covering all or a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Guarantee is a guarantee of prompt payment and performance and not of collection.
(b) Additionally, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably, guarantees the payment of any and all Guaranteed Obligations whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the occurrence in respect of the Borrower of any of the events specified in clauses (h), (i) and (j) of Article VII of the Credit Agreement, and unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably, jointly and severally, promises to pay such Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand.
2. . The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is primary, absolute, joint and several, and unconditional and is exclusive and independent of any other guarantee of the indebtedness of the Borrower whether executed by such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever, including, without limitation: (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or any other party, (b) any other continuing or other guarantee, undertaking or maximum liability of a Guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed Obligations, (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guarantee or undertaking, (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, (e) the failure of the Guarantor to receive any benefit from or as a result of its execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee, (f) any payment made to any Guaranteed Creditor on the indebtedness which any Guaranteed Creditor repays the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, (g) any action or inaction by the Guaranteed Creditors as contemplated in Section 5 hereof or (h) any invalidity, rescission, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.
LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE
3. . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other Guarantor, any other
OBLIGATIONS OF GUARANTORS INDEPENDENT
 
guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower be joined in any such action or actions. Each Guarantor waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) the benefits of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each Guarantor.
4. . (a) Each Guarantor hereby waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and notice of the existence, creation or incurrence of any new or additional liability to which it may apply, and waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, demand for performance, protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities, suit or taking of other action by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor against, and any other notice to, any party liable thereon (including such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower) and each Guarantor further hereby waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice or proof of reliance by any Guaranteed Creditor upon this Guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended, modified, supplemented or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee.
WAIVERS BY GUARANTORS
(b) Each Guarantor waives any right to require the Guaranteed Creditors to: (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party; or (ii) pursue any other remedy in the Guaranteed Creditors' power whatsoever. Each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party other than payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, exercise any right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against the Borrower or any other party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement, contribution, indemnification or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party.
(c) Each Guarantor has knowledge and assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's and each other Guarantor's financial condition, affairs and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and has adequate means to obtain from the Borrower and each other Guarantor on an ongoing basis information relating thereto and the Borrower's and each other Guarantor's ability to pay and perform its respective Guaranteed Obligations, and agrees to assume the responsibility for keeping, and to keep, so informed for so long as this Guarantee is
 
in effect. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (x) the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no obligation to investigate the financial condition or affairs of the Borrower or any other Guarantor for the benefit of such Guarantor nor to advise such Guarantor of any fact respecting, or any change in, the financial condition, assets or affairs of the Borrower or any other Guarantor that might become known to any Guaranteed Creditor at any time, whether or not such Guaranteed Creditor knows or believes or has reason to know or believe that any such fact or change is unknown to such Guarantor, or might (or does) increase the risk of such Guarantor as guarantor hereunder, or might (or would) affect the willingness of such Guarantor to continue as a guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder and (y) the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to them regarding any of the aforementioned circumstances or risks.
(d) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that no Guaranteed Creditor nor any other Person shall be under any obligation to pursue any remedy that such Guarantor may or may not be able to pursue itself any right to which such Guarantor hereby waives.
(e) Each Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth in Section 3 and in this Section 4 is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
5. . Subject to Section 4, any Guaranteed Creditor may (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) at any time and from time to time without the consent of, or notice to, any Guarantor, without incurring responsibility to such Guarantor, without impairing or releasing the obligations or liabilities of such Guarantor hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in part:
RIGHTS OF GUARANTEED CREDITORS
(a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change, increase or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including, without limitation, any increase or decrease in the rate of interest thereon or the principal amount thereof), or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Guarantee shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, increased, accelerated, renewed or altered;
(b) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other guarantor of the Borrower or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting;
(c) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, Guarantors, other guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors;
(d) settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of the Borrower to the respective creditors of the Borrower other than the Guaranteed Creditors;
 
(e) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liabilities of the Borrower remain unpaid;
(f) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, any of the Loan Documents or any of the instruments or agreements referred to therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Loan Documents or any of such other instruments or agreements;
(g) act or fail to act in any manner which may deprive such Guarantor of its right to subrogation against the Borrower to recover full indemnity for any payments made pursuant to this Guarantee; and/or
(h) take any other action or omit to take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor from its liabilities under this Guarantee (including, without limitation, any action or omission whatsoever that might otherwise vary the risk of such Guarantor or constitute a legal or equitable defense to or discharge of the liabilities of a guarantor or surety that might otherwise limit recourse against such Guarantor).
No invalidity, illegality, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating to the Guaranteed Obligations or of any guarantee therefor shall affect, impair or be a defense to this Guarantee, and this Guarantee shall be primary, absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor except payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations.
6. . This Guarantee is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. No failure or delay on the part of any Guaranteed Creditor in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Guaranteed Creditor would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Guaranteed Creditor to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations incurred in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
CONTINUING GUARANTEE
7. . Any indebtedness of the Borrower now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors; and such indebtedness of the Borrower to any Guarantor, if the Administrative Agent, after an Event of Default has occurred
SUBORDINATION OF INDEBTEDNESS HELD BY GUARANTORS
 
and is continuing, so requests, shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guarantee. Prior to the transfer by any Guarantor of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of the Borrower to such Guarantor, such Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guarantee (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash; , that if any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the irrevocable payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and shall forthwith be paid to the Guaranteed Creditors to be credited and applied upon the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents or, if the Loan Documents do not provide for the application of such amount, to be held by the Guaranteed Creditors as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations thereafter existing.
provided
8. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Guarantee, the Guaranteed Creditors agree (by their acceptance of the benefits of this Guarantee) that this Guarantee may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders and that no other Guaranteed Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guarantee, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors upon the terms of this Guarantee. The Guaranteed Creditors further agree that this Guarantee may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee, partner, member or stockholder of any Guarantor (except to the extent such partner, member or stockholder is also a Guarantor hereunder). It is understood and agreed that the agreement in this Section 8 is among and solely for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and that, if the Required Lenders so agree (without requiring the consent of any Guarantor), this Guarantee may be directly enforced by any Guaranteed Creditor.
GUARANTEE ENFORCEABLE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
9. . In order to induce the Lenders to make Loans to, and issue Letters of Credit for the account of, the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor represents, warrants and covenants that:
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF GUARANTORS
(a) such Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required;

The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under any Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding a judgment in a Judgment Currency other than an Agreement Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Guarantors agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.
JUDGMENT CURRENCY
12. . This Guarantee shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and their successors and assigns.

14. . In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 151 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law) and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Guaranteed Creditor is hereby authorized, at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Guaranteed Creditor to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of such Guarantor to such Guaranteed Creditor under this Guarantee, irrespective of whether or not such Guaranteed Creditor shall have made any demand hereunder and although said obligations, liabilities, deposits or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. Each Guaranteed Creditor (by its acceptance of the benefits hereof) acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 14 are subject to the sharing provisions set forth in Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement.

REINSTATEMENT
17. . (a) THIS GUARANTEE AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE GUARANTEED CREDITORS AND OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS; AND WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
 
or relating to this Guarantee or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Guarantee or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Guaranteed Creditors may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Guarantee or any other Loan Document against any Guarantor or its respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(b) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in clause (a) of this Section 17. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
(c) Each party to this Guarantee irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. Nothing in this Guarantee or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party hereto or thereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
(d) EACH GUARANTOR AND EACH GUARANTEED CREDITOR (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS GUARANTEE) HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTEE, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS GUARANTEE BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17.
18. . (a) This Guarantee shall, as to each Guarantor, be released (i) if such Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement or that has been consented to in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement, (ii) if such Guarantor ceases to be a Material Subsidiary in accordance with the requirements of the definition of "Material Subsidiary" set forth in the Credit Agreement (including as a result of a designation pursuant to the second proviso appearing in the first sentence of such definition) or (iii) under the circumstances described in clause (b) below; , except in the case of preceding clause (iii), that (x) no such release
RELEASE OF LIABILITY OF GUARANTOR
provided
 
shall occur if such Guarantor continues to be a guarantor in respect of any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount equal to or greater than $50,000,000, unless and until such Subsidiary is (or is being simultaneously) released from its guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness and (y) no such release shall occur if a Default has then occurred and is continuing.
(b) At such time as the Loans and all other Obligations shall have been paid in full, the Commitments have been terminated and all Letters of Credit shall be terminated (or cash collateralized or backstopped in a manner satisfactory to each Issuing Bank), the Guarantors shall be released from their obligations under this Guarantee, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any Person.
19. . At any time a payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is made under this Guarantee, the right of contribution of each Guarantor against each other Guarantor shall be determined as provided in the immediately following sentence, with the right of contribution of each Guarantor to be revised and restated as of each date on which a payment (a "") is made on the Guaranteed Obligations under this Guarantee. At any time that a Relevant Payment is made by a Guarantor that results in the aggregate payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment exceeding such Guarantor's Contribution Percentage (as defined below) of the aggregate payments made by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment (such excess, the ""), each such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Guarantor who has made payments in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment in an aggregate amount less than such other Guarantor's Contribution Percentage of the aggregate payments made to and including the date of the Relevant Payment by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (the aggregate amount of such deficit, the "") in an amount equal to (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of such Guarantor and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of all Guarantors multiplied by (y) the Aggregate Deficit Amount of such other Guarantor. A Guarantor's right of contribution pursuant to the preceding sentences shall arise at the time of each computation, subject to adjustment to the time of each computation; that no Guarantor may take any action to enforce such right until the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash and all Commitments and all Letters of Credit have been terminated, it being expressly recognized and agreed by all parties hereto that any Guarantor's right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 19 against any other Guarantor shall be expressly junior and subordinate to such other Guarantor's obligations and liabilities in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations owing under this Guarantee. As used in this Section 19: (i) each Guarantor's "" shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the Adjusted Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor by (y) the aggregate Adjusted Net Worth of all Guarantors; (ii) the "" of each Guarantor shall mean the greater of (x) the Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor and (y) zero; and (iii) the "" of each Guarantor shall mean the amount by which the fair saleable value of such Guarantor's assets on the date of any Relevant Payment exceeds its existing debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but without giving effect to any Guaranteed Obligations arising under this Guarantee) on such date. Notwithstanding anything to the

contrary contained above, any Guarantor that is released from this Guarantee pursuant to Section 18 hereof shall thereafter have no contribution obligations, or rights, pursuant to this Section 19, and at the time of any such release, if the released Guarantor had an Aggregate Excess Amount or an Aggregate Deficit Amount, same shall be deemed reduced to $0, and the contribution rights and obligations of the remaining Guarantors shall be recalculated on the respective date of release (as otherwise provided above) based on the payments made hereunder by the remaining Guarantors. All parties hereto recognize and agree that, except for any right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 19, each Guarantor who makes any payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have no right of contribution or subrogation against any other Guarantor in respect of such payment until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash. Each of the Guarantors recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the party entitled to such contribution. In this connection, each Guarantor has the right to waive its contribution right against any Guarantor to the extent that after giving effect to such waiver such Guarantor would remain solvent, in the determination of the Required Lenders.
20. . Each Guarantor and each Guaranteed Creditor (by its acceptance of the benefits of this Guarantee) hereby confirms that it is its intention that this Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any similar Federal or state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Guarantor and each Guaranteed Creditor (by its acceptance of the benefits of this Guarantee) hereby irrevocably agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed by such Guarantor shall be limited to such amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws and after giving effect to any rights to contribution pursuant to any agreement providing for an equitable contribution among such Guarantor and the other Guarantors, result in the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
LIMITATION ON GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS
21. . This Guarantee may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
COUNTERPARTS
22. . All payments made by any Guarantor hereunder will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense and on the same basis as payments are made by the Borrower under Sections 2.15 and 2.16 of the Credit Agreement.

It is understood and agreed that any Subsidiary of the Borrower that elects to execute a counterpart of this Guarantee after the date hereof pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall become a Guarantor hereunder by executing a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and delivering same to the Administrative Agent, in each case with all documents and actions required to be taken to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent.
