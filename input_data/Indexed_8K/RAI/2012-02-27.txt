If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.

(b) . The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
(c) .

were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.16(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to any Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing in reasonable detail the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
(e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.16(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of any documentation described in Section 2.16(f)(iii) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with (if no Default then exists) the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if no Default then exists, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

Tobacco Litigation  General
Introduction
Various legal proceedings or claims, including litigation claiming that cancer and other diseases, as well as addiction, have resulted from the use of, or exposure to, RAI's operating subsidiaries' products, are pending or may be instituted against RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. or their affiliates, including RAI and RJR, or indemnitees, including B&W. These pending legal proceedings include claims relating to cigarette products manufactured by RJR Tobacco or certain of its affiliates and indemnitees, as well as claims relating to smokeless tobacco products manufactured by American Snuff Co. A discussion of the legal proceedings relating to cigarette products is set forth below under the heading " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry." All of the references under that heading to tobacco-related litigation, smoking and health litigation and other similar references are references to legal proceedings relating to cigarette products and are not references to legal proceedings involving smokeless tobacco products, and case numbers under that heading include only cases involving cigarette products. The legal proceedings relating to the smokeless tobacco products manufactured by American Snuff Co. are discussed separately under the heading " Smokeless Tobacco Litigation" below.
In connection with the B&W business combination, RJR Tobacco has agreed to indemnify B&W and its affiliates, including its indirect parent, BAT, against certain liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by B&W or its affiliates arising out of the U.S. cigarette and tobacco business of B&W. As a result of this indemnity, RJR Tobacco has assumed the defense of pending B&W-specific tobacco-related litigation, has paid the judgments and costs related to certain pre-business combination tobacco-related litigation of B&W, and has posted bonds on behalf of B&W, where necessary, in connection with cases decided since the B&W business combination. In addition, pursuant to this indemnity, RJR Tobacco expensed less than $1 million during each of 2011, 2010 and 2009 for funds to be reimbursed to BAT for costs and expenses incurred arising out of certain tobacco-related litigation.
Certain Terms and Phrases
Certain terms and phrases used in this disclosure may require some explanation. The term "judgment" or "final judgment" refers to the final decision of the court resolving the dispute and determining the rights and obligations of the parties. At the trial court level, for example, a final judgment generally is entered by the court after a jury verdict and after post-verdict motions have been decided. In most cases, the losing party can appeal a verdict only after a final judgment has been entered by the trial court.
The term "damages" refers to the amount of money sought by a plaintiff in a complaint, or awarded to a party by a jury or, in some cases, by a judge. "Compensatory damages" are awarded to compensate the prevailing party for actual losses suffered, if liability is proved. In cases in which there is a finding that a defendant has acted willfully, maliciously or fraudulently, generally based on a higher burden of proof than is required for a finding of liability for compensatory damages, a plaintiff also may be awarded "punitive damages." Although damages may be awarded at the trial court stage, a losing party generally may be protected from paying any damages until all appellate avenues have been exhausted by posting a supersedeas bond. The amount of such a bond is governed by the law of the relevant jurisdiction and generally is set at the amount of damages plus some measure of statutory interest, modified at the discretion of the appropriate court or subject to limits set by court or statute.
The term "settlement" refers to certain types of cases in which cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, have agreed to resolve disputes with certain plaintiffs without resolving the case through trial. The principal terms of certain settlements entered into by RJR Tobacco and B&W are explained below under " Accounting for Tobacco-Related Litigation Contingencies."
Theories of Recovery
The plaintiffs seek recovery on a variety of legal theories, including negligence, strict liability in tort, design defect, special duty, voluntary undertaking, breach of warranty, failure to warn, fraud, misrepresentation, unfair trade practices, conspiracy, unjust enrichment, medical monitoring, public nuisance and violations of state and federal antitrust laws. In certain of these cases, the plaintiffs claim that cigarette smoking exacerbated injuries caused by exposure to asbestos.
The plaintiffs seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, treble or multiple damages and statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, and injunctive and other equitable relief. Although alleged damages often are not determinable from a complaint, and the law governing the pleading and calculation of damages varies from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, compensatory and punitive damages have been specifically pleaded in a number of cases, sometimes in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars.
Defenses
The defenses raised by RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and their affiliates and indemnitees include, where applicable and otherwise appropriate, preemption by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of some or all claims arising after 1969, or by the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act for claims arising after 1986, the lack of any defect in the product, assumption of the risk, contributory or comparative fault, lack of proximate cause, remoteness, lack of standing and statutes of limitations or repose. RAI and RJR have asserted additional defenses, including jurisdictional defenses, in many of the cases in which they are named.
Accounting for Tobacco-Related Litigation Contingencies
In accordance with GAAP, RAI and its subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and SFNTC, as applicable, record any loss concerning litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated on an individual case-by-case basis. For the reasons set forth below, RAI's management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular pending smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against American Snuff Co., when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable, except for four Progeny cases described below.
Engle
RJR Tobacco and its affiliates believe that they have valid defenses to the smoking and health tobacco litigation claims against them, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them. RAI, RJR Tobacco and their affiliates and indemnitees have, through their counsel, filed pleadings and memoranda in pending smoking and health tobacco litigation that set forth and discuss a number of grounds and defenses that they and their counsel believe have a valid basis in law and fact. With the exception of Progeny cases, described below, RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees continue to win the majority of smoking and health tobacco litigation claims that reach trial, and a very high percentage of the tobacco-related litigation claims brought against them continue to be dismissed at or before trial. Based on their experience in the smoking and health tobacco litigation against them and the strength of the defenses available to them in such litigation, RJR Tobacco and its affiliates believe that their successful defense of smoking and health tobacco litigation in the past will continue in the future.
Engle
An accrual of $64 million has been recorded in RAI's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 for the four Progeny cases, described below, that have proceeded through the appellate process in the state of Florida. RJR Tobacco is seeking further review of these four cases by the U.S. Supreme Court. This amount includes $53 million for compensatory and punitive damages and $11 million for attorneys' fees and statutory interest through December 31, 2011. No other liabilities for pending smoking and health litigation have been recorded as of December 31, 2011.
Engle
Generally, RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees have not settled, and currently RJR Tobacco and its affiliates do not intend to settle, any smoking and health tobacco litigation claims. It is the policy of RJR Tobacco and its affiliates to vigorously defend all tobacco-related litigation claims.
The only material settlements of smoking and health tobacco litigation claims reached by RJR Tobacco and B&W involved:
 
 
The circumstances surrounding the State Settlement Agreements and the funding of a trust fund to benefit the tobacco growers are readily distinguishable from the current categories of smoking and health cases involving RJR Tobacco or its affiliates and indemnitees. The claims underlying the State Settlement Agreements were brought on behalf of the states to recover funds paid for health care and medical and other assistance to state citizens suffering from diseases and conditions allegedly related to tobacco use. The State Settlement Agreements settled all the health-care cost recovery actions brought by, or on behalf of, the settling jurisdictions and contain releases of various additional present and future claims. In accordance with the MSA, various tobacco companies agreed to fund a $5.2 billion trust fund to be used to address the possible adverse economic impact of the MSA on tobacco growers. A discussion of the State Settlement Agreements, and a table depicting the related payment schedule, is set forth below under " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases  State Settlement Agreements."
The states were a unique set of plaintiffs and are not involved in any of the smoking and health cases remaining against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates and indemnitees. Although RJR Tobacco and certain of its affiliates and indemnitees continue to be defendants in health-care cost recovery cases similar in theory to the state cases but involving other plaintiffs, such as Native American tribes and foreign governments, the vast majority of such cases have been dismissed on legal grounds. RJR Tobacco and its affiliates, including RAI, believe that the same legal principles that have resulted in dismissal of health-care cost recovery cases either at the trial court level or on appeal should compel dismissal of the similar pending cases.
As with claims that were resolved by the State Settlement Agreements, the other cases settled by RJR Tobacco can be distinguished from existing cases pending against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees. The original case, discussed below under " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  Cases," was settled in the middle of trial during negotiations concerning a possible nation-wide settlement of claims similar to those underlying the State Settlement Agreements.
Broin
Broin II
RJR Tobacco's Comprehensive Agreement with the Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments resolved all civil claims related to the movement of contraband tobacco products in Canada during the period 1985 through 1999 that the Canadian governments could assert against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates. These claims were separate from any smoking and health tobacco litigation. A discussion of the Canadian matters and the related settlement are set forth in note 6.
Likewise, RJR Tobacco and B&W separately settled the antitrust case which was brought by a unique class of plaintiffs: a class of all tobacco growers and tobacco allotment holders. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants conspired to fix the price of tobacco leaf and to destroy the federal government's tobacco quota and price support program. Despite legal defenses they believed to be valid, RJR Tobacco and B&W separately settled this case to avoid a long and contentious trial with the tobacco growers. The case and the antitrust case currently pending against RJR Tobacco and B&W involve different types of plaintiffs and different theories of recovery under the antitrust laws than the smoking and health cases pending against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees.
DeLoach v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc.,
DeLoach
Finally, as discussed under " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  State Settlement Agreements  Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments," RJR Tobacco and B&W each has settled certain cases brought by states concerning the enforcement of State Settlement Agreements. Despite legal defenses believed to be valid, these cases were settled to avoid further contentious litigation with the states involved. These enforcement actions involve alleged breaches of State Settlement Agreements based on specific actions taken by particular defendants. Accordingly, any future enforcement actions involving State Settlement Agreements will be reviewed by RJR Tobacco on the merits and should not be affected by the settlement of prior enforcement cases.
American Snuff Co. also believes that it has valid defenses to the smokeless tobacco litigation against it. American Snuff Co. asserted and will continue to assert some or all of these defenses in each case at the time and in the manner deemed appropriate by American Snuff Co. and its counsel. No verdict or judgment has been returned or entered against American Snuff Co. on any claim for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of smokeless tobacco. American Snuff Co. intends to defend vigorously all smokeless tobacco litigation claims asserted against it. No liability for pending smokeless tobacco litigation was recorded in RAI's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.
Cautionary Statement
Even though RAI's management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular pending smoking and health tobacco litigation claim (except for the four Progeny cases described below) against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular case concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against American Snuff Co., when viewed on an individual case-by-case basis, is not probable, the possibility of material losses related to such litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any particular litigation pending against RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. or their affiliates or indemnitees, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss.
Engle
Although RJR Tobacco believes that it has valid bases for appeals of adverse verdicts in its pending cases, and RJR Tobacco and RAI believe they have valid defenses to all actions, and intend to defend all actions vigorously, it is possible that there could be further adverse developments in pending cases, and that additional cases could be decided unfavorably against RAI, RJR Tobacco or their affiliates or indemnitees. Determinations of liability or adverse rulings in such cases or in similar cases involving other cigarette manufacturers as defendants, even if such judgments are not final, could have a material adverse effect on the litigation against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees and could encourage the commencement of additional tobacco-related litigation. In addition, a number of political, legislative, regulatory and other developments relating to the tobacco industry and cigarette smoking have received wide media attention. These developments may negatively affect the outcomes of tobacco-related legal actions and encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.
Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of such events on pending litigation and the rate new lawsuits are filed against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, a significant increase in litigation or in adverse outcomes for tobacco defendants, or difficulties in obtaining the bonding required to stay execution of judgments on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on any or all of these entities. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees in litigation matters, it is possible that RAI's results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending litigation matters against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees.
Similarly, smokeless tobacco litigation is subject to many uncertainties. Notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to American Snuff Co., it is possible that RAI's results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending litigation matters against American Snuff Co.
Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry
Overview
 In connection with the B&W business combination, RJR Tobacco agreed to indemnify B&W and its affiliates against, among other things, certain litigation liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by B&W or its affiliates arising out of the U.S. cigarette and tobacco business of B&W. Accordingly, the cases discussed below include cases brought solely against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates, including RAI and RJR; cases brought against both RJR Tobacco, its affiliates and B&W; and cases brought solely against B&W and assumed by RJR Tobacco in the B&W business combination.
Introduction.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, 19 tobacco-related cases, including nine Progeny cases, were served against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees. On December 31, 2011, there were 170 cases pending against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees: 159 in the United States; 10 in Canada and one in Israel, as compared with 198 total cases on December 31, 2010. The U.S. case number does not include the 577 individual smoker cases pending in West Virginia state court as a consolidated action, 6,561 Progeny cases (as hereinafter defined), involving approximately 7,852 individual plaintiffs, and 2,586 cases (as hereinafter defined), pending in the United States against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees. Of the U.S. cases pending on December 31, 2011, 18 are pending in federal court, 140 in state court, primarily in the following states: Florida (29 cases); Missouri (19 cases); New York (17 cases); Maryland (13 cases); Louisiana (12 cases); and California (11 cases).

The following table lists the categories of the U.S. tobacco-related cases pending against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees as of December 31, 2011, compared with the number of cases pending against RJR Tobacco, its affiliates or indemnitees as of September 30, 2011, as reported in RAI's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011, filed with the SEC on October 28, 2011, and a cross-reference to the discussion of each case type.
 
 
The following cases against RJR Tobacco and B&W have attracted significant attention: the Florida state court class-action case, . and the related Progeny cases, the Louisiana state court class-action case, and the case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, referred to as RICO.
Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co
Engle
Scott v. American Tobacco Co.,
In 2000, a jury in rendered a punitive damages verdict in favor of the "Florida class" of approximately $145 billion against all defendants. In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court, among other things, affirmed an appellate court's reversal of the punitive damages award, decertified the class going forward, preserved several class-wide findings from the trial, including that nicotine is addictive and cigarettes are defectively designed, and authorized class members to avail themselves of these findings in individual lawsuits under certain conditions. After subsequent motions were resolved, the Florida Supreme Court issued its mandate on January 11, 2007, thus beginning a one-year period in which former class members were permitted to file individual lawsuits. In October 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition for writ of certiorari.
Engle
Individual Progeny cases are pending in both federal and state court in Florida. As of December 31, 2011, 3,246 cases were pending in federal court, and 3,315 cases were pending in state court. These cases include approximately 7,852 plaintiffs. The number of cases will likely change due to individual plaintiffs being severed from multi-plaintiff cases and multi-plaintiff federal cases being dismissed or consolidated. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, RJR Tobacco was aware of 46 additional cases that had been filed but not served (with 319 plaintiffs). Fifty-seven trials have occurred in Florida state court since 2009, and numerous state court trials are scheduled for 2012.

As Progeny litigation has progressed, the federal and state court systems have adopted different rules to govern those cases, and both have courts issuing conflicting opinions. For example, in ., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, referred to as the Eleventh Circuit, held that the preserved findings establish only those issues "actually adjudicated" in the class trial. In other words, based on the decision in , the findings would not prevent RJR Tobacco and other defendants from raising issues and defenses that were not, or may not have been, resolved against them in .

The court further held that an Progeny plaintiff bears the burden of showing, to a "reasonable degree of certainty," that any issue the plaintiff seeks to treat as established in his favor was, in fact, actually raised and resolved in . The court held that these standards were required by Florida preclusion law, and it reserved judgment on the question of whether the same standards were also required by the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Prior to the Eleventh Circuit decision in , three federal district court judges (including the judge in ) concluded that any broader use of the preserved findings would violate both Florida preclusion law and federal due process.

The state courts in Florida, however, have taken two entirely different approaches since . In ., the First District Court of Appeal, referred to as the First DCA, held that the findings establish not only facts that were "actually adjudicated" in favor of the class in , but also all facts that could have been decided in favor of the class. The court in thus held that, "no matter the wording of the findings" in , individual Progeny plaintiffs need not "demonstrate the relevance of the findings to their lawsuits" in order to prevent litigation on otherwise contested issues of misconduct. The court in expressly disagreed with the Eleventh Circuit decision in on this point.

The Florida Supreme Court, the First DCA, and the Fourth DCA thus far have failed to address the due process argument. The First DCA in did not mention due process, despite it being one of RJR Tobacco's central contentions on appeal. Moreover, in five subsequent individual Progeny appeals, the First DCA refused to issue any opinion; instead, it affirmed the plaintiffs' verdicts by per curiam orders citing with no explanation. The First DCA and the Fourth DCA have both refused to certify the question of the proper use of the findings as one of exceptional importance warranting review by the Florida Supreme Court, even though that question affects every Progeny case and notwithstanding the explicit disagreement between the state and federal courts on this issue. Moreover, on July 19, 2011, the Florida Supreme Court refused to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to review and issued summary denial of petitions in , and which are discussed specifically below in " and Progeny Cases."

As of December 31, 2011, jury verdicts in favor of the Progeny plaintiffs had been entered against RJR Tobacco in the total amount of $54,415,500 in compensatory damages (as adjusted) and $212,530,000 in punitive damages, for a total of $266,945,500. All of these verdicts are at various stages in the appellate process, including , , and , which RJR Tobacco is seeking review by the USSC. Except for those four cases, no liability for pending smoking and health litigation related to Progeny cases was recorded in RAI's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. RJR Tobacco continues to believe that it has valid defenses in these cases, including the state preclusion law and federal due process issues that impact all Progeny cases. RJR Tobacco has petitioned the USSC to review its due process claims in the , , and cases and will do so in other cases as necessary and appropriate. Should RJR Tobacco not prevail in any particular individual Progeny case or determine that in any individual Progeny case an unfavorable outcome has become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, a loss would be recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on earnings and cash flows of RAI in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.

This recognition of Progeny cases as of December 31, 2011, is consistent with RAI's and RJR Tobacco's historic recognition related to such smoking and health litigation claims. It is the policy of RJR Tobacco and its affiliates to vigorously defend all such claims, including Progeny cases. It is also the policy of RJR Tobacco to record any loss concerning litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated on an individual case-by-case basis. Accordingly, although RJR Tobacco has petitioned the USSC for review in the , , and cases, RJR Tobacco recognized a liability for each of these cases as of December 31, 2011.

In 2004, a jury in returned a verdict in favor of the "Louisiana class" for $591 million to establish a state-wide smoking cessation program. In 2007, the Louisiana Court of Appeal upheld class certification, significantly reduced the scope of recovery, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Louisiana and U.S. Supreme Courts denied the defendants' applications for writ of certiorari. In July 2008, the trial court entered an amended judgment in favor of the class for approximately $263 million plus interest from June 30, 2004. In April 2010, the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal amended the final judgment, and as amended, affirmed the judgment. Pursuant to the judgment, the defendants were required to deposit with the court $242 million with judicial interest from July 21, 2008, until paid. In September 2010, the defendants' application for writ of certiorari with the Louisiana Supreme Court and emergency motion to stay execution of judgment in the Supreme Court of Louisiana were denied. The U.S. Supreme Court also granted the application to stay the judgment pending applicants' timely filing, and the Court's disposition, of a petition for writ of certiorari. The defendants' petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court was denied on June 27, 2011. RJR Tobacco accrued $139 million, the portion of the judgment allocated to RJR Tobacco and B&W, in the second quarter of 2011. RJR Tobacco paid the judgment in August 2011. In December 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion for assessment of attorneys' fees and costs for the prosecution of the case.

In the case, brought in 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the government sought, among other forms of relief, the disgorgement of profits pursuant to the civil provisions of RICO. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in 2005 that disgorgement is not an available remedy in the case. The bench trial ended in June 2005, and the court, in August 2006, issued its ruling, among other things, finding certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, liable for the RICO claims, imposing no direct financial penalties on the defendants, but ordering the defendants to make certain "corrective communications" in a variety of media and enjoining the defendants from using certain brand descriptors. Both sides appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In May 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals largely affirmed the findings against the tobacco company defendants and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the parties' petitions for writ of certiorari in June 2010. Post-remand proceedings are underway.

In November 1998, the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, entered into the MSA with 46 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and certain U.S. territories and possessions. These cigarette manufacturers previously settled four other cases, brought on behalf of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota, by separate agreements with each state.

RJR Tobacco records the allocation of settlement charges as products are shipped.
 Trial schedules are subject to change, and many cases are dismissed before trial. It is likely, however, that RJR Tobacco and other cigarette manufacturers will continue to face an increased number of tobacco-related trials when compared to recent years. There are seven cases, exclusive of Progeny cases, scheduled for trial as of December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2012, for RJR Tobacco or its affiliates and indemnitees: three other non-smoking and health cases, two individual smoking and health cases, one antitrust case and one class action.

Below is a description of the individual smoking and health cases against RJR Tobacco or B&W, or both, which went to trial or were decided during the period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, or remained on appeal as of December 31, 2011.
On August 15, 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favor of B&W in , a case filed in March 1999 in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. The plaintiff, Lois Eiser, sought compensatory and punitive damages in an amount in excess of $50,000, together with interest, costs and attorneys' fees in this wrongful death action against B&W. In January 2006, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the verdict. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's petition to appeal, and on December 28, 2007, remanded the case to the Superior Court for further review of certain issues. In August 2010, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania entered a memorandum affirming the final judgment. In December 2011, the plaintiff's petition for permission to appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was denied. The deadline for the plaintiff to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court is March 5, 2012.
Eiser v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.
On December 18, 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in a case filed in August 2000 in Supreme Court, Kings County, New York, awarded $350,000 in compensatory damages and eventually returned a verdict of $20 million in punitive damages against the defendants in an action brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco, who was dismissed prior to trial, and B&W. Other manufacturers were dismissed before trial. The plaintiff, Gladys Frankson, alleged that Mr. Frankson became addicted to nicotine, was unable to cease smoking, developed lung cancer and died as a result. The defendants as a group and the deceased smoker were each found to be 50% at fault. On January 9, 2004, the jury awarded $20 million in punitive damages, assigning $6 million to B&W and $2 million to American Tobacco, a predecessor company to B&W. In June 2004, the parties' post-trial motions were denied by the trial judge, except that the trial judge granted a new trial unless the parties consented to an increase in compensatory damages to $500,000 and a decrease in punitive damages to $5 million, of which $4 million would be assigned to B&W. The plaintiff stipulated to the reduction in punitive damages in January 2005. Defendants filed a notice of appeal of the orders on post-trial motions in January 2005. In July 2006, the Appellate Division, New York Supreme Court, Second Department, directed that the plaintiffs' claims for design defect be dismissed, but otherwise affirmed the orders denying defendants' post-trial motions. Following remand from this appellate decision, the plaintiff withdrew her request for additur of the compensatory damages, and in December 2006, the trial judge granted this request, and reinstated the original $350,000 compensatory damages jury verdict.
Frankson v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
On June 26, 2007, final judgment was entered against the defendants in the amount of approximately $6.8 million, including interest through the date the judgment was entered and costs. The defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division, New York Supreme Court, Second Department. Pursuant to its agreement to indemnify B&W, RJR Tobacco posted a supersedeas bond in the amount of $8.018 million. In September 2009, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmed the compensatory damages award, set aside the punitive damages award and remanded the case to the Kings County Supreme Court for a new trial on punitive damages. No date has been set for the punitive damages retrial.
On February 1, 2005, the jury returned a split verdict in a case filed in May 2003 in Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, finding in favor of B&W on two counts, fraudulent concealment and conspiracy, and finding in favor of the plaintiffs on negligence, which incorporates failure to warn and product defect claims. The plaintiff, Lincoln Smith, claimed that the defendant's tobacco products caused Mrs. Smith's death from lung cancer. The plaintiffs were awarded $2 million in compensatory damages and $20 million in punitive damages; however, the jury found the plaintiff to be 75% at fault and B&W 25% at fault, and thus the compensatory award was reduced to $500,000. B&W appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals, and in July 2007, the court affirmed the compensatory damages and ordered a new trial on punitive damages. In December 2008, the Missouri Court of Appeals issued an opinion that affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case for further proceedings on the issue of punitive damages. Trial on the issue of punitive damages began in July 2009. On July 29, 2009, RJR Tobacco, on behalf of B&W, paid the compensatory damages verdict, plus interest, in the amount of approximately $700,000. In August 2009, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, finding B&W liable for damages for aggravating circumstances, and on August 20, 2009, awarded the plaintiffs $1.5 million in punitive damages. The court denied the plaintiffs' and the defendant's post-trial motions. B&W and the plaintiffs filed notices of appeal in December 2009. Oral argument occurred on September 28, 2011. A decision is pending.

dangerous cigarette products and for economic losses she sustained as a result of unfair trade practices of the defendant. The jury found RJR Tobacco to be 58% at fault and the plaintiff to be 42% at fault, awarded $13.9 million in compensatory damages and found the plaintiff to be entitled to punitive damages. In December 2010, the court awarded the plaintiff $3.97 million in punitive damages. Final judgment was entered on December 30, 2010, in the amount of $11.95 million. The court granted the plaintiff's motion for offer of judgment interest, and awarded the plaintiff $15.8 million for the period of December 6, 1999 up to and including December 5, 2010, and approximately $4,000 per day thereafter until an amended judgment was entered. The amended judgment was entered in the amount of approximately $28.1 million on March 4, 2011. The court denied RJR Tobacco's motion for a new trial in August 2011, and RJR Tobacco filed a notice of appeal in September 2011. Briefing is underway.
On May 19, 2011, a jury returned a verdict in favor of RJR Tobacco in ., a case filed in December 2005 in the Circuit Court, Hillsborough County, Florida. The plaintiff alleged that as a result of using the defendant's products, the decedent, Debra Hargroves, suffered from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease and other smoking-related diseases and/or conditions. Final judgment was entered, and the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. At a hearing in June 2011, the court denied the plaintiff's motion. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and RJR Tobacco filed a notice of cross appeal in August 2011. Briefing is underway.

West Virginia IPIC
In West Virginia, as of December 31, 2011, 577 individual claims remain pending in a consolidated action, The defendants are Philip Morris, Lorillard and RJR Tobacco (including claims concerning The American Tobacco Company and B&W). The Case Management Order currently calls for these cases to be resolved in a two phase procedure  a common issue trial in Phase I, and, if plaintiffs prevail on one or more issues, a Phase II, consisting of individual trials of liability, medical causation, compensatory damages and punitive damages for each of the individual plaintiffs. The Phase I trial will focus on whether defendants manufactured defective products, whether their conduct was tortious and whether their conduct meets the standard for a potential award of punitive damages under West Virginia law. There will be no lump sum award of punitive damages and the Phase I jury will not be asked to set a punitive multiplier. Instead, if the jury finds that a defendant's conduct meets the punitive standard, then plaintiffs in their individual trials in Phase II will have the chance to ask Phase II juries to consider awarding punitive damages to each plaintiff on a case-by-case basis. Phase I trials were initiated twice in 2010 in Kanawha County (Charleston), resulting in mistrials in February and June 2010, due to an inability to find a sufficient number of impartial jurors from which to select a jury. The court moved the case to Ohio County (Wheeling), and the Phase I trial commenced again on October 19, 2011. The court declared a mistrial on November 8, 2011. A new trial date has not been scheduled.
In re: Tobacco Litigation Individual Personal Injury Cases.
Engle and Engle Progeny Cases
Trial began in July 1998 in a case filed in May 1994, in Circuit Court, Miami-Dade County, Florida, in which a class consisting of Florida residents, or their survivors, alleged diseases or medical conditions caused by their alleged "addiction" to cigarettes. The action was brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, seeking actual damages and punitive damages in excess of $100 billion each and the creation of a medical fund to compensate individuals for future health-care costs. In July 1999, the jury found against RJR Tobacco, B&W and the other cigarette-manufacturer defendants in the initial phase, which included common issues related to certain elements of liability, general causation and a potential award of, or entitlement to, punitive damages.
Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
On July 14, 2000, in the second phase of the trial, the jury returned a punitive damages verdict in favor of the "Florida class" of approximately $145 billion against all the defendants, with approximately $36.3 billion and $17.6 billion being assigned to RJR Tobacco and B&W, respectively.
In November 2000, the trial judge denied all post-trial motions and entered judgment. The Florida Third District Court of Appeal, referred to as Third DCA, reversed the trial court's final judgment and remanded the case to the Miami-Dade County Circuit Court with instructions to decertify the class. The class appealed, and the Florida Supreme Court accepted the case in May 2004.
In July 2006, the court affirmed the dismissal of the punitive damages award and decertified the class, on a going-forward basis. The court preserved a number of class-wide findings from Phase I of the trial, including that cigarettes can cause certain diseases, that nicotine is addictive and that defendants placed defective and unreasonably dangerous cigarettes on the market, and authorized former class members to avail themselves of those findings under certain conditions in individual lawsuits, provided they commence those lawsuits within one year of the date the court's decision became final. The court specified that the eligible plaintiffs are confined to those Florida citizen residents who suffered or died from smoking-related illnesses that "manifested" themselves on or before November 21, 1996, and that were caused by an addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine.
In August 2006, RJR Tobacco and the other defendants filed a rehearing motion arguing, among other things, that the findings from the trial were not sufficiently specific to serve as the basis for further proceedings and that the Florida Supreme Court's decision denied the defendants due process. The plaintiffs also filed a rehearing motion arguing that some smokers who became sick after November 21, 1996, and who were therefore not class members, should nevertheless have the statute of limitations tolled since they may have refrained from filing suit earlier in the mistaken belief that they were class members. In December 2006, the Florida Supreme Court withdrew its July 2006, decision and issued a revised opinion, in which it set aside the jury's findings of a conspiracy to misrepresent and clarified that the jury's finding on express warranty were preserved for use by eligible plaintiffs. The court also denied the plaintiffs' motion and confirmed that the eligible plaintiffs were limited to those individuals who developed alleged smoking-related illnesses that manifested themselves on or before November 21, 1996.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the defendants' petition for writ of certiorari and petition for rehearing with the U.S. Supreme Court were both denied.
Pursuant to the Florida Supreme Court's July 2006, ruling in which decertified the class, eligible plaintiffs had one year from January 11, 2007, in which to file individual lawsuits. In addition, some individuals who filed suit prior to January 11, 2007, and who claimed they meet the conditions in also attempted to avail themselves of the ruling. Lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the ruling, whether filed before or after the January 11, 2007, mandate, are referred to as the Progeny cases. As of December 31, 2011, RJR Tobacco had been served in 6,561 Progeny cases in both state and federal courts in Florida. These cases include approximately 7,852 plaintiffs. The number of cases will likely change due to individual plaintiffs being severed from multi-plaintiff cases. Many of these cases are in active discovery or nearing trial.

Three federal district courts ruled that the findings in the first phase of the proceedings cannot be used to satisfy elements of plaintiffs' claims, and two of those rulings, in . and ., were certified by the trial court for interlocutory review. In July 2010, the Eleventh Circuit held, as a matter of Florida law, that the findings from the first phase of the proceedings cannot be given greater effect than what the jury found. Because it rejected plaintiffs' approach on state-law grounds, the court did not find it necessary to consider whether that approach would violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

judgments in effect at a given time, but never exceeds $5 million per case. The legislation, which became effective in June 2009 and 2011, applies to judgments entered after the original 2009 effective date. The plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap in four of the cases discussed below. The Alachua County court upheld the bond cap in three of those cases, and the Escambia County court upheld the bond cap in the fourth case. The First DCA affirmed the trial court's decision in all four cases. The First DCA issued a written opinion in , on July 12, 2011, explaining why the statute is constitutional. The court also stated that the issues are likely to continue until they are definitively resolved by the Florida Supreme Court. As a result, the court certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of whether the bond cap violates the Florida Constitution by limiting the amount of the bond necessary to obtain an automatic stay of the judgment against a signatory to the tobacco settlement agreement with the State of Florida. On January 23, 2012, the Florida Supreme Court decided to accept jurisdiction over the issue. Briefing is underway.

Larkin v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co
Broin II Cases
RJR Tobacco, B&W and other cigarette manufacturer defendants settled in October 1997. This case had been brought in Florida state court on behalf of flight attendants alleged to have suffered from diseases or ailments caused by exposure to ETS in airplane cabins. The settlement agreement required the participating tobacco companies to pay a total of $300 million in three annual $100 million installments, allocated among the companies by market share, to fund research on the early detection and cure of diseases associated with tobacco smoke. It also required those companies to pay a total of $49 million for the plaintiffs' counsel's fees and expenses. RJR Tobacco's portion of these payments was approximately $86 million; B&W's portion of these payments was approximately $57 million. The settlement agreement bars class members from bringing aggregate claims or obtaining punitive damages and also bars individual claims to the extent that they are based on fraud, misrepresentation, conspiracy to commit fraud or misrepresentation, RICO, suppression, concealment or any other alleged intentional or willful conduct. The defendants agreed that, in any individual case brought by a class member, the defendant will bear the burden of proof with respect to whether ETS can cause certain specifically enumerated diseases, referred to as "general causation." With respect to all other issues relating to liability, including whether an individual plaintiff's disease was caused by his or her exposure to ETS in airplane cabins, referred to as "specific causation," the individual plaintiff will have the burden of proof. On September 7, 1999, the Florida Supreme Court approved the settlement. The cases arose out of the settlement of this case.
Broin v. Philip Morris, Inc.
Broin II
On October 5, 2000, the court entered an order applicable to all cases that the terms of the settlement agreement do not require the individual plaintiffs to prove the elements of strict liability, breach of warranty or negligence. Under this order, there is a rebuttable presumption in the plaintiffs' favor on those elements, and the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that their alleged adverse health effects actually were caused by exposure to ETS in airplane cabins, that is, specific causation.

Class-Action Suits
 As of December 31, 2011, 13 class-action cases, exclusive of one antitrust class action, were pending in the United States against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees. In 1996, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in overturned the certification of a nation-wide class of persons whose claims related to alleged addiction to tobacco products. Since this ruling by the Fifth Circuit, most class-action suits have sought certification of state-wide, rather than nation-wide, classes. Class-action suits based on claims similar to those asserted in or claims that class members are at a greater risk of injury or injured by the use of tobacco or exposure to ETS are pending against RJR Tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees in state or federal courts in California, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, West Virginia and Arizona. All pending class-action cases are discussed below.
Overview.
Castano v. American Tobacco Co.
Castano
The pending class actions against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees include eight cases alleging that the use of the term "lights" constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices under state law or violates the federal RICO statute. Such suits are pending in state or federal courts in Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, California and Arizona and are discussed below under " Lights' Cases."
Finally, certain third-party payers have filed health-care cost recovery actions in the form of class actions. These cases are discussed below under " Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases."
Few smoker class-action complaints have been certified or, if certified, have survived on appeal. Eighteen federal courts, including two courts of appeals, and most state courts that have considered the issue have rejected class certification in such cases. Apart from the case discussed above, only two smoker class actions have been certified by a federal court  and , discussed below under " Lights' Cases" both of which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and ultimately decertified.

In re Simon (II) Litigation,
Schwab [McLaughlin] v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.
,
 On November 5, 1998, in a case filed in District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, the trial court certified a medical monitoring or smoking cessation class of Louisiana residents who were smokers on or before May 24, 1996. The case was brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, seeking to recover an unspecified amount of damages to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs. In July 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs' claim for medical monitoring and found that cigarettes were not defectively designed. However, the jury also made certain findings against the defendants on claims relating to fraud, conspiracy, marketing to minors and smoking cessation. Notwithstanding these findings, this portion of the trial did not determine liability as to any class member or class representative. What primarily remained in the case was a class-wide claim that the defendants pay for a program to help people stop smoking.
Medical Monitoring and Smoking Cessation Case.
Scott v. American Tobacco Co.,
In May 2004, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $591 million on the class's claim for a smoking cessation program. In September 2004, the defendants posted a $50 million bond, pursuant to legislation that limits the amount of the bond to $50 million collectively for MSA signatories, and noticed their appeal. RJR Tobacco posted $25 million (the portions for RJR Tobacco and B&W) towards the bond. In February 2007, the Louisiana Court of Appeals upheld the class certification and found the defendants responsible for funding smoking cessation for eligible class members. The appellate court also ruled, however, that the defendants were not liable for any post-1988 claims, rejected the award of prejudgment interest, struck eight of the 12 components of the smoking cessation program and remanded the case for further proceedings. In particular, the appellate court ruled that no class member, who began smoking after September 1, 1988, could receive any relief, and that only those smokers, whose claims accrued on or before September 1, 1988, would be eligible for the smoking cessation program. The plaintiffs had previously expressly represented to the trial court that none of their claims accrued before 1988 and that the class claims did not accrue until around 1996, when the case was filed. The defendants' application for writ of certiorari with the Louisiana Supreme Court was denied in January 2008. The defendants' petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in June 2008. In July 2008, the trial court entered an amended judgment in the case, finding that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for funding the cost of a court-supervised smoking cessation program and ordered the defendants to deposit approximately $263 million together with interest from June 30, 2004, into a trust for the funding of the program. The court also stated that it would favorably consider a motion to return to defendants a portion of unused funds at the close of each program year in the event the monies allocated for the preceding program year were not fully expended because of a reduction in class size or underutilization by the remaining plaintiffs.
In December 2008, the trial court judge signed an order granting the defendants an appeal from the amended judgment. In April 2010, the court of appeals amended but largely affirmed the trial court's July 2008 judgment and ordered the defendants to deposit with the court $242 million with judicial interest from July 21, 2008, until paid. The defendants' motion for rehearing was denied. In September 2010, the defendants' application for writ of certiorari or review and their emergency motion to stay execution of judgment with the Louisiana Supreme Court were denied. In September 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendant's motion to stay the judgment pending applicants' timely filing, and the Court's disposition, of a petition for writ of certiorari. The defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2010. The court denied the petition on June 27, 2011. RJR Tobacco accrued $139 million, the portions of the judgment allocated to RJR Tobacco and B&W, in the second quarter of 2011. RJR Tobacco paid the judgment in August 2011.
In December 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion for assessment of attorneys' fees and costs for the prosecution of the case. Briefing is underway. On January 6, 2012, the defendants filed exceptions and a motion to strike. A hearing on the defendants' exceptions and a motion to strike occurred on February 3, 2012. A hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for fees and costs is scheduled for June 18, 2012.
. On April 11, 2001, in a case filed in June 1997 in Superior Court, San Diego County, California, the court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for certification of a class composed of residents of California who smoked at least one of the defendants' cigarettes from June 10, 1993 through April 23, 2001, and who were exposed to the defendants' marketing and advertising activities in California. The action was brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, seeking to recover restitution, disgorgement of profits and other equitable relief under California Business and Professions Code  17200 et seq. and  17500 et seq. However, the underlying substantive claims have been reduced to include primarily allegations regarding the use of the descriptor "lights" and statements made during the class period about the health risks of cigarettes. Certification was granted as to the plaintiffs' claims that the defendants violated  17200 of the California Business and Professions Code pertaining to unfair competition. The court, however, refused to certify the class under the California Legal Remedies Act and on the plaintiffs' common law claims. In March 2005, the court granted the defendants' motion to decertify the class, and in September 2006, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the order decertifying the class. In November 2006, the plaintiffs' petition for review with the California Supreme Court was granted, and in May 2009, the court reversed the decision of the trial court, and the California Court of Appeal that decertified the class and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. In March 2010, the trial court found that the plaintiffs' "lights" claims were not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and denied the defendants' second motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a tenth amended complaint in September 2010. RJR Tobacco and B&W filed their answers to the complaint. Subsequently, on February 24, 2011, the court found that the named class representatives were not adequate, were not typical, and lacked standing. The plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration was denied. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint by adding new class representatives and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed an eleventh amended complaint adding new class representatives in July 2011. Trial is scheduled for October 5, 2012. The defendants have filed motions challenging the standing of the newly named class representatives and to decertify the case. A hearing is scheduled for March 21, 2012.
California Business and Professions Code Cases
Brown v. American Tobacco Co., Inc.,
In a class action filed in November 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the plaintiffs brought the case on behalf of all persons who tried unsuccessfully to redeem Camel Cash certificates from 1991 through March 31, 2007, or who held Camel Cash certificates as of March 31, 2007. The plaintiffs allege that in response to the defendants' action to discontinue redemption of Camel Cash as of March 31, 2007, customers, like the plaintiffs, attempted to exchange their Camel Cash for merchandise and that the defendants, however, did not have any merchandise to exchange for Camel Cash. The plaintiffs allege unfair business practices, deceptive practices, breach of contract and promissory estoppel. The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, actual damages, costs and expenses. In January 2010, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which prompted the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in February 2010. The class definition changed to a class consisting of all persons who reside in the U.S. and tried unsuccessfully to redeem Camel Cash certificates, from October 1, 2006 (six months before the defendant ended the Camel Cash program) or who held Camel Cash
Sateriale v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
certificates as of March 31, 2007. The plaintiffs also brought the class on behalf of a proposed California subclass, consisting of all California residents meeting the same criteria. In May 2010, RJR Tobacco's motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction over subject matter and, alternatively, for failure to state a claim was granted with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. In July 2010, RJR Tobacco's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was granted with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, and RJR Tobacco filed a motion to dismiss it in September 2010. In December 2010, the court granted RJR Tobacco's motion to dismiss with prejudice. Final judgment was entered by the court and the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in January 2011. Briefing is complete. Oral argument has not been scheduled.
 As noted above, "lights" class-action cases are pending against RJR Tobacco or B&W in Illinois (2), Missouri (2), Minnesota (2), California (1) and Arizona (1). The classes in these cases generally seek to recover $50,000 to $75,000 per class member for compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and other forms of relief, and attorneys' fees and costs from RJR Tobacco and/or B&W. In general, the plaintiffs allege that RJR Tobacco or B&W made false and misleading claims that "lights" cigarettes were lower in tar and nicotine and/or were less hazardous or less mutagenic than other cigarettes. The cases typically are filed pursuant to state consumer protection and related statutes.
"Lights" Cases.
Many of these "lights" cases were stayed pending review of the . case by the U.S. Supreme Court. In that "lights" class-action case pending against Altria Group, Inc. and Philip Morris USA, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that these claims are not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act or by the Federal Trade Commission's, referred to as FTC, historic regulation of the industry. Since this decision in December 2008, a number of the stayed cases have become active again.
Good v. Altria Group, Inc
The seminal "lights" class-action case involves RJR Tobacco's competitor, Philip Morris, Inc. Trial began in . in January 2003. In March 2003, the trial judge entered judgment against Philip Morris in the amount of $7.1 billion in compensatory damages and $3 billion in punitive damages to the State of Illinois. Based on Illinois law, the bond required to stay execution of the judgment was set initially at $12 billion. Philip Morris pursued various avenues of relief from the $12 billion bond requirement. On December 15, 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and sent the case back to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the case. On December 5, 2006, the trial court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss and for entry of final judgment. The case was dismissed with prejudice the same day. In December 2008, the plaintiffs filed a petition for relief from judgment, stating that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in . rejected the basis for the reversal. The trial court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition for relief from judgment in February 2009. In March 2009, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court, Fifth Judicial District, requesting a reversal of the February 2009 order and remand to the circuit court. On February 24, 2011, the appellate court entered an order, concluding that the two-year time limit for filing a petition for relief from a final judgment began to run when the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs' lawsuit on December 18, 2006. The appellate court therefore found that the petition was timely, reversed the order of the trial court, and remanded the case for further proceedings. Philip Morris filed a petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. On September 28, 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court denied Philip Morris' petition for leave to appeal and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings.

Dahl
Curtis v. Altria Group, Inc.
In a case filed in June 1998, and pending in Circuit Court, Cook County, Illinois, the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification in December 2001, in an action brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W. The case was brought on behalf of persons who have allegedly been injured by (1) the defendants' purported conspiracy pursuant to which defendants concealed material facts regarding the addictive nature of nicotine, (2) the defendants' alleged acts of targeting their advertising and marketing to minors, and (3) the defendants' claimed breach of the public right to defendants' compliance with the laws prohibiting the distribution of cigarettes to minors. The plaintiffs requested that the defendants be required to disgorge all profits unjustly received through their sale of cigarettes to plaintiffs and the class, which in no event will be greater than $75,000 per each class member, inclusive of punitive damages, interest and costs. In March 2006, the court dismissed count V, public nuisance, and count VI, unjust enrichment. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in March 2009, to add a claim of unjust enrichment and, to include in the class, individuals who smoked "light" cigarettes. RJR Tobacco and B&W answered the amended complaint in March 2009. In July 2009, the plaintiffs filed an additional motion for class certification. In September 2009, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the pleadings concerning the "lights" claims as to all defendants other than Philip Morris. In February 2010, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification of all three putative classes. However, the court ruled that the plaintiffs may reinstate the class dealing with the conspiracy to conceal the addictive nature of nicotine if they identify a new class representative. In April 2010, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to file a fourth amended complaint and withdraw the motion to reinstate count I by identifying a

As referred to in the " in the event RJR Tobacco and its affiliates or indemnitees lose one or more of the pending "lights" class-action suits, RJR Tobacco could face bonding difficulties depending upon the amount of damages ordered, if any, which could have a material adverse effect on RJR Tobacco's, and consequently RAI's, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Cautionary Statements,"
Ina case filed in November 1997 in Circuit Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, the plaintiffs brought an ETS class action against U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and parent companies of U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, on behalf of all residents of Louisiana who, though not themselves cigarette smokers, have been exposed to secondhand smoke from cigarettes which were manufactured by the defendants, and who allegedly suffered injury as a result of that exposure. The plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. In October 2004, the trial court stayed this case pending the outcome of the appeal in ., discussed above under Medical Monitoring and Smoking Cessation Case
Other Class Actions.
Young v. American Tobacco Co., Inc.,
Scott v. American Tobacco Co., Inc
" 
."
a case filed in February 1998 in Circuit Court, Ohio County, West Virginia, the plaintiff sued asbestos manufacturers, U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and parent companies of U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, seeking to recover $1 million in compensatory and punitive damages individually and an unspecified amount for the class in both compensatory and punitive damages. The class was brought on behalf of persons who allegedly have personal injury claims arising from their exposure to respirable asbestos fibers and cigarette smoke. The plaintiffs allege that Mrs. Parsons' use of tobacco products and exposure to asbestos products caused her to develop lung cancer and to become addicted to tobacco. In December 2000, three defendants, Nitral Liquidators, Inc., Desseaux Corporation of North American and Armstrong World Industries, filed bankruptcy petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Pursuant to section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, is automatically stayed with respect to all defendants.

Finally, in a case filed in December 1998 in Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, the defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri in February 1999. The action was brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and parent companies of U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, by tobacco product users and purchasers on behalf of all similarly situated Missouri consumers. The plaintiffs allege that their use of the defendants' tobacco products has caused them to become addicted to nicotine. The plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. The case was remanded to the Circuit Court in February 1999. There has been limited activity in this case.
Jones v. American Tobacco Co., Inc.,
Health-Care Cost Recovery Cases
Health-care cost recovery cases have been brought by a variety of plaintiffs. Other than certain governmental actions, these cases largely have been unsuccessful on remoteness grounds, which means that one who pays an injured person's medical expenses is legally too remote to maintain an action against the person allegedly responsible for the injury.
As of December 31, 2011, three health-care cost recovery cases were pending in the United States against RJR Tobacco, B&W, as its indemnitee, or both, as discussed below after the discussion of the State Settlement Agreements. A limited number of claimants have filed suit against RJR Tobacco, its current or former affiliates, B&W and other tobacco industry defendants to recover funds for health care, medical and other assistance paid by foreign provincial governments in treating their citizens. For more information on these cases, see " International Cases" below.
 In June 1994, the Mississippi Attorney General brought an action, , against various industry members, including RJR Tobacco and B&W. This case was brought on behalf of the state to recover state funds paid for health care and other assistance to state citizens suffering from diseases and conditions allegedly related to tobacco use. Most other states, through their attorneys general or other state agencies, sued RJR Tobacco, B&W and other U.S. cigarette manufacturers based on similar theories. The cigarette manufacturer defendants, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, settled the first four of these cases scheduled for trial  Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota  by separate agreements with each such state.
State Settlement Agreements.
Moore v. American Tobacco Co.
On November 23, 1998, the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, entered into the Master Settlement Agreement with attorneys general representing the remaining 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Marianas. Effective on November 12, 1999, the MSA settled all the health-care cost recovery actions brought by, or on behalf of, the settling jurisdictions and released various additional present and future claims.
In the settling jurisdictions, the MSA released RJR Tobacco, B&W, and their affiliates and indemnitees, including RAI, from:
 
 
Set forth below are tables depicting the unadjusted tobacco industry settlement payment schedule and the settlement payment schedule for RAI's operating subsidiaries under the State Settlement Agreements, and related information for 2009 and beyond:
 
 
 
The State Settlement Agreements also contain provisions restricting the marketing of tobacco products. Among these provisions are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of cartoon characters, brand-name sponsorships, apparel and other merchandise, outdoor and transit advertising, payments for product placement, free sampling and lobbying. Furthermore, the State Settlement Agreements required the dissolution of three industry-sponsored research and trade organizations.
The State Settlement Agreements have materially adversely affected RJR Tobacco's shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobacco's share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the State Settlement Agreements.
 On September 22, 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an action against RJR Tobacco, B&W and other tobacco companies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The government initially sought to recover federal funds expended by the federal government in providing health care to smokers who developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-related, based on several federal statutes. In addition, the government sought, pursuant to the civil provisions of RICO, disgorgement of profits the government contends were earned as a consequence of a RICO racketeering "enterprise." In September 2000, the court dismissed the government's claims asserted under the Medical Care Recovery Act as well as those under the Medicare Secondary Payer provisions of the Social Security Act, but did not dismiss the RICO claims. In February 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that disgorgement is not an available remedy in this case. The government's petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in October 2005. The non-jury, bench trial began in September 2004, and closing arguments concluded in June 2005.
Department of Justice Case.
On August 17, 2006, the court found certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, liable for the RICO claims, but did not impose any direct financial penalties. The court instead enjoined the defendants from committing future racketeering acts, participating in certain trade organizations, making misrepresentations concerning smoking and health and youth marketing, and using certain brand descriptors such as "low tar," "light," "ultra light," "mild" and "natural." The court also ordered defendants to issue "corrective communications" on five subjects, including smoking and health and addiction, and to comply with further undertakings, including maintaining web sites of historical corporate documents and disseminating certain marketing information on a confidential basis to the government. In addition, the court placed restrictions on the ability of the defendants to dispose of certain assets for use in the United States, unless the transferee agrees to abide by the terms of the court's order, and ordered the defendants to reimburse the U.S. Department of Justice its taxable costs incurred in connection with the case.
Certain defendants, including RJR Tobacco, filed notices of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in September 2006. The government filed its notice of appeal in October 2006. In addition, the defendants, including RJR Tobacco, filed joint motions asking the district court to clarify and to stay its order pending the defendants' appeal. On September 28, 2006, the district court denied the defendants' motion to stay. On September 29, 2006, the defendants, including RJR Tobacco, filed a motion asking the court of appeals to stay the district court's order pending the defendants' appeal. The court granted the motion in October 2006.
In November 2006, the court of appeals stayed the appeals pending the trial court's ruling on the defendants' motion for clarification. The defendants' motion was granted in part and denied in part. The defendants' motion as
to the meaning and applicability of the general injunctive relief of the August 2006 order was denied. The request for clarification as to the scope of the provisions in the order prohibiting the use of descriptors and requiring corrective statements at retail point of sale was granted. The court also ruled that the provisions prohibiting the use of express or implied health messages or descriptors do apply to the actions of the defendants taken outside of the United States.
In May 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals largely affirmed the finding of liability against the tobacco defendants and remanded to the trial court for dismissal of the trade organizations. The court also largely affirmed the remedial order, including the denial of additional remedies, but vacated the order and remanded for further proceedings as to the following four discrete issues:
 
 
 
 
RJR Tobacco and the other defendants, as well as the Department of Justice, filed petitions for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2010. In June 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the parties' petitions for writ of certiorari. Post-remand proceedings are underway to determine the extent to which the original order will be implemented. The defendants filed a motion to vacatur, in which they moved to vacate the trial court's injunctions and factual findings and dismiss the case in its entirety, on March 3, 2011. The court denied the motion on June 1, 2011. The defendants have filed a notice of appeal. Oral argument is scheduled for April 20, 2012. The trial court also issued an opinion on January 26, 2012, stating that it will not defer its decision on the corrective action statements pending the outcome of pending FDA litigation. In addition, the parties to the lawsuit entered into an agreement concerning certain technical obligations regarding their public websites. Pursuant to this agreement, RJR Tobacco agreed to deposit $3.125 million over the next three years into the registry of the district court.
 Five health-care reimbursement cases are pending against RJR Tobacco, its current or former affiliates, or B&W outside the United States, one in Israel and four in Canada. All of the remaining Canadian provinces have indicated an intention to file similar cases. In these actions, foreign governments are seeking to recover for health care, medical and other assistance paid in treating their citizens for tobacco-related disease. No such actions are pending in the United States. Pursuant to the terms of the 1999 sale of RJR Tobacco's international tobacco business, RJR Tobacco has tendered the defense of these actions to JTI. Subject to a reservation of rights, JTI has assumed the defense of RJR Tobacco and its current or former affiliates in these actions.
International Cases.
 
 
 
 
 
The following six putative Canadian class actions were filed against various Canadian and non-Canadian tobacco-related entities, including RJR Tobacco and one of its affiliates, in courts in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan, although the plaintiffs' counsel have been actively pursuing only the action pending in Saskatchewan at this time:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In each of these six cases, the plaintiffs allege fraud, fraudulent concealment, breach of warranty, breach of warranty of merchantability and of fitness for a particular purpose, failure to warn, design defects, negligence, breach of a "special duty" to children and adolescents, conspiracy, concert of action, unjust enrichment, market share liability, joint liability, and violations of various trade practices and competition statutes. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and aggravated damages; punitive or exemplary damages; the right to waive the torts described above and claim disgorgement of the amount of revenues or profits the defendants received from the sale of tobacco products to putative class members; interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act and other similar legislation;
and other relief the court deems just. Pursuant to the terms of the 1999 sale of RJR Tobacco's international tobacco business, RJR Tobacco has tendered the defense of these six actions to JTI. Subject to a reservation of rights, JTI has assumed the defense of RJR Tobacco and its current or former affiliates in these actions.
 As of December 31, 2011, one Native American tribe case was pending before a tribal court against RJR Tobacco and B&W, a case filed in September 1997 in Tribal Court, Crow Creek Sioux, South Dakota. The plaintiffs seek to recover actual and punitive damages, restitution, funding of a clinical cessation program, funding of a corrective public education program, and disgorgement of unjust profits from sales to minors. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants are liable under the following theories: unlawful marketing and targeting of minors, contributing to the delinquency of minors, unfair and deceptive acts or practices, unreasonable restraint of trade and unfair method of competition, negligence, negligence per se, conspiracy and restitution of unjust enrichment. The case is dormant.

Crow Creek Sioux Tribe v. American Tobacco Co.,
Other Cases
In August 2009, RJR Tobacco and American Snuff Co. joined other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer in filing a lawsuit, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentuckychallenging certain provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, referred to as the FDA Tobacco Act, that severely restricts the few remaining channels available to communicate with adult tobacco consumers. RAI believes these provisions cannot be justified on any basis consistent with the demands of the First Amendment. The suit does not challenge the U.S. Congress's decision to give the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products, nor does it challenge the vast majority of the provisions of the new law. In November 2009, the court denied certain plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction as to the modified risk tobacco products provision of the FDA Tobacco Act. The parties finished briefing their respective cross-motions for summary judgment in December 2009, and in January 2010, the court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs so as to allow the continued use of color and imagery in labeling and advertising and the right to make statements that their products conform to FDA regulatory requirements. The court granted summary judgment to the U.S. Government as to all other challenged provisions. In March 2010, each side filed a notice of appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral argument occurred July 27, 2011. A decision is pending.
Commonwealth Brands, Inc. v. United States of America,
,
On February 25, 2011, RJR Tobacco, Lorillard, Inc., and Lorillard Tobacco Company jointly filed a lawsuit, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the composition of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, referred to as the TPSAC, which had been established by the FDA. The complaint alleges that certain members of the TPSAC and certain members of its Constituents Subcommittee have financial and appearance conflicts of interest that are disqualifying under federal ethics law and regulations, and that the TPSAC is not "fairly balanced," as required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, referred to as FACA. In March 2011, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added an additional claim, based on a nonpublic meeting of members of the TPSAC, in violation of the FACA. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss in April 2011. A hearing date has not been scheduled. The court granted the plaintiffs' unopposed motion to file a second amended complaint adding a count addressing the FDA's refusal to produce all documents generated by the TPSAC and its subcommittee in preparation of the menthol report. The FDA filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for February 14, 2012.
Lorillard, Inc. v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
On August 16, 2011, RJR Tobacco and SFNTC joined other tobacco manufacturers in a lawsuit, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the final regulation specifying nine new graphic "warnings" pursuant to the FDA Tobacco Act violates the plaintiffs' rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act, referred to as the APA. The court heard oral argument on the motion for preliminary injunction on September 21, 2011. On November 7, 2011, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, which stays the imposition of the graphic warning rule for 15 months following a final ruling from the district court as to the merits of the parties claims. On December 1, 2011, the government appealed the district court's preliminary injunction ruling to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The appellate court has scheduled oral argument on the appeal for April 10, 2012. Concurrently, briefing is complete on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment that are before the district court. Oral argument on the summary judgment motions occurred on February 1, 2012. The court stated that it would issue its ruling well before the April 10, 2012 appellate hearing.
R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
For a detailed description of the FDA Tobacco Act, see " Governmental Activity" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in Item 7.
Finally, RJR Tobacco and others brought suit against the City of Worcester, Massachusetts to enjoin enforcement of an ordinance prohibiting all outdoor advertising of tobacco products and any indoor advertising that is visible from the street. The suit, , was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central Division of Massachusetts on June 17, 2011. The plaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunction and summary judgment were heard on November 9, 2011, and the parties await a ruling. Enforcement of the ordinance has been stayed by agreement pending the ruling on the motion for a preliminary injunction.
National Association of Tobacco Outlets, Inc. v. City of Worcester
State Settlement Agreements-Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments
As of December 31, 2011, there were 32 cases concerning the enforcement, validity or interpretation of the State Settlement Agreements in which RJR Tobacco or B&W is a party. This number includes those cases, discussed below, relating to disputed payments under the State Settlement Agreements.
The Vermont Attorney General filed suit in July 2005, in the Vermont Superior Court, Chittenden County, alleging that certain advertising for the Eclipse cigarette brand violated both the MSA and the Vermont Consumer Fraud Statute. The State of Vermont is seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. The bench trial in this action began on October 6, 2008, and lasted a total of five weeks. Closing arguments occurred on March 11, 2009. On March 10, 2010, the court issued its opinion, finding that three of the advertising claims made by RJR Tobacco were not supported by the appropriate degree of scientific evidence. The court did, however, rule that the remaining six advertising claims challenged by the State of Vermont were not actionable. The court indicated that remedies and any damages to be awarded, as well as the issue of attorney's fees and litigation expenses, will be addressed in additional proceedings. On March 22, 2010, RJR Tobacco filed a motion to amend findings of fact that it believes are demonstrably contrary to, or unsupported by, the record. On December 14, 2010, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part RJR Tobacco's motion. The parties will conduct a mediation on the remaining issues on February 14, 2012.
In April 2005, the Mississippi Attorney General notified B&W of its intent to seek approximately $3.9 million in additional payments under the Mississippi Settlement Agreement. The Mississippi Attorney General asserts that B&W failed to report in its net operating profit or its shipments, cigarettes manufactured by B&W under contract for Star Tobacco or its parent, Star Scientific, Inc. B&W advised the state that it did not owe the state any money. In August 2005, the Mississippi Attorney General filed in the Chancery Court of Jackson County, Mississippi, a Notice of Violation, Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, and Request for an Accounting by Defendant Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation. In this filing, Mississippi estimated that its damages exceeded $5.0 million. On August 24, 2011, the court entered an order finding in favor of the State on the Star contract manufacturing issue, that the total amount of the underpayment from B&W was approximately $3.8 million and that interest on the underpayment was approximately $4.3 million. The court appointed a special master to undertake an accounting of the benefit received by B&W for failure to include its profits from Star contract manufacturing in its net operating profits reported to the State. Finally, the court awarded the State attorneys' fees and costs in an amount to be determined. B&W filed a motion to certify the Star contract issue for interlocutory appeal, pursuant to Rule 54 (b) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. On January 9, 2012, that motion was denied.
In addition, in February 2010, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a motion alleging that RJR Tobacco had improperly failed to report shipments of certain categories of cigarette volumes, and for certain years had improperly reported its net operating profit. As a result, the State alleges that settlement payments to it were improperly reduced. RJR Tobacco disputes these allegations and is vigorously defending against them. Briefing with respect to these issues is underway, and a hearing on these issues was scheduled for January 24-25, 2012.
In May 2006, the State of Florida filed a motion, in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, to enforce the Settlement Agreement, for an Accounting by Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc., and for an Order of Contempt, raising substantially the same issues as raised by the Mississippi Attorney General and seeking approximately $12.4 million in additional payments under the Florida Settlement Agreement, as well as $17.0 million in interest payments. This matter is currently in the discovery phase.
In October 2008, Vibo Corporation, Inc. d/b/a General Tobacco, referred to as General, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against RJR Tobacco and other participating manufacturers, referred to as PMs, under the MSA, and the Attorneys General of the 52 states and territories that are parties to the MSA. General sought, among other things, to enjoin enforcement of certain provisions of the MSA and an order relieving it of certain of its payment obligations under the MSA and, in the event such relief was not granted, rescission of General's 2004 agreement to join the MSA. General also moved for a preliminary injunction that, among other things, would have enjoined the states from enforcing certain of General's payment obligations under the MSA. In November 2008, RJR Tobacco and the other defendants moved to dismiss General's complaint. In January 2009, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the defendants' motions and dismissing General's lawsuit. Final judgment was entered on January 5, 2010. On January 13, 2010, General noticed its appeal of this decision. Oral argument occurred on October 6, 2011, before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. A decision is pending.
In December 2007, nine states (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington) sued RJR Tobacco claiming that an advertisement published in Rolling Stone magazine the prior month violated the MSA's ban on the use of cartoons. The states asserted that the magazine's content adjacent to a Camel gatefold advertisement included cartoon images prohibited by the MSA and that certain images used in the Camel ad itself were prohibited cartoons. In addition, three states (Connecticut, New York and Maryland) also claimed that a direct mail piece distributed by RJR Tobacco violated the MSA prohibition against distributing utilitarian items bearing a tobacco brand name. Each state sought injunctive relief and punitive monetary sanctions. Eight of the nine courts have since ruled that the states are not entitled to the punitive sanctions being sought. The issue has not been resolved definitively by the court in California at this time.
Six of these magazine advertisement cases have been ruled upon following bench trials:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The three remaining cases  in Maryland, New York and Connecticut  were individually settled in the first quarter of 2010 for a non-material amount.
 The MSA includes an adjustment, referred to as an NPM Adjustment, that potentially reduces the annual payment obligations of RJR Tobacco and the other PMs. Certain requirements, collectively referred to as the Adjustment Requirements, must be satisfied before the NPM Adjustment for a given year is available:
NPM Adjustment.
 
 
When the Adjustment Requirements are satisfied, the MSA provides that the NPM Adjustment applies to reduce the annual payment obligation of the PMs. However, an individual settling state may avoid its share of the NPM Adjustment if it had in place and diligently enforced during the entirety of the relevant year a "Qualifying Statute" that imposes escrow obligations on NPMs that are comparable to what the NPMs would have owed if they had joined the MSA. In such event, the state's share of the NPM Adjustment is reallocated to other settling states, if any, that did not have in place and diligently enforce a Qualifying Statute.
 For 2003, the Adjustment Requirements were satisfied. As a result, in April 2006, RJR Tobacco placed approximately $647 million of its MSA payment into a disputed payments account, in accordance with a procedure established by the MSA. That amount represented RJR Tobacco's share of the 2003 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the MSA independent auditor. In March 2007, the independent auditor issued revised calculations that reduced RJR Tobacco's share of the NPM Adjustment for 2003 to approximately $615 million. As a result, in April 2007, RJR Tobacco instructed the independent auditor to release to the settling states approximately $32 million from the disputed payments account.
NPM Adjustment Claim for 2003.
Following RJR Tobacco's payment of a portion of its 2006 MSA payment into the disputed payments account, 37 of the settling states filed legal proceedings in their respective MSA courts seeking declaratory orders that they diligently enforced their Qualifying Statutes during 2003 and/or orders compelling RJR Tobacco and the other PMs that placed money in the disputed payments account to pay the disputed amounts to the settling states. In response, RJR Tobacco and other PMs, pursuant to the MSA's arbitration provisions, moved to compel arbitration of the parties' dispute concerning the 2003 NPM Adjustment, including the States' diligent enforcement claims, before a single, nationwide arbitration panel of three former federal judges. The settling states opposed these motions, arguing, among other things, that the issue of diligent enforcement must be resolved by MSA courts in each of the 52 settling states and territories.
As of December 31, 2011, 47 of the 48 courts that had addressed the question whether the dispute concerning the 2003 NPM Adjustment is arbitrable had ruled that arbitration is required under the MSA. The orders compelling arbitration in these states are now final and/or non-appealable. The Montana Supreme Court ruled that the state of Montana did not agree to arbitrate the question of whether it diligently enforced a qualifying statute. Trial on Montana's assertion of its diligent enforcement defense to the 2003 NPM Adjustment is set for trial on September 10, 2012. Discovery is underway.
As of January 2009, RJR Tobacco and certain other PMs entered into an Agreement Regarding Arbitration, referred to as the Arbitration Agreement, with 45 of the settling states, representing approximately 90% of the allocable share of the settling states. Pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement, signing states will have their ultimate liability (if any) with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment reduced by 20%, and RJR Tobacco and the other PMs that placed their share of the disputed 2005 NPM Adjustment (discussed below) into the disputed payments account have, without releasing or waiving any claims, authorized the release of those funds to the settling states.
Montana is one of the settling states that signed the Arbitration Agreement. Thus, notwithstanding the ruling of the Montana Supreme Court with respect to the arbitrability of the diligent enforcement issue, Montana is contractually obligated to participate with the other states in the arbitration that will address all remaining issues related to the dispute pertaining to the 2003 NPM Adjustment.
The arbitration panel contemplated by the MSA and the Arbitration Agreement has been selected, and proceedings before the panel with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment Claim have begun. An initial administrative conference was held in July 2010, and subsequent proceedings have been held since then. Document and deposition discovery has been conducted pursuant to various orders of the arbitration panel. On November 3, 2011, RJR Tobacco and the other PMs advised the arbitration panel that they were not contesting the "diligent enforcement" of 12 states and the four pacific territories with a combined allocable share of less that 14 percent. The "diligent enforcement" of the remaining 35 settling states, DC and Puerto Rico was contested and will be the subject of further proceedings. A common issues hearing has been scheduled for April 2012 and state specific evidentiary hearings will begin in May 2012. State specific hearings will continue thereafter on a monthly basis until proceedings with respect to all contested states have been completed. It is anticipated that it will be 12 to 18 months before a decision on the merits with respect to the 2003 NPM Adjustment is reached.
 From 2006 to 2008, proceedings were initiated with respect to an NPM Adjustment for 2004, 2005 and 2006. The Adjustment Requirements were satisfied with respect to the NPM Adjustment for each of 2004, 2005 and 2006. As a result:
Other NPM Adjustment Claims.
 
 
The MSA permits PMs to retain disputed payment amounts pending resolution of the dispute. If the resolution of the dispute ultimately requires a PM to pay some or all of the disputed amount, then the amount deemed to be due includes interest calculated from the date the payment was originally due at the prime rate plus three percent.
In June 2009, RJR Tobacco, certain other PMs and the settling states entered into an agreement with respect to the 2007, 2008 and 2009 significant factor determinations. This agreement provides that the settling states will not contest that the disadvantages of the MSA were "a significant factor contributing to" the market share loss experienced by the PMs in those years. The stipulation pertaining to each of the three years will become effective in February of the year a final determination by the firm of independent economic consultants would otherwise have been expected (2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively), if the issue had been arbitrated on the merits. RJR Tobacco and the PMs will pay a total amount of $5 million into the States' Antitrust/Consumer Protection Tobacco Enforcement Fund established under Section VIII(c) of the MSA for each year covered by that agreement, with RJR Tobacco paying approximately 47% of such amounts. On January 9, 2012, a new agreement with respect to significant factor determinations was entered into teams essentially identical to the earlier agreement, but pertaining to 2010, 2011 and 2012.
Based on the payment calculations of the MSA independent auditor and the agreement described above regarding in pertinent part the 2007 and 2008 significant factor determinations, the Adjustment Requirements were satisfied with respect to the NPM Adjustments for 2007 and 2008. As a result, in April 2010, RJR Tobacco placed approximately $448 million of its 2010 MSA payment (representing its share of the 2007 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the MSA independent auditor) into the disputed payments account, and in April 2011, it placed approximately $477 million of its 2011 MSA payment (representing its share of the 2008 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the MSA independent auditor) into the disputed payments account. RJR Tobacco's 2011 payment into the disputed payments account was reduced by approximately $1.1 million to adjust for a downward revision by the independent auditor to RJR Tobacco's share of the 2007 NPM Adjustment.
The table below summarizes the information discussed above with respect to the disputed portions of RJR Tobacco's MSA payment obligations from 2003 through 2008  the years as to which the Adjustment Requirements have been met:
 
In addition to the NPM Adjustment claims described above, RJR Tobacco has filed dispute notices with respect to its 2009 and 2010 annual MSA payments relating to the NPM Adjustments potentially applicable to those years. The amount at issue for those two years is approximately $937 million.
Due to the uncertainty over the final resolution of the NPM Adjustment claims asserted by RJR Tobacco, no assurances can be made related to the amounts, if any, that will be realized or any amounts (including interest) that will be owed.
Separately, on August 19, 2011, Idaho sent a letter on behalf of itself and 31 other states, stating their intent to initiate arbitration with respect to whether amounts used to measure the domestic cigarette market and to calculate PM payment obligations under the MSA should be the adjusted gross or the net number of cigarettes on which federal excise tax (including arbitrios de cigarillos) is paid. On December 15, 2011, the parties entered into an agreement regarding procedures for formation of arbitration panel with respect to this arbitration. Selection of arbitrators by the parties is underway.

A number of tobacco wholesalers and consumers have sued U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, in federal and state courts, alleging that cigarette manufacturers combined and conspired to set the price of cigarettes in violation of antitrust statutes and various state unfair business practices statutes. In these cases, the plaintiffs asked the court to certify the lawsuits as class actions on behalf of other persons who purchased cigarettes directly or indirectly from one or more of the defendants. As of December 31, 2011, all of the federal and state court cases on behalf of indirect purchasers had been dismissed, except for one state court case pending in Kansas.
In a case filed in February 2000, and pending in District Court, Seward County, Kansas, the court granted class certification in November 2001, in an action brought against the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco and B&W, and the parent companies of the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJR, seeking to recover an unspecified amount in actual and punitive damages. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix or maintain the price of cigarettes sold in the United States. The parties are currently engaged in discovery. In November 2010, RJR Tobacco and B&W filed a motion for summary judgment. A hearing on the motion occurred on January 18, 2012. A decision is pending. Trial has been scheduled for July 16, 2012.
Smith v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc.,
Other Litigation and Developments
. By purchase agreement dated May 12, 1999, referred to as the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco sold the international tobacco business to JTI. Under the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco retained certain liabilities relating to the international tobacco business sold to JTI. Under its reading of the indemnification provisions of the 1999 Purchase Agreement, JTI has requested indemnification for damages allegedly arising out of these retained liabilities. As previously reported, a number of the indemnification claims between the parties relating to the activities of Northern Brands in Canada have been resolved. See note 6 for a discussion of the Comprehensive Agreement between RJR Tobacco and the Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments, and Northern Brands' plea agreement with the Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario. Other matters for which JTI has requested indemnification for damages under the indemnification provisions of the 1999 Purchase Agreement are described below:
JTI Claims for Indemnification
 
 
 
Although RJR and RJR Tobacco recognize that, under certain circumstances, they may have these and other unresolved indemnification obligations to JTI under the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco disagree with JTI as to (1) what circumstances relating to any such matters may give rise to indemnification obligations by RJR and RJR Tobacco, and (2) the nature and extent of any such obligation. RJR and RJR Tobacco have conveyed their position to JTI, and the parties have agreed to resolve their differences at a later time.
. On October 30, 2002, the European Community and ten of its member states filed a complaint in the EDNY against RJR, RJR Tobacco and several currently and formerly related companies. The
European Community
complaint contains many of the same or similar allegations found in an earlier complaint, now dismissed, filed in August 2001 and also alleges that the defendants, together with certain identified and unidentified persons, engaged in money laundering and other conduct violating civil RICO and a variety of common laws. The complaint also alleges that the defendants manufactured cigarettes that were eventually sold in Iraq in violation of U.S. sanctions. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and treble damages among other types of relief. This matter has been stayed and largely inactive since November 24, 2009 when, with the court's permission, the European Community and member states filed and served a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint added 16 member states as plaintiffs and RAI, RJR Tobacco and R. J. Reynolds Global Products Inc., referred to as GPI as defendants. The allegations contained in the second amended complaint are in most respects either identical or similar to those found in the prior complaint, but now add new allegations primarily regarding the activities of RAI, RJR Tobacco and GPI following the B&W business combination. Pursuant to a stipulation and order, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' second amended complaint on February 15, 2010. Oral argument of the motion occurred on October 26, 2010. Supplemental briefs were then filed. Ruling on part of the defendants' motion to dismiss, on March 8, 2011, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' RICO claims, and reserved decision as to dismissal of the plaintiffs' state-law claims. Thereafter, on May 13, 2011, the court granted the remaining portion of the defendants' motion and dismissed the plaintiffs' state-law claims based on the court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 16, 2011, the clerk of court entered a judgment dismissing the action in its entirety. On June 10, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, appealing from the May 16, 2011 judgment, as well as the March 8, 2011 and May 13, 2011 orders that respectively resulted in the dismissal of their RICO and state-law claims. Briefing is complete. Oral argument has been scheduled for February 24, 2012.
On May 23, 2001, and July 30, 2002, Star Scientific, Inc. filed two patent infringement actions, later consolidated, against RJR Tobacco in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The consolidated action, known as , involved two patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,202,649 and 6,425,401), both entitled "Method of Treating Tobacco to Reduce Nitrosamine Content, and Products Produced Thereby." Star accused RJR Tobacco of infringing certain claims of these patents during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons and asked the court to: enter an injunction restraining RJR Tobacco from further acts of infringement; award Star damages, including a reasonable royalty, to compensate for the infringement; increase the damages due to willfulness; award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and reasonable attorney fees; and order RJR Tobacco to deliver up to the court for destruction all products manufactured from any process that infringes any claim of either patent. RJR Tobacco filed counterclaims seeking a declaration that the asserted claims of Star's patents are invalid, unenforceable and not infringed by RJR Tobacco. Between January 31 and February 8, 2005, the court held a first bench trial on RJR Tobacco's affirmative defense and counterclaim based upon inequitable conduct. Additionally, in response to the court's invitation, RJR Tobacco filed two summary judgment motions in January 2005.
Star Patent Infringement.
Star I
In January 2007, the court granted RJR Tobacco's motion for summary judgment of invalidity based on indefiniteness. The court granted in part and denied in part, RJR Tobacco's other summary judgment motion concerning the effective filing date of Star's patents. In June 2007, the court ruled that Star's patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by Star and its representatives in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, referred to as the PTO, and entered final judgment in favor of RJR Tobacco and against Star. Star filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In August 2008, the Federal Circuit issued a decision reversing the district court's rulings against Star and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the issues of validity and infringement. Star updated its reasonable royalty damages calculation to a range of $294.9 million to $362.1 million.
In late 2008, RJR Tobacco petitioned the PTO to reexamine the claims of Star's patents at issue in based on substantial new questions of patentability. The PTO agreed to reexamine the claims ex parte. The district court decided to move forward with the trial in rather than await the outcome of the reexamination proceedings.

Trial began on May 18, 2009, and on June 16, 2009, the jury returned a verdict in favor of RJR Tobacco on every question put to it. The jury decided that RJR Tobacco had not infringed either of Star's patents and that the patents were invalid on four independent bases.
Shortly after the start of the jury trial, in May 2009, Star filed a follow-on lawsuit   in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland seeking damages for alleged infringement during the 2003 growing season and beyond of the two Star patents found invalid and not infringed in . The district court stayed pending the outcome of proceedings in , and was administratively closed pending further order of the district court upon the application, by December 31, 2012, of any party.

In November 2009, RJR Tobacco filed a bill of costs (later renewed) seeking reimbursement of its recoverable costs as the prevailing party in , and also filed a motion seeking reimbursement of its attorney fees and excess costs incurred in defending . In December 2009, the district court upheld the jury verdict by denying Star's combined motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial. The court entered judgment in RJR Tobacco's favor and awarded RJR Tobacco all assessable costs. The court deferred proceedings with respect to RJR Tobacco's motion for attorneys' fees and excess costs pending final resolution of the reexamination and any appellate proceedings.

On Star's request and without objection from RJR Tobacco, the district court deferred briefing on RJR Tobacco's renewed bill of costs until after the resolution of appellate proceedings.
In December 2009, Star filed a notice of appeal in the Federal Circuit from the district court's final judgment order. On August 26, 2011, the Federal Circuit issued a decision affirming the jury's finding of non-infringement but reversing, in a split decision, on invalidity. Writing in dissent, Judge Dyk stated that he would affirm the jury's finding of invalidity based upon indefiniteness.
On September 26, 2011, RJR Tobacco filed a combined petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc with the Federal Circuit seeking rehearing on whether Star's patents at issue are invalid based upon indefiniteness. The Federal Circuit denied RJR Tobacco's combined petition on November 29, 2011, and the Federal Circuit's judgment issued as a mandate on December 15, 2011. Star I has now returned to the district court for further proceedings on RJR Tobacco's bill of cost and motion for attorneys' fees and excess costs. A status conference occurred on January 24, 2012. and have been stayed and referred to the magistrate judge for mediation purposes.

In the PTO reexamination proceeding, the PTO in March and April 2011 issued ex parte reexamination certificates confirming the patentability of the claims of the Star patents at issue in .

In November, 2009, RAI and B&W were served with subpoenas issued by the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense, seeking two broad categories of documents in connection with a civil investigation:
Other Matters.
 
 
RAI and RJRT have responded to the subpoenas, including the extent to which the subpoenas seek documents regarding the domestic tobacco operations acquired from B&W in 2004, and believes this matter is now closed.
In May 2011, RJR Tobacco and SFNTC received separate letters from counsel to Walgreen Co. regarding a 60-day notice served on Walgreen by a consumer group alleging violations of California's Proposition 65. The group claims that Walgreen provided or sold products with containers or wrappers containing insufficient warning in violation of California law. Walgreen believes that RJR Tobacco and SFNTC provided the noticed products, and is requesting that RJR Tobacco and SFNTC pay for Walgreen's defense, indemnify Walgreen and hold Walgreen harmless from all liability, loss or expense (including legal expense) related to sales of any products covered by the 60-day notice, manufactured or distributed to Walgreen by RJR Tobacco and SFNTC. In June 2011, RJR Tobacco submitted a reply to Walgreen's counsel, and SFNTC submitted a reply in July 2011. Neither company has received a response from Walgreen's counsel. RJR Tobacco and SFNTC each believes that it has valid defenses to Walgreen's claims.
Finally, in the first quarter of 2005, Commonwealth Brands, Inc., referred to as Commonwealth, was served with an individual smoking and health case, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Commonwealth requested indemnity from RJR Tobacco pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 24, 1996, between Commonwealth and B&W, referred to as the 1996 Purchase Agreement. As a result of the B&W business combination, RJR Tobacco agreed to indemnify Commonwealth for this claim to the extent, if any, required by the 1996 Purchase Agreement. The scope of the indemnity will be at issue and has not been determined.
Croft v. Akron Gasket
Smokeless Tobacco Litigation
As of December 31, 2011, American Snuff Co. was a defendant in six actions brought by individual plaintiffs in West Virginia state court seeking damages in connection with personal injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the usage of American Snuff Co.'s smokeless tobacco products. These actions are pending before the same West Virginia court as the 577 consolidated individual smoker cases against RJR Tobacco, B&W, as RJR Tobacco's indemnitee, or both. Pursuant to the court's December 3, 2001, order, the smokeless tobacco claims and defendants remain severed.
Pursuant to a second amended complaint filed in September 2006, American Snuff Co. is a defendant in , pending in the Eleventh Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The individual plaintiff alleges that he sustained personal injuries, including addiction and cancer, as a result of his use of smokeless tobacco products, allegedly including products manufactured by American Snuff Co. The plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and consequential damages in an amount greater than $15,000. There is not a punitive damages demand in this case, though the plaintiff retains the right to seek leave of court to add such a demand later. Discovery is underway.
Vassallo v. United States Tobacco Company
American Snuff Co. was served with a complaint that was filed in October 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, The plaintiff alleges that as a result of her use of the defendants' smokeless tobacco products, she developed oral cancer. The plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. On January 13, 2012, American Snuff Co. filed its answer to the complaint.
Vertison v. American Snuff Co., LLC.
Tobacco Buyout Legislation and Related Litigation
In 2004, legislation was passed eliminating the U.S. government's tobacco production controls and price support program. The buyout of tobacco quota holders provided for in the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act, referred to as FETRA, is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer, on a market-share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied. The aggregate cost of the buyout to the industry is approximately $9.9 billion, including approximately $9.6 billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years and approximately $290 million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock. As a result of the tobacco buyout legislation, the MSA Phase II obligations established in 1999 continued as scheduled through the end of 2010, but were offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. RAI's operating subsidiaries' annual expense under FETRA for 2012 and thereafter, excluding the tobacco stock liquidation assessment, is estimated to be approximately $220 million to $240 million.
RAI's operating subsidiaries recorded the FETRA assessment on a quarterly basis as cost of goods sold. RAI's operating subsidiaries estimate that their overall share of the buyout will approximate $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the MSA. In addition, future market pricing could impact the carrying value of inventory, and adversely affect RJR Tobacco's financial position and results of operations.
As noted above, the MSA Phase II obligations were offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. Because growers in two states, Maryland and Pennsylvania, did not participate in the quota system, they are not eligible for payments under FETRA. Given that the assessments paid by tobacco product manufacturers and importers under FETRA fully offset their MSA Phase II payment obligations, the growers in Maryland and Pennsylvania would no longer receive payments under the MSA Phase II program. Thus, the growers in these two states do not receive payments under either FETRA or the MSA Phase II program.
ERISA Litigation
In May 2002, in , an employee of RJR Tobacco filed a class-action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging that the defendants, RJR, RJR Tobacco, the RJR Employee Benefits Committee and the RJR Pension Investment Committee, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, referred to as ERISA. The actions about which the plaintiff complains stem from a decision made in 1999 by RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., subsequently renamed Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., referred to as NGH, to spin off RJR, thereby separating NGH's tobacco business and food business. As part of the spin-off, the 401(k) plan for the previously related entities had to be divided into two separate plans for the now separate tobacco and food businesses. The plaintiff contends that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to participants of the RJR 401(k) plan when the defendants removed the stock funds of the companies involved in the food business, NGH and Nabisco Holdings Corp., referred to as Nabisco, as investment options from the RJR 401(k) plan approximately six months after the spin-off. The plaintiff asserts that a November 1999 amendment (the "1999 Amendment") that eliminated the NGH and Nabisco funds from the RJR 401(k) plan on January 31, 2000, contained sufficient discretion for the defendants to have retained the NGH and Nabisco funds after January 31, 2000, and that the failure to exercise such discretion was a breach of fiduciary duty. In his complaint, the plaintiff requests, among other things, that the court require the defendants to pay as damages to the RJR 401(k) plan an amount equal to the subsequent appreciation that was purportedly lost as a result of the liquidation of the NGH and Nabisco funds.
Tatum v. The R.J.R. Pension Investment Committee of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Capital Investment Plan
In July 2002, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted in December 2003. In December 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that the 1999 Amendment did contain sufficient discretion for the defendants to have retained the NGH and Nabisco funds as of February 1, 2000, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint and denied all pending motions as moot. In April 2007, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, dismissing all claims against the RJR Employee Benefits Committee and the RJR Pension Investment Committee. The remaining defendants, RJR and RJR Tobacco, filed their answer and affirmative defenses in June 2007. The plaintiff filed a motion for class certification, which the court granted in September 2008. The district court ordered mediation, but no resolution of the case was reached. In September 2008, each of the plaintiffs and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment, and in January 2009, the defendants filed a motion to decertify the class. A second mediation occurred in June 2009, but again no resolution of the case was reached. The district court overruled the motions for summary judgment and the motion to decertify the class.
A non-jury trial was held in January and February 2010. During closing arguments, the plaintiff argued for the first time that certain facts arising at trial showed that the 1999 Amendment was not validly adopted, and then moved to amend his complaint to conform to this evidence at trial. On June 1, 2011, the court granted the plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint and found that the 1999 Amendment was invalid.
The parties filed their findings of fact and conclusions of law on February 4, 2011. A decision is pending.
Environmental Matters
RAI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Such laws and regulations provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances. In the past, RJR Tobacco has been named a potentially responsible party with third parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act with respect to several superfund sites. RAI and its subsidiaries are not aware of any current environmental matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries.
In September 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, referred to as EPA, passed a rule which requires companies to monitor greenhouse gas, referred to as GHG, emissions beginning in January, 2010 and, depending
upon the industry in which the particular company operates or the amount of the company's GHG emissions, report these emissions to EPA on an annual basis, beginning in 2011. Based upon its GHG emission levels, RJR Tobacco submitted the required GHG emissions reports to the EPA pertaining to one of its facilities. RJR Tobacco is fully prepared to make annual submissions in accordance with the EPA's regulations.
RAI and its operating subsidiaries believe that climate change is an environmental issue primarily driven by carbon dioxide emissions from the use of energy. RAI's operating subsidiaries are working to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by minimizing the use of energy where cost effective, minimizing waste to landfills and increasing recycling. Climate change is not viewed by RAI's operating subsidiaries as a significant direct economic risk to their businesses, but rather an indirect risk involving the potential for a longer term general increase in the cost of doing business. Regulatory changes are difficult to predict, but the current regulatory risks to the business of RAI's operating subsidiaries with respect to climate change are relatively low. Financial impacts will be driven more by the cost of natural gas and electricity. Efforts are made to mitigate the effect of increases in fuel costs directly impacting RAI's operating subsidiaries by evaluating natural gas usage and market conditions, and occasionally purchasing forward contracts, limited to a three-year period, for natural gas. In addition, RAI's operating subsidiaries are constantly evaluating electrical energy conservation measures and energy efficient equipment to mitigate impacts of increases in electrical energy costs.
Regulations promulgated by the EPA and other governmental agencies under various statutes have resulted in, and likely will continue to result in, substantial expenditures for pollution control, waste treatment, facility modification and similar activities. RAI and its subsidiaries are engaged in a continuing program to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and dependent upon the probability of occurrence and reasonable estimation of cost, accrue or disclose any material liability. Although it is difficult to reasonably estimate the portion of capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, RAI does not expect such expenditures or other costs to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries.
Other Contingencies
In connection with the sale of the international tobacco business to JTI, pursuant to the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco agreed to indemnify JTI against:
 
 
 
As described above in " Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry  Other Litigation and DevelopmentsJTI Claims for Indemnification," RJR Tobacco has received claims for indemnification from JTI, and several of these have been resolved. Although RJR and RJR Tobacco recognize that, under certain circumstances, they may have other unresolved indemnification obligations to JTI under the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJR Tobacco disagree what circumstances described in such claims give rise to any indemnification obligations by RJR and RJR Tobacco and the nature and extent of any such obligation. RJR and RJR Tobacco have conveyed their position to JTI, and the parties have agreed to resolve their differences at a later date.
RJR Tobacco, SFNTC and American Snuff Co. have entered into agreements to indemnify certain distributors and retailers from liability and related defense costs arising out of the sale or distribution of their products. Additionally, Santa Fe has entered into an agreement to indemnify a supplier from liability and related defense costs arising out of the sale or use of Santa Fe's products. The cost has been, and is expected to be, insignificant. RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and American Snuff Co. believe that the indemnified claims are substantially similar in nature and extent to the claims that they are already exposed to by virtue of their having manufactured those products.
Except as otherwise noted above, RAI is not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, related to these indemnification obligations.
Lease Commitments
RAI has operating lease agreements that are primarily for office space, automobiles, warehouse space and computer equipment. The majority of these leases expire within the next five years and some contain renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses or restrictions relating to subleases. Total rent expense was $18 million, $20 million and $20 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2011 were as follows:

WHEREAS, each Guarantor is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Borrower;
WHEREAS, the Credit Agreement requires that this Guarantee be executed and delivered; and
WHEREAS, each Guarantor will obtain benefits from the incurrence of Term Loans by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and, accordingly, desires to execute this Guarantee in order to induce the Lenders to make Term Loans to the Borrower;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other benefits accruing to each Guarantor, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and hereby covenants and agrees with each other Guarantor and the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors as follows:
1. . (a) Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees as a primary obligor and not merely as surety to the Guaranteed Creditors the full and prompt payment when due (whether at the stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on all Term Loans incurred by the Borrower, together with all the other obligations (including obligations which, but for the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due) and liabilities and indebtedness (including, without limitation,
GUARANTEE
indemnities and fees (including any interest accruing after the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding at the rate provided for in the Credit Agreement, whether or not such interest is an allowed claim in any such proceeding)) owing by the Borrower to any Guaranteed Creditor, whether now existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of or in connection with, the Credit Agreement and the due performance and compliance by the Borrower with all of the terms, conditions and agreements contained in the Credit Agreement (all such principal, interest, liabilities, indebtedness and obligations under this clause (a) being herein collectively called the "").
Guaranteed Obligations
Each Guarantor understands, agrees and confirms that the Guaranteed Creditors may enforce this Guarantee up to the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations against such Guarantor without proceeding against any other Guarantor or the Borrower or under any other guarantee covering all or a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Guarantee is a guarantee of prompt payment and performance and not of collection.
(b) Additionally, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably, guarantees the payment of any and all Guaranteed Obligations whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the occurrence in respect of the Borrower of any of the events specified in clauses (h), (i) and (j) of Article VII of the Credit Agreement, and unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably, jointly and severally, promises to pay such Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand.
2. . The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is primary, absolute, joint and several, and unconditional and is exclusive and independent of any other guarantee of the indebtedness of the Borrower whether executed by such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected or impaired by any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever, including, without limitation: (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or any other party, (b) any other continuing or other guarantee, undertaking or maximum liability of a Guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed Obligations, (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guarantee or undertaking, (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, (e) the failure of the Guarantor to receive any benefit from or as a result of its execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee, (f) any payment made to any Guaranteed Creditor on the indebtedness which any Guaranteed Creditor repays the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, (g) any action or inaction by the Guaranteed Creditors as contemplated in Section 5 hereof or (h) any invalidity, rescission, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.
LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE
3. . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower be joined in any such action or actions. Each Guarantor waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) the benefits of any statute of limitations affecting its liability
OBLIGATIONS OF GUARANTORS INDEPENDENT
 
hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each Guarantor.
4. . (a) Each Guarantor hereby waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and notice of the existence, creation or incurrence of any new or additional liability to which it may apply, and waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, demand for performance, protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities, suit or taking of other action by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor against, and any other notice to, any party liable thereon (including such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower) and each Guarantor further hereby waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice or proof of reliance by any Guaranteed Creditor upon this Guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended, modified, supplemented or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee.
WAIVERS BY GUARANTORS
(b) Each Guarantor waives any right to require the Guaranteed Creditors to: (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party; or (ii) pursue any other remedy in the Guaranteed Creditors' power whatsoever. Each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party other than payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, exercise any right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against the Borrower or any other party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement, contribution, indemnification or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other party.
(c) Each Guarantor has knowledge and assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's and each other Guarantor's financial condition, affairs and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and has adequate means to obtain from the Borrower and each other Guarantor on an ongoing basis information relating thereto and the Borrower's and each other Guarantor's ability to pay and perform its respective Guaranteed Obligations, and agrees to assume the responsibility for keeping, and to keep, so informed for so long as this Guarantee is in effect. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (x) the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no obligation to investigate the financial condition or affairs of the Borrower or any other Guarantor for the benefit of such Guarantor nor to advise such Guarantor of any fact respecting,
 
or any change in, the financial condition, assets or affairs of the Borrower or any other Guarantor that might become known to any Guaranteed Creditor at any time, whether or not such Guaranteed Creditor knows or believes or has reason to know or believe that any such fact or change is unknown to such Guarantor, or might (or does) increase the risk of such Guarantor as guarantor hereunder, or might (or would) affect the willingness of such Guarantor to continue as a guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder and (y) the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to them regarding any of the aforementioned circumstances or risks.
(d) Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that no Guaranteed Creditor nor any other Person shall be under any obligation to pursue any remedy that such Guarantor may or may not be able to pursue itself any right to which such Guarantor hereby waives.
(e) Each Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth in Section 3 and in this Section 4 is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
5. . Subject to Section 4, any Guaranteed Creditor may (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) at any time and from time to time without the consent of, or notice to, any Guarantor, without incurring responsibility to such Guarantor, without impairing or releasing the obligations or liabilities of such Guarantor hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in part:
RIGHTS OF GUARANTEED CREDITORS
(a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change, increase or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including, without limitation, any increase or decrease in the rate of interest thereon or the principal amount thereof), or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Guarantee shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, increased, accelerated, renewed or altered;
(b) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other guarantor of the Borrower or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting;
(c) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, Guarantors, other guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors;
(d) settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of the Borrower to the respective creditors of the Borrower other than the Guaranteed Creditors;
 
(e) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liabilities of the Borrower remain unpaid;
(f) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, any of the Loan Documents or any of the instruments or agreements referred to therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Loan Documents or any of such other instruments or agreements;
(g) act or fail to act in any manner which may deprive such Guarantor of its right to subrogation against the Borrower to recover full indemnity for any payments made pursuant to this Guarantee; and/or
(h) take any other action or omit to take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor from its liabilities under this Guarantee (including, without limitation, any action or omission whatsoever that might otherwise vary the risk of such Guarantor or constitute a legal or equitable defense to or discharge of the liabilities of a guarantor or surety that might otherwise limit recourse against such Guarantor).
No invalidity, illegality, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating to the Guaranteed Obligations or of any guarantee therefor shall affect, impair or be a defense to this Guarantee, and this Guarantee shall be primary, absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor except payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations.
6. . This Guarantee is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. No failure or delay on the part of any Guaranteed Creditor in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Guaranteed Creditor would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Guaranteed Creditor to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations incurred in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
CONTINUING GUARANTEE
7. . Any indebtedness of the Borrower now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors; and such indebtedness of the Borrower to any Guarantor, if the Administrative Agent, after an Event of Default has occurred
SUBORDINATION OF INDEBTEDNESS HELD BY GUARANTORS
 
and is continuing, so requests, shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guarantee. Prior to the transfer by any Guarantor of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of the Borrower to such Guarantor, such Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guarantee (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash; , that if any amount shall be paid to such Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the irrevocable payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and shall forthwith be paid to the Guaranteed Creditors to be credited and applied upon the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents or, if the Loan Documents do not provide for the application of such amount, to be held by the Guaranteed Creditors as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations thereafter existing.
provided
8. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Guarantee, the Guaranteed Creditors agree (by their acceptance of the benefits of this Guarantee) that this Guarantee may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders and that no other Guaranteed Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guarantee, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors upon the terms of this Guarantee. The Guaranteed Creditors further agree that this Guarantee may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee, partner, member or stockholder of any Guarantor (except to the extent such partner, member or stockholder is also a Guarantor hereunder). It is understood and agreed that the agreement in this Section 8 is among and solely for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and that, if the Required Lenders so agree (without requiring the consent of any Guarantor), this Guarantee may be directly enforced by any Guaranteed Creditor.
GUARANTEE ENFORCEABLE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
9. . In order to induce the Lenders to make Term Loans to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor represents, warrants and covenants that:

REINSTATEMENT
16. . (a) THIS GUARANTEE AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE GUARANTEED CREDITORS AND OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Guarantee or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Guaranteed Creditors may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Guarantee or any other Loan Document against any Guarantor or its respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS; AND WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
(b) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in clause (a) of this Section 16. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 
(c) Each party to this Guarantee irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. Nothing in this Guarantee or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party hereto or thereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
(d) EACH GUARANTOR AND EACH GUARANTEED CREDITOR (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS GUARANTEE) HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTEE, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS GUARANTEE BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 16.
17. . (a) This Guarantee shall, as to each Guarantor, be released (i) if such Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement or that has been consented to in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement, (ii) if such Guarantor ceases to be a Material Subsidiary in accordance with the requirements of the definition of "Material Subsidiary" set forth in the Credit Agreement (including as a result of a designation pursuant to the second proviso appearing in the first sentence of such definition) or (iii) under the circumstances described in clause (b) below; , except in the case of preceding clause (iii), that (x) no such release shall occur if such Guarantor continues to be a guarantor in respect of (I) the Existing Credit Agreement or (II) any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount equal to or greater than $50,000,000, unless and until such Subsidiary is (or is being simultaneously) released from its guarantee with respect to the Existing Credit Agreement or such Indebtedness, as the case may be, and (y) no such release shall occur if a Default has then occurred and is continuing.
RELEASE OF LIABILITY OF GUARANTOR
provided
(b) At such time as the Term Loans and all other Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Term Loan Commitments have been terminated, the Guarantors shall be released from their obligations under this Guarantee, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any Person.
18. . At any time a payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is made under this Guarantee, the right of contribution of each Guarantor against each other Guarantor shall be determined as provided in the immediately following sentence, with the right of contribution of each Guarantor to be revised and restated as of each date on which a payment (a "") is made on the Guaranteed Obligations under this
CONTRIBUTION
Relevant Payment
 
Guarantee. At any time that a Relevant Payment is made by a Guarantor that results in the aggregate payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment exceeding such Guarantor's Contribution Percentage (as defined below) of the aggregate payments made by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment (such excess, the ""), each such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Guarantor who has made payments in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment in an aggregate amount less than such other Guarantor's Contribution Percentage of the aggregate payments made to and including the date of the Relevant Payment by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (the aggregate amount of such deficit, the "") in an amount equal to (a) a fraction the numerator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of such Guarantor and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of all Guarantors multiplied by (b) the Aggregate Deficit Amount of such other Guarantor. A Guarantor's right of contribution pursuant to the preceding sentences shall arise at the time of each computation, subject to adjustment to the time of each computation; that no Guarantor may take any action to enforce such right until the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash and all Term Loan Commitments have been terminated, it being expressly recognized and agreed by all parties hereto that any Guarantor's right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 18 against any other Guarantor shall be expressly junior and subordinate to such other Guarantor's obligations and liabilities in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations owing under this Guarantee. As used in this Section 18: (i) each Guarantor's "" shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the Adjusted Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor by (y) the aggregate Adjusted Net Worth of all Guarantors; (ii) the "" of each Guarantor shall mean the greater of (x) the Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor and (y) zero; and (iii) the "" of each Guarantor shall mean the amount by which the fair saleable value of such Guarantor's assets on the date of any Relevant Payment exceeds its existing debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but without giving effect to any Guaranteed Obligations arising under this Guarantee) on such date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, any Guarantor that is released from this Guarantee pursuant to Section 17 hereof shall thereafter have no contribution obligations, or rights, pursuant to this Section 18, and at the time of any such release, if the released Guarantor had an Aggregate Excess Amount or an Aggregate Deficit Amount, same shall be deemed reduced to $0, and the contribution rights and obligations of the remaining Guarantors shall be recalculated on the respective date of release (as otherwise provided above) based on the payments made hereunder by the remaining Guarantors. All parties hereto recognize and agree that, except for any right of contribution arising pursuant to this Section 18, each Guarantor who makes any payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have no right of contribution or subrogation against any other Guarantor in respect of such payment until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash. Each of the Guarantors recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the party entitled to such contribution. In this connection, each Guarantor has the right to waive its contribution right against any Guarantor to the extent that after giving effect to such waiver such Guarantor would remain solvent, in the determination of the Required Lenders.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Guarantor and each Guaranteed Creditor (by its acceptance of the benefits of this Guarantee) hereby irrevocably agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed by such Guarantor shall be limited to such amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or otherwise) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws and after giving effect to any rights to contribution pursuant to any agreement providing for an equitable contribution among such Guarantor and the other Guarantors, result in the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor in respect of such maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
