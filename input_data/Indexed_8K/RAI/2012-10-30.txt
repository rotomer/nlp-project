provided, further
 
pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred upon the receipt by the Indemnifying Person of an invoice therefor. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred upon the receipt by the Indemnifying Person of an invoice therefor. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, the Guarantors, their respective directors, their respective officers and any control persons of the Company and the Guarantors shall be designated in writing by the Company and the Guarantors. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 10 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering
Contribution
 
price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) . The Company and the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim subject to the receipt by the Indemnifying Person of an invoice therefor. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
pro rata
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
 
This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
 
This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company and the Guarantors, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or the Guarantors shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; (iv) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred; or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information.
 
(a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters
 
do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and Time of Sale Information or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agree to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Schedule 2
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters.

The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus and prospectus supplement) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and prospectus supplement in that registration statement and other documents the issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the issuer, any underwriter or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling Citigroup Global Markets Inc. toll-free at 1 (800) 831-9146 or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC collect at 1 (212) 834-4533.
 
(1) The Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act. The Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus were filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act within the time periods specified for such filings. To our knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company or any other registrant and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering is pending or threatened by the Commission.
(2) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appear on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act.
(3) The Indenture, as supplemented, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and each Guarantor and, assuming due execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes the valid and legally binding agreement of the Company and the Guarantors enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions; and the Indenture appears on its face to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission applicable to an indenture that is qualified thereunder.
(4) The Securities, substantially in the form approved by the pricing committee, as authorized by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to authority delegated by the Board of Directors of the Company, have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when duly authenticated and delivered as provided in the Indenture and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture. Each Guarantee (other than the Guarantee of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc.) has been duly authorized and executed by the applicable Guarantor, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Guarantee of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc. and the due authentication, issuance and delivery of the Securities underlying the Guarantees as provided in the Indenture upon payment therefor in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, each Guarantee (including the Guarantee of Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc.) will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of the applicable Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
(5) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantors.
(6) The statements made in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Description of the Debt Securities," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of the Transaction Documents, fairly summarize such terms in all material respects.
 
(7) The statements in each of the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the heading "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," to the extent they constitute summaries of law or regulation or legal conclusions, fairly summarize the matters described therein in all material respects.
(8) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when filed with the Commission, appear on their face to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(9) None of the Company or any Guarantor is, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus will be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
(10) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the Guarantors of the Transaction Documents, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees and compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with the terms of the Securities and the Guarantees and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents will not result in the violation of any law or statute of the State of New York that, in such counsel's experience, are customarily applicable to transactions such as those contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
(11) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any New York State governmental or regulatory authority, or to our knowledge, any New York State court, is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the Guarantors of each of the Transaction Documents, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees and compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with the terms thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders and registrations or qualifications as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
Such counsel shall also state that they have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company and the Guarantors and with representatives of their independent accountants and counsel at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above) and have made no independent check or verification thereof, subject to the foregoing, nothing has come to the attention of such counsel to cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time of its effective date (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, nothing has come to the attention of such counsel to cause such counsel to believe that as of the Time of Sale, that the Time of Sale Information contained any untrue statement of a
 
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than in each case, the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification under the Trust Indenture Act on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, the financial statements and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief).
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and the Guarantors, and certificates of public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
The opinion of Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and the Guarantors and shall so state therein.

The Company and each Guarantor are duly qualified to transact business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of their respective businesses or their respective ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(4) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the Guarantors of each of the Transaction Documents, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees and compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with the terms thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders and registrations or qualifications as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
(5) After due inquiry, such counsel does not know of legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any of their properties is or may be subject other than proceedings fairly summarized in all material respects in, or incorporated by reference into, the Registration Statement, Time of Sale
 
Information or Prospectus, exclusive of any proceedings that such counsel believes would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the power or ability of the Company or any Guarantor to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
(6) The descriptions in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus of statutes, legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings and contracts and other documents fairly summarize in all material respects such statutes, legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings and contracts and other documents.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and the Guarantors and certificates of public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
The opinion of McDara P. Folan, III, described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and the Guarantors and shall so state therein.
 
(1) SFNTC is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New Mexico and has full corporate power and authority to own property and to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
(2) SFNTC has the full right, power and authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder; and all action required to be taken for the due and proper authorization, execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, has been duly and validly taken.
