The Firm Stock and the Option Stock, if purchased, are hereinafter collectively called the "Stock." This is to confirm the agreement concerning the purchase of the Stock from the Company by the Underwriter. 1. Representations, Warranties and Agreements of the Company. The Company represents, warrants and agrees that: (a) A registration statement on Form S-3 including a prospectus, relating to, among other securities, the Stock and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act has (i) been prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder, (ii) been filed with the Commission under the Securities Act (File No. 333-110601), and (iii) become effective under the Securities Act. Copies of such registration statement have been delivered by the Company to you. As provided in Section 5(a), a prospectus supplement reflecting the terms of the offering of the Stock and the other matters set forth therein has been prepared and will be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act. Such prospectus supplement, in the form first filed after the Effective Time (as defined below) pursuant to Rule 424, is herein referred to as the "Prospectus Supplement". Such registration statement, as amended at the Effective Time, including the exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement", and the basic prospectus included therein relating to all offerings of securities under the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, is herein
called the "Prospectus", except that, if such basic prospectus is amended or supplemented on or prior to the date on which the Prospectus Supplement is first filed pursuant to Rule 424, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to the basic prospectus as so amended or supplemented and as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in either case including the documents filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are incorporated by reference therein. As used herein, "Effective Time" means the date and the time as of which such Registration Statement, or the most recent post-effective amendment thereto, if any, was declared effective by the Commission; "Effective Date" means the date of the Effective Time; "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement" means each Prospectus Supplement included in a registration statement, or amendments thereof, after the Registration Statement became effective under the Securities Act but containing a "Subject to Completion" legend comparable to that contained in paragraph 10 of Item 501 under Regulation S-K of the Rules and Regulations.

(f) At the time of execution of this Agreement, the Underwriter shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, addressed to the Underwriter and dated the date hereof (i) confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (ii) stating, as of the date hereof (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus Supplement, as of a date 18
not more than five days prior to the date hereof), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters ordinarily covered by accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings. (g) With respect to the letter of Deloitte & Touche LLP referred to in the preceding paragraph and delivered to the Underwriter concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "initial letter"), the Company shall have furnished to the Underwriter a letter (the "bring-down letter") of such accountants, addressed to the Underwriter and dated such Delivery Date, (i) confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (ii) stating, as of the date of the bring-down letter (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the Prospectus Supplement, as of a date not more than five days prior to the date of the bring-down letter), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by the initial letter and (iii) confirming in all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial letter.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus Supplement any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement or (ii) 19
since such date there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement (and except for shares of Common Stock issued in connection with exercises of options and conversions of convertible debentures granted under the Company's existing employee benefit plans, qualified stock option plans or other employee compensation plans), the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is, in the judgment of the Underwriter, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Stock being delivered on such Delivery Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement. (j) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities.

(l) The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. shall have approved the Stock for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance. 20
All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriter. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Stock), to which that Underwriter, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by the Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Stock or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (provided that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by the Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct), and shall reimburse the Underwriter and each such officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Underwriter by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein 21
which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(e). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of the Underwriter; provided, however, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(a) shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Stock concerned if, to the extent such sale was an initial sale by the Underwriter and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of the Underwriter is a result of the fact that both (A) a copy of the Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the time of the written confirmation of the sale of such Stock to such person, and (B) the untrue statement or omission in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement was corrected in the Prospectus Supplement; provided further, however, that this limitation shall have no effect unless the Company has complied with its obligation under Section 5(c) of this Agreement and the Underwriter has a legal obligation to deliver a Prospectus Supplement to the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities. (b) The Underwriter shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers who have signed the Registration Statement, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A) in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) in any Blue Sky Application or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the 22
Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Underwriter shall have the right to employ counsel to represent the Underwriter and its officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriter against the Company under this Section 8 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, it is advisable for the Underwriter and those officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to the fees and expenses of any local counsel that may be retained for the action) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent 23
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other from the offering of the Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Stock purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter with respect to the shares of the Stock purchased under this Agreement on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the shares of the Stock under this Agreement, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriter, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the 24
amount by which the total price at which the Stock underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) The Underwriter confirms and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to (i) the public offering of the Stock by the Underwriter and the over-allotment option set forth on the cover page of, (ii) the identity of the Underwriter, the statement as to the Underwriter's participation in the sale of Stock, and the Underwriter's proposal to offer the Stock to the public under the caption "Underwriting" in, and (iii) the paragraphs addressing the commissions and expenses, over-allotment option, and affiliates under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Prospectus Supplement are correct and constitute the only information concerning the Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement. 9.

Reimbursement of Underwriter's Expenses. If the Company shall fail to tender the Stock for delivery to the Underwriter by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriter's obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriter in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Stock, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to the Underwriter. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 by reason of the default of the Underwriter, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse the Underwriter on account of the Underwriter's expenses. 12.
