HOUSTON, TEXAS -
 
Rowan Companies, Inc. (NYSE: RDC) (Rowan) today announced that its previously released condensed financial information for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 has been revised. As adjusted, Rowans after-tax income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 is $26.4 million or $.25 per share, its after-tax loss from discontinued aviation operations is $27.6 million or $.26 per share, and its net loss is $1.3 million or $.01 per share.
The registered public accounting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP has completed their audit and has issued an unqualified opinion with respect to Rowans consolidated financial statements to be included in our 2004 Annual Report to stockholders.
The Company has made several adjustments and reclassifications to the unaudited consolidated financial information that was released on January 19, 2005, which had the following full year effects:
The Company has determined that the aggregate effects of these adjustments are not material to any previous annual or interim period.
EXHIBIT 99.1
We have completed our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
 
over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Based upon our documentation and testing, Rowan did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 within the context of the framework
 
developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our assessment identified a pervasive internal control deficiency that represented a material weakness. The control deficiency resulted from the lack of effective detective and monitoring controls within internal control over financial reporting. These conditions were manifested in a number of adjustments to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 that, although not material in the aggregate, affect various financial statement line items. We are working hard throughout the Rowan organization to remedy all internal control deficiencies relative to COSO and expect to be fully compliant by the end of 2005.

HOUSTON, TEXAS -
 
Rowan Companies, Inc. (NYSE: RDC) (Rowan) today announced that on February 7, 2005, the Company assigned its operating lease agreements and sold the purchase options it held on four anchor-handling, towing and supply boats. Net proceeds to Rowan from the assignment and sale were approximately $21 million.
Rowan obtained the boats in 1999 and 2000 through charter agreements that gave the Company an option to purchase each boat at the conclusion of the lease term in March 2005. The boats were fully-crewed by the charterer, but managed by Rowan to provide towing and supply services for the Companys drilling operations and for third parties. Rowan continues to operate two additional boats under operating lease agreements without purchase options that expire in May, at which time the Company will exit the marine vessel business.
Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Rowan originally entered the marine vessel business to ensure our customers that a modern fleet was available to service both our drilling rigs and their operations. We believe that commitment has been satisfied, and we are exiting the business with a substantial one-time financial gain.
Simmons & Company International served as financial advisor to Rowan for this transaction.
