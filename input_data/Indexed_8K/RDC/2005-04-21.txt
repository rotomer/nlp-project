Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements, which were approved by the Board of Directors, provide that the Company will indemnify the director or officer to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law in the event that the director or officer is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or investigation, by reason of the director's or officer's relationship with the Company, against all expenses, judgments, fines and penalties, provided that the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, provided he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. However, the Company will not indemnify an officer or director in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the officer or director is adjudged to be liable to the Company, except to the extent determined by the court in which the proceeding is brought or pending. Each indemnification agreement also provides for the advance of expenses, judgments, fines or penalties incurred by an officer or director in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement. The officer or director is to repay the advanced amounts if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the

) is effective as of March 7, 2005, by and among Rowan Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the 
Company
), and ________ (the 
Indemnitee
).
 
WHEREAS, the Indemnitee has been asked to serve [on the Board of Directors of the Company (the 
Board
) and/or as an officer] of the Company;
 
WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify persons serving as [directors and/or officers] of the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve as [directors and/or officers] of the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified;
 
WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to serve and continue to serve [on the Board and/or as an officer] of the Company on the condition that he be so indemnified; and
 
WHEREAS, to the extent permitted by law, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (as amended, the Certificate) and the provisions of the Bylaws of the Company as Amended (the Bylaws) or resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of the Indemnitee thereunder;
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and the Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:
 
Section 1.
  
Services by the Indemnitee
. The Indemnitee agrees to continue to serve at the request of the Company as [a director of the Company (including, without limitation, service on one or more committees of the Board) and/or an officer] of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from any such position.
 
Section 2.
  
Indemnification - - General
. The Company shall indemnify, and advance Expenses (as hereinafter defined) to, the Indemnitee as provided in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in effect on the date hereof and to such greater extent as applicable law may thereafter from time to time permit. The rights of the Indemnitee provided under the preceding sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the rights set forth in the other Sections of this Agreement.
 
Section 3.
  
Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company
. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this
Section 3
if, by reason of his Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding (as hereinafter defined), other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company. Pursuant to this
Section 3
, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, if he also had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.
 
Section 4.
  
Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company
. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this
Section 4
if, by reason of his Corporate Status, he is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this
Section 4
, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which the Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company or if applicable law prohibits such indemnification;
provided
,
however
, that if applicable law so permits, indemnification against Expenses shall nevertheless be made by the Company in such event if and to the extent that the court in which such Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending, shall so determine.
 
Section 5. 
   
  
Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful
.
 
(a)
 
To the extent that the Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. If the Indemnitee is not wholly successful in defense of any Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each such claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee is successful, on the merits or otherwise. For purposes of this
Section 5(a)
, the term successful, on the merits or otherwise, shall include, but shall not be limited to, (i) the termination of any claim, issue or matter in a Proceeding by withdrawal or dismissal, with or without prejudice, (ii) termination of any claim, issue or matter in a Proceeding by any other means without any express finding of liability or guilt against the Indemnitee, with or without prejudice, (iii) the expiration of 120 days after the making of a claim or threat of a Proceeding without the institution of the same and without any promise or payment made to induce a settlement or (iv) the settlement of any claim, issue or matter in a Proceeding pursuant to which the Indemnitee pays less than $200,000. The provisions of this
Section 5(a)
are subject to
Section 5(b)
below.
 
(b)
 
In no event shall the Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification under
Section 5(a)
above with respect to a claim, issue or matter to the extent (i) applicable law prohibits such indemnification, or (ii) an admission is made by the Indemnitee in writing to the Company or in such Proceeding or a final, nonappealable determination is made in such Proceeding that the standard of conduct required for indemnification under this Agreement has not been met with respect to such claim, issue or matter.
 
Section 6.
  
Indemnification for Expenses as a Witness
. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, to the extent that the Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection therewith.
 
Section 7.
  
Advancement of Expenses
. The Company shall advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within 10 days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after the final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee hereby expressly undertakes to repay such amounts advanced, if, but only if, and then only to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined by a final, non-appealable adjudication or arbitration decision that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. All amounts advanced to the Indemnitee by the Company pursuant to this
Section 7
shall be without interest. The Company shall make all advances pursuant to this
Section 7
without regard to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make repayment, without bond or other security and without regard to the prospect of whether the Indemnitee may ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification under the provisions of this Agreement. Any required reimbursement of Expenses by the Indemnitee shall be made by the Indemnitee to the Company within 10 days following the entry of the final, non-appealable adjudication or arbitration decision pursuant to which it is determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. For purposes of any advancement of Expenses for which the Indemnitee has made written demand to the Company in accordance with this
Section 7
, all Expenses included in such demand that are certified by affidavit of the Indemnitees counsel as being reasonable shall be conclusively presumed to be reasonable.
 
Section 8.
  
Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.
 
(a)
  
To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor, along with such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification;
provided
,
however
, that no deficiency in any such request, documentation or information shall adversely affect the Indemnitees rights to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board [of Directors of the Company (the 
Board
)] in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification.
 
(b)
  
Upon written request by the Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of
Section 8(a)
hereof, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the Indemnitees entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case: (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined); or (ii) if a quorum of the Board consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), as selected pursuant to
Section 8(d)
, in a written opinion to the Board (which opinion may be a should hold or a more likely than not opinion), a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee. If it is so determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall make payment to the Indemnitee within 10 days after such determination. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Person or Persons making such determination with respect to the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such Person or Persons upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Subject to the provisions of
Section 10
hereof, any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by the Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Person or Persons making such determination shall be borne by the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
 
(c)
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change of Control has occurred, the Indemnitee may require a determination with respect to the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification to be made by Independent Counsel, as selected pursuant to
Section 8(d)
, in a written opinion to the Board (which opinion may be a should hold or a more likely than not opinion), a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee.
 
(d)
  
In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to
Section 8(b)
or
(c)
hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this
Section 8(d)
. If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board (including a vote of a majority of the Disinterested Directors if obtainable), and the Company shall give written notice to the Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee (unless the Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If (i) an Independent Counsel is to make the determination of entitlement pursuant to
Section 8(b)
or
(c)
hereof, and (ii) within 20 days after submission by the Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8(a)
hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected, either the Company or the Indemnitee may petition the appropriate court of the State (as hereafter defined) or other court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a Person selected by such court or by such other Person as such court shall designate. The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to
Section 8(b)
or
(c)
hereof, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this
Section 8(d)
, regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to
Section 10(a)(iv)
of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
 
Section 9.  
  
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings; Construction of Certain Phrases.
 
(a)
  
In making a determination with respect to whether the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Person(s) making such determination shall presume that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if the Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with
Section 8(a)
of this Agreement, and anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence.
 
(b)
  
Subject to the terms of
Section 16
below, the termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
(c)
  
For purposes of any determination of the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to a criminal Proceeding, to have also had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if the Indemnitees action is based on the records or books of account of the Company or another enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to the Indemnitee by the officers of the Company or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal or financial counsel for the Company or the Board (or any committee thereof) or for another enterprise or its board of directors (or any committee thereof), or on information or records given or reports made by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected by the Company or the Board (or any committee thereof) or by another enterprise or its board of directors (or any committee thereof). For purposes of this
Section 9(c)
, the term another enterprise means any other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which the Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this
Section 9(c)
shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be imputed to the Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this
Section 9(c)
are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that the Indemnitee has acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to a criminal Proceeding, that he also had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence.
 
(d)
  
For purposes of this Agreement, references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan; references to serving at the request of the Company shall include, but shall not be limited to, any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or its beneficiaries; and if the Indemnitee has acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, he shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Company as used in this Agreement. The provisions of this
Section 9(d)
shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
 
Section 10.
  
Remedies of the Indemnitee
.
 
(a)

Section 7
of this Agreement, (iii) the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the Board pursuant to
Section 8(b)
of this Agreement and such determination shall not have been made and delivered to the Indemnitee in writing within twenty (20) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to
Section 8(b)
or
(c)
of this Agreement and such determination shall not have been made in a written opinion to the Board and a copy delivered to the Indemnitee within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (v) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to
Section 6
of this Agreement within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor or (vi) payment of indemnification is not made within 10 days after a determination has been made that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or such determination is deemed to have been made pursuant to
Section 8
or
9
of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of his entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, the Indemnitee, at his sole option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Indemnitee shall commence such Proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which the Indemnitee first has the right to commence such Proceeding pursuant to this
Section 10(a)
;
provided
,
however
, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a Proceeding brought by the Indemnitee to enforce his rights under
Section 5
of this Agreement.
 
(b)
  
In the event that a determination is made pursuant to
Section 8
of this Agreement that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section 10
shall be conducted in all respects as a
de novo
trial or a
de novo
arbitration (as applicable) on the merits, and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section 10
, the Company shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, and the Company shall be precluded from referring to or offering into evidence a determination made pursuant to
Section 8
of this Agreement that is adverse to the Indemnitees right to indemnification. If the Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this
Section 10
, the Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances pursuant to
Section 7
until a final determination is made with respect to the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or have lapsed).
 
(c)
  
If a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to
Section 8
or
9
of this Agreement that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section 10
, absent (i) an intentional misstatement by the Indemnitee of a material fact, or an intentional omission by the Indemnitee of a material fact necessary to make the Indemnitees statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
 
(d)
  
The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section 10
that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement.
 
(e)
  
In the event that the Indemnitee, pursuant to this
Section 10
, seeks a judicial adjudication or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in such judicial adjudication or arbitration, unless the court or arbitrator makes a final determination (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or have lapsed) that each of the Indemnitees claims in such Proceeding were made in bad faith or were frivolous;
provided
,
however
, that until such final determination is made, the Indemnitee shall be entitled under and as provided in
Section 7
to receive payment of Expenses hereunder with respect to such Proceeding. In the event that a Proceeding is commenced by or in the right of the Company against the Indemnitee to enforce or interpret any of the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in such Proceeding (including with respect to any counter-claims or cross-claims made by the Indemnitee against the Company in such Proceeding), unless the court or arbitrator makes a final determination (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or have lapsed) that each of the Indemnitees material defenses in such Proceeding were made in bad faith or were frivolous;
provided
,
however
, that until such final determination is made, the Indemnitee shall be entitled under and as provided in
Section 7
to receive payment of Expenses hereunder with respect to such Proceeding.
 
(f)
  
Any judicial adjudication or arbitration determined under this
Section 10
shall be final and binding on the parties.
 
Section 11.
  
Defense of Certain Proceedings.
In the event the Company shall be obligated under this Agreement to pay the Expenses of any Proceeding against the Indemnitee in which the Company is a co-defendant with the Indemnitee, the Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Proceeding, with counsel approved by the Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, upon the delivery to the Indemnitee of written notice of its election to do so. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Indemnitee shall nevertheless be entitled to employ or continue to employ his own counsel in such Proceeding. Employment of such counsel by the Indemnitee shall be at the cost and expense of the Company unless and until the Company shall have demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the Indemnitee and the Indemnitees counsel that there is complete identity of issues and defenses and no conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in such Proceeding, after which time further employment of such counsel by the Indemnitee shall be at the cost and expense of the Indemnitee. In all events, if the Company shall not, in fact, have timely employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then the fees and Expenses of the Indemnitees counsel shall be at the cost and expense of the Company.
 
Section 12.
  
Exception to Right of Indemnification or Advancement of Expenses
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Agreement with respect to any Proceeding, or any claim therein, brought or made by the Indemnitee against:
 
(a)
  
the Company, except for (i) any claim or Proceeding in respect of this Agreement and/or the Indemnitees rights hereunder, (ii) any claim or Proceeding to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under (A) any statute or law, (B) any other agreement with the Company or (C) the Companys Certificate or Bylaws as now or hereafter in effect and (iii) any counter-claim or cross-claim brought or made by him against the Company in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company against him; or
 
(b)
  
any other Person, except for Proceedings or claims approved by the Board.
 
Section 13.
  
Contribution.
 
(a)
  
If, with respect to any Proceeding, the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to the Indemnitee for any reason other than that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to a criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Company shall contribute to the amount of Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnitee and the relative fault of the Indemnitee versus the other defendants or participants in connection with the action or inaction which resulted in such Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
(b)
  
The Company and the Indemnitee agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 13
were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in
Section 13(a)
above.
 
(c)
  
No Person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
Section 14.
  
Officer and Director Liability Insurance
.
 
(a)
  
The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain in effect during the entire period for which the Company is obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement, one or more policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies to provide the directors and officers of the Company with coverage for losses from wrongful acts and omissions and to ensure the Companys performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement. In all such insurance policies, the Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide the Indemnitee with the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Companys directors and officers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain such insurance if the Company determines in good faith that the Indemnitee is covered by such insurance maintained by a subsidiary or parent of the Company.
 
(b)
  
To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors or officers of any other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise which the Indemnitee serves at the request of the Company, the Indemnitee shall be named as an insured under and shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for the most favorably insured director or officer under such policy or policies.
 
(c)
  
In the event that the Company is a named insured under any policy or policies of insurance referenced in either
Section 14(a)
or
(b)
above, the Company hereby covenants and agrees that it will not settle any claims or Proceedings that may be covered by such policy or policies of insurance and in which the Indemnitee has or may incur Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines or amounts paid in settlement without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee.
 
Section 15.
  
Security.
Upon reasonable request by the Indemnitee, the Company shall provide security to the Indemnitee for the Companys obligations hereunder through an irrevocable bank letter of credit, funded trust or other similar collateral. Any such security, once provided to the Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent may be granted or withheld at the Indemnitees sole and absolute discretion.
 
Section 16.
  
Settlement of Claims
. The Indemnitee hereby agrees that, not less than three (3) business days prior to entering into a settlement of any Proceeding, the Indemnitee shall provide the Company with written notice of such settlement and copies of all documents and agreements related thereto.
 
Section 17.
  
Duration of Agreement
. This Agreement shall be unaffected by the termination of the Corporate Status of the Indemnitee and shall continue for so long as the Indemnitee may have any liability or potential liability by virtue of his Corporate Status, including, without limitation, the final termination of all pending Proceedings in respect of which the Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any Proceeding commenced by the Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 10
of this Agreement relating thereto, whether or not he is acting or serving in such capacity at the time any liability or Expense is incurred for which indemnification can be provided under this Agreement.
