Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
On April 22, 2005, McConnell & Jones LLP was appointed as the independent auditor for the Rowan Companies, Inc. Savings and Investment Plan  and the LeTourneau, Inc. Savings and Investment Plan (the "Plans") for the year ended December 31, 2004.  Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte) had been the Plans' independent auditor for the two most recent fiscal years.
 
The decision to change auditors was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Rowan Companies, Inc. (the "Company") on April 22, 2005.
 
The audit reports of Deloitte on the financial statements of the Plans for the past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
 
During the two most recent fiscal years and through April 22, 2005, there were no disagreements between the Plans and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report on the Plans' financial statements.
 
During the two most recent fiscal years and through April 22, 2005, there were no "reportable events" with respect to the Plans as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation SK.
 
During the two most recent fiscal years and through April 22, 2005, the Company did not consult with McConnell & Jones LLP with respect to the Plans regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation SK.
 
The Plans provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to Deloitte prior to the date of the filing of this report and requested that Deloitte furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements in this Item 4.01. A copy of the letter furnished in response to that request is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8K.
