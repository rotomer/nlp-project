Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2004
 
On July 21, 2004, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Rowan Companies, Inc. (the Company) established the performance goals for the Companys officers and key employees under a short-term incentive compensation plan for fiscal 2004 (the Short-Term Plan").  On July 22, 2004, the Board of Directors approved the Short-Term Plan. The Short-Term Plan included performance goals that were based on the financial performance of the Companys drilling operations, specifically, the percentage of EBITDA return on revenues in excess of a minimum threshhold and relative to budget.  On January 27, 2005, the Committee determined that the performance goals under the Short-Term Plan were achieved, but withheld approval of payment to certain executive officers. The table set forth below reflects annual bonus awards approved by the Committee for fiscal 2004, which were paid in cash to certain executive officers.

Except in the case of terminations of employment due to death, disability, retirement, change of control or other circumstances determined by the Committee, any Full Value Award will not become 100% vested until at least three years from the date of grant, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Long-Term Plan. No awards may be granted under the Long-Term Plan after April 22, 2015. The foregoing description of the Long-Term Plan terms is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the Long-Term Plan, which is attached and incorporated herein by reference.

1.1 Purpose.
This 2005 Rowan Companies, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended from time to time, this
Plan
) is intended to promote the interests of Rowan Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
Company
), and its stockholders by encouraging Employees, Consultants and Non-Employee Directors of the Company or its Affiliates (as defined below) to acquire or increase their equity interests in the Company, thereby giving them an added incentive to work toward the continued growth and success of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the
Board
) also contemplates that through this Plan, the Company and its Affiliates will be better able to compete for the services of the individuals needed for the continued growth and success of the Company. The Plan provides for payment of various forms of incentive compensation, and accordingly, is not intended to be a plan that is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and shall be administered accordingly.

Adjustment of Limitations.
In the event that the number of shares to be delivered upon the exercise or payment of any award granted under the Plan or the Prior Plans is reduced for any reason other than the withholding of shares for the payment of taxes or exercise price, or in the event any award (or portion thereof) granted under the Plan or the Prior Plans can no longer under any circumstances be exercised or paid, the number of shares no longer subject to such award shall thereupon be released from such award and shall thereafter be available under this Plan for the grant of additional Awards including Full Value Awards.

Shares that cease to be subject to an Award because of the exercise of the Award, or the vesting of a Restricted Stock Award or similar Award, shall no longer be subject to or available for any further grant under this Plan.

its Affiliates in respect of any claim, loss, damage or expense (including legal fees) arising therefrom to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
 
1.5 Granting of Awards to Participants.
The Committee shall have the authority to grant, prior to the expiration date of this Plan, Awards to such Employees, Consultants and Non-Employee Directors as may be selected by it, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan. In selecting the persons to receive Awards, including the type and size of the Award, the Committee may consider the contribution the recipient has made and/or may make to the growth of the Company or its Affiliates and any other factors that it may deem relevant. No member of the Committee shall vote or act upon any matter relating solely to himself. Grants of Awards to members of the Committee must be ratified by the Board. In no event shall any Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director, nor his legal representatives, heirs, legatees or distributees have any right to participate in this Plan, except to such extent, if any, as permitted under this Plan and as the Committee may determine.
 
 
1.6 Leave of Absence.
If an employee is on military, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence, such person shall be considered an Employee for purposes of an outstanding Award during the period of such leave, provided that it does not exceed ninety (90) days (or such longer period as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), or, if longer, so long as the persons right to reemployment is guaranteed either by statute or by contract. If the period of leave exceeds ninety (90) days (or such longer period as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), the employment relationship shall be deemed to have terminated on the ninety-first (91st) day (or the first (1st) day immediately following any period of leave in excess of ninety (90) days as approved by the Committee) of such leave, unless the persons right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute or contract.
 
 
1.7 Term of Plan.
If not sooner terminated under the provisions of
Section 1.8
, this Plan shall terminate upon, and no further Awards shall be made, after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date.
 
 
1.8 Amendment and Discontinuance of this Plan.
The Board may amend, suspend or terminate this Plan at any time without prior notice to or consent of any person;
provided
,
however
, that subject to
Section 10.12
, no amendment, suspension or termination of this Plan may, without the consent of the holder of an Award, terminate such Award or adversely affect such persons rights with respect to such Award in any material respect; and
provided
 
further
that no amendment shall be effective prior to its approval by the stockholders of the Company, to the extent such approval is required by applicable legal requirements or the requirements of any securities market or exchange on which the Companys stock is then listed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may amend this Plan in such manner as it deems necessary in order to permit Awards to meet the requirements of the Code or other applicable laws, or to prevent adverse tax consequences to the Participants.
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1 Eligibility.
The Committee may grant Non-Qualified Options to purchase shares of Common Stock to any Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director.

Article II
shall be subject to adjustment as provided in
Section 2.3(f)
of this Plan.
 
 
 
 
2.3 Terms and Conditions of Non-Qualified Options.
Non-Qualified Options shall be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and may contain such additional terms and conditions (including, but not limited to conditions of vesting or exercise of the Options), not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable:
 
 
(a)
Option Period and Conditions and Limitations on Exercise.
No Non-Qualified Option shall be exercisable later than the Option Expiration Date. To the extent not prohibited by other provisions of this Plan, each Non-Qualified Option shall be exercisable at such time or times as the Committee, in its discretion, may determine at the time such Non-Qualified Option is granted.
 
 
(b)
Manner of Exercise.
In order to exercise a Non-Qualified Option, the person or persons entitled to exercise such Non-Qualified Option shall deliver to the Company payment in full for (i) the shares being purchased and (ii) unless other arrangements have been made with the Committee, any required withholding taxes. The payment of the exercise price for each Non-Qualified Option shall either be (x) in cash or by check payable and acceptable to the Company, (y) with the consent of the Committee, which consent may be granted or withheld in the Committees sole discretion, by tendering to the Company shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise that is not greater than the full exercise price for the shares with respect to which the Non-Qualified Option is being exercised and by paying any remaining amount of the exercise price as provided in (x) above or (z) with the consent of the Committee, which may be granted or withheld in the Committees sole discretion, and upon compliance with such instructions as the Committee may specify, at the persons written request, the Company may deliver certificates for the shares of Common Stock for which the Non-Qualified Option is being exercised to a broker for sale on behalf of the person, provided that the person has irrevocably instructed such broker to remit directly to the Company on the persons behalf from the proceeds of such sale the full amount of the exercise price, plus all required withholding taxes. In the event that the person elects to make payment as allowed under clause (y) above, the Committee may, upon confirming that the Optionee owns the number of shares being tendered, authorize the issuance of a new certificate for the number of shares being acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Non-Qualified Option, less the number of shares being tendered upon the exercise and return to the person (or not require surrender of) the certificate for the shares being tendered upon the exercise. If the Committee so requires, such person or persons shall also deliver a written representation that all shares being purchased are being acquired for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution of such shares.
 
 
(c)
Alternative Payment for Stock.
Subject to the consent of the Committee, which may be granted or withheld in the Committees sole discretion and at the election of the Participant, payment of the exercise price or withholding may be made, in whole or in part, with shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Option is being exercised. If payment is to be made in such manner, then the Participant shall deliver to the Company a notice of exercise as to the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Participant as well as the number of shares of Common Stock to be retained by the Company in payment. In such case, the notice of exercise shall include (A) a statement (i) directing the Company to retain the number of shares from the exercise of the Options the Fair Market Value (as of the date of delivery of such notice) of which is equal to the portion of the exercise price and/or withholding with respect to which the Participant intends to make payment, and (ii) confirming the aggregate number of shares to be delivered to the Participant; and (B) such additional payment in cash or shares as shall be necessary, when added to the consideration paid with shares subject to the Option, to pay the exercise price and withholding in full for all such shares. If the Company is required to withhold on account of any federal, state or local tax imposed as a result of an exercise of an Option with previously issued stock or by retention of optioned shares under this Section, the Common Stock surrendered or retained shall include an additional number of shares whose Fair Market Value equals the amount thus required to be withheld at the applicable minimum statutory rate.
 
 
(d)
Proceeds.
The proceeds received from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to exercise of Non-Qualified Options exercised under this Plan will be used for general corporate purposes.
 
 
 
 
(e)
Non-Qualified Options not Transferable.
Except as provided below, no Non-Qualified Option granted hereunder shall be transferable other than by (i) will or by the laws of descent and distribution or (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, and during the lifetime of the Participant to whom any such Non-Qualified Option is granted, it shall be exercisable only by the Participant (or his guardian). The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in an Option Agreement or otherwise that any Non-Qualified Option may be transferred in whole or in part. Any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, or to subject to execution, attachment or similar process, any Non-Qualified Option granted hereunder, or any right thereunder, contrary to the provisions hereof, shall be void and ineffective, shall give no right to the purported transferee and shall, at the sole discretion of the Committee, result in forfeiture of the Non-Qualified Option with respect to the shares involved in such attempt. Any Non-Qualified Option that is transferred in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.3(e)
may only be exercised by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the Non-Qualified Options pursuant to the transfer.

Section 1.3
.
 
 
(g)
Listing and Registration of Shares.
Each Non-Qualified Option shall be subject to the requirement that if at any time the Committee determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares subject to such Non-Qualified Option under any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or purchase of shares thereunder, such Non-Qualified Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained and the same shall have been free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
 
 
2.4 Option Repricing.
With stockholder approval only, the Committee, in its absolute discretion, may grant to holders of outstanding Non-Qualified Options, in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of such Non-Qualified Options, new Non-Qualified Options having exercise prices lower (or higher with any required consent) than the exercise price provided in the Non-Qualified Options so surrendered and canceled and containing such other terms and conditions as the Committee may deem appropriate.

8.1 Performance Awards.
The Committee may grant Performance Awards to Employees, Consultants or Non-employee Directors based on performance criteria measured over a period of not less than six (6) months and not more than ten (10) years. The Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions, and may exercise its discretion to increase the amounts payable under any Award subject to performance conditions, except as limited under
Section 8.2
in the case of a Performance Award which is intended to meet the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code.
 
 
8.2 Performance Goals.
The grant and/or settlement of a Performance Award shall be contingent upon terms set forth in this
Section 8.2
.
 
 
 
 
(a)
General.
The performance goals for Performance Awards shall consist of one or more business criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the Committee. In the case of any Award granted to an Employee, which is intended to meet the requirements of the performance-based exception of section 162(m) of the Code performance goals shall be designed to be objective and shall otherwise meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder (including Treasury Regulations sec. 1.162-27 and successor regulations thereto), including the requirement that the level or levels of performance targeted by the Committee are such that the achievement of performance goals is substantially uncertain at the time of grant. The Committee may determine that such Performance Awards shall be granted and/or settled upon achievement of any one performance goal or that two or more of the performance goals must be achieved as a condition to the grant and/or settlement of such Performance Awards. Performance goals may differ among Performance Awards granted to any one Participant or for Performance Awards granted to different Participants.
 
 
(b)
Business Criteria.
With respect to any Performance Award granted to an Employee which is intended to meet the requirements of the performance-based exception of section 162(m) of the Code, one or more of the following business criteria for the Company, on a consolidated basis, and/or for specified subsidiaries, divisions, businesses, geographical units or individual employees or service providers of the Company (except with respect to the total stockholder return and earnings per share criteria), shall be used by the Committee in establishing performance goals for Performance Awards granted to a Participant: (i) earnings per share; (ii) price per share, (iii) revenues; (iv) cash flow; (v) return on net assets; (vi) return on assets; (vii) return on investment; (viii) return on equity; (ix) economic value added; (x) gross margin; (xi) net income; (xii) pretax earnings; (xiii) pretax earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization; (xiv) pretax operating earnings after interest expense and before incentives, service fees, and extraordinary or special items; (xv) operating income; (xvi) total stockholder return; (xvii) debt reduction; (xviii) safety record; (xix) environmental compliance; and (xx) budget compliance. Any of the above goals may be determined on an absolute or relative basis or as compared to the performance of a published or special index deemed applicable by the Committee including, but not limited to, the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index or components thereof or a group of comparable companies.
 
 
(c)
Performance Period; Timing for Establishing Performance Goals.
Achievement of performance goals in respect of Performance Awards shall be measured over a performance period of not less than six (6) months and not more than ten (10) years, as specified by the Committee. Performance goals in the case of any Award granted to a Participant shall be established not later than ninety (90) days after the beginning of any performance period applicable to such Performance Award, or at such other date as may be required or permitted for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
 
(d)
Settlement of Performance Awards; Other Terms.
After the end of each performance period, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, of Performance Awards payable to each Participant based upon achievement of business criteria over a performance period. The Committee may not exercise discretion to increase any such amount payable in respect of a Performance Award that is intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which such Performance Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of Employment of the Participant prior to the end of a performance period or settlement of Performance Awards.
 
 
(e)
Written Determinations.
All determinations by the Committee as to the establishment of performance goals, the amount of any Performance Award and the achievement of performance goals relating to Performance Awards shall be made in a written agreement or other document covering the Performance Award. The Committee may not delegate any responsibility relating to such Performance Awards.
 
 
(f)
Status of Performance Awards under Section 162(m) of the Code.
It is the intent of the Company that Performance Awards granted to persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be Covered Employees within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder (including Treasury Regulations sec. 1.162-27 and successor regulations thereto) shall constitute performance-based
 
 
 
 
compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the terms of this
Section 8.2
shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the Committee cannot determine with certainty whether a given Participant will be a Covered Employee with respect to a fiscal year that has not yet been completed, the term Covered Employee as used herein shall mean any person designated by the Committee, at the time of grant of a Performance Award, as likely to be a Covered Employee with respect to that fiscal year. If any provision of this Plan as in effect on the date of adoption or any agreements relating to Performance Awards that are intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code or regulations thereunder, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Employees, Non-Employee Directors and Consultants, Other Stock or Performance-Based Awards, which shall consist of a right which (a) is not an Award described in any other Article of this Plan and (b) is denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, units or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock) or cash as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of this Plan. Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Other Stock or Performance-Based Awards, which shall be contained in a written agreement or other document covering such Awards.
 
 
 
 
 
 
10.1 Vesting and Other General Provisions.
Awards shall be evidenced by a written agreement or other document and may be granted on the terms and conditions set forth herein. In addition, the Committee may impose on any Award or the exercise thereof, such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, as the Committee shall determine, including terms requiring forfeiture of Awards in the event of termination of Employment by the Participant and terms permitting a Participant to make elections relating to his or her Award which are not inconsistent with the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except in the case of terminations of employment due to death, Disability, Retirement, Change of Control or such other special circumstances as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine, any Full Value Award under the Plan to an Employee shall not become 100% vested until such Employee has been employed for at least three years from the date of grant. The preceding sentence shall be construed to permit any such Award to vest ratably over such three-year period and to be up to 25% vested immediately upon date of grant. The foregoing vesting requirement shall not apply to (i) Awards to Non-employee Directors or Consultants, (ii) Awards made to Employees not exceeding 5% of the total shares available for Awards as of the Effective Date, or (iii) Awards made contingent upon shareholder approval of the Plan which were authorized by the Companys Compensation Committee prior to the Effective Date. The terms, conditions and/or restrictions contained in an Award may differ from the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in any other Award. The Committee may amend an Award;
provided
,
however
, that, subject to
Section 10.12
, no amendment of an Award may, without the consent of the holder of the Award, adversely affect such persons rights with respect to such Award in any material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may amend any Award without the consent of the holder if the Committee deems it necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences to the holder under Code Section 409A. The Committee shall retain full power and discretion to accelerate or waive, at any time, any term or condition of an Award that is not mandatory under this Plan;
provided
,
however
, that, subject to
Section 10.12
, the Committee shall not have discretion to accelerate or waive any term or condition of an Award (i) if such discretion would cause the Award to have adverse tax consequences
 
 
 
 
 
to the Participant under 409A, or (ii) if the Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code and such discretion would cause the Award not to so qualify. Except in cases in which the Committee is authorized to require other forms of consideration under this Plan, or to the extent other forms of consideration must be paid to satisfy the requirements of the Delaware Corporation Law, no consideration other than services may be required for the grant of any Award.
 
 
10.2 Stand-Alone, Additional, Tandem and Substitute Awards.
Subject to
Section 2.4
of this Plan, Awards granted under this Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or in substitution or exchange for, any other Award or any award granted under another plan of the Company, any Affiliate or any business entity to be acquired by the Company or an Affiliate, or any other right of a Participant to receive payment from the Company or any Affiliate. Such additional, tandem and substitute or exchange Awards may be granted at any time. If an Award is granted in substitution or exchange for another Award, the Committee shall require the surrender of such other Award for cancellation in consideration for the grant of the new Award. In addition, Awards may be granted in lieu of cash compensation, including in lieu of cash amounts payable under other plans of the Company or any Affiliate. Any such action contemplated under this
Section 10.2
shall be effective only to the extent that such action will not cause (a) the holder of the Award to lose the protection of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or (b) any Award that is designed to qualify payments thereunder as performance-based compensation as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code to fail to qualify as such performance-based compensation.
 
 
10.3 Term of Awards.
The term or Restricted Period of each Award that is an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Unit or Restricted Stock shall be for such period as may be determined by the Committee;
provided, however
, that in no event shall the term of any such Award exceed a period of ten (10) years (or such shorter terms as may be required in respect of an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code).
 
 
10.4 Form and Timing of Payment under Awards; Deferrals.
Subject to the terms of this Plan and any applicable Award agreement, payments to be made by the Company or an Affiliate upon the exercise of an Option or other Award or settlement of an Award may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments or on a deferred basis. The settlement of any Award may, subject to any limitations set forth in the Award agreement, be accelerated and cash paid in lieu of shares in connection with such settlement, in the discretion of the Committee or upon occurrence of one or more specified events; provided, however, that such discretion may not be exercised by the Committee if the exercise of such discretion would result in adverse tax consequences to the Participant under section 409A of the Code. In the discretion of the Committee, Awards granted pursuant to
Article VIII
of this Plan may be payable in cash or shares to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Award agreement and the Plan. Installment or deferred payments may be required by the Committee (subject to
Section 1.8
of this Plan, including the consent provisions thereof in the case of any deferral of an outstanding Award not provided for in the original Award agreement); provided, however, that no deferral shall be required or permitted by the Committee if such deferral would result in adverse tax consequences to the Participant under section 409A of the Code. Payments may include, without limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of amounts in respect of installment or deferred payments denominated in shares. Any deferral shall only be allowed as is provided in a separate deferred compensation plan adopted by the Company. The Plan shall not constitute an employee benefit plan for purposes of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
 
 
10.5 Vested and Unvested Awards.
After the satisfaction of all of the terms and conditions set by the Committee with respect to an Award granted to a Participant pursuant to this Plan, the following shall be delivered to such Participant: (a) with respect to an Award of Restricted Stock, a certificate, without the legend set forth in
Section 7.2(c)
, for the number of shares that are no longer subject to such restrictions, terms and conditions; (b) with respect to an Award of Restricted Stock Unit, to the extent not paid in cash, a certificate for the number of shares equal to the number of shares of Common Stock earned; and (c) with
 
 
 
 
respect to an Award of Stock Appreciation Rights or Performance Awards, cash and/or a certificate for the number of shares equal in value to the number of Stock Appreciation Rights or amount of Performance Awards vested. The number of shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right or earning of a Performance Award shall be determined by dividing (1) by (2) where (1) is the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised multiplied by the Spread or the amount of Performance Award that is earned and payable, as applicable, and (2) is the FMV Per Share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right or the date the Performance Award is earned and payable, as applicable. Upon termination, resignation or removal of a Participant under circumstances that do not cause such Participant to become fully vested, any remaining unvested Options, shares of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights or Performance Awards, as the case may be, shall either be forfeited back to the Company or, if appropriate under the terms of the Award, shall continue to be subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions set by the Committee with respect to such Award.
 
 
10.6 Exemptions from Section 16(b) Liability.
It is the intent of the Company that the grant of any Awards to or other transaction by a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to an applicable exemption (except for transactions acknowledged by the Participant in writing to be non-exempt). Accordingly, if any provision of this Plan or any Award agreement does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 as then applicable to any such transaction, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to the applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3 so that such Participant shall avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.
 
 
10.7 Securities Requirements.
No shares of Common Stock will be issued or transferred pursuant to an Award unless and until all then-applicable requirements imposed by federal and state securities and other laws, rules and regulations and by any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction and by any stock market or exchange upon which the Common Stock may be listed, have been fully met. As a condition precedent to the issuance of shares pursuant to the grant or exercise of an Award, the Company may require the grantee to take any reasonable action to meet such requirements. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the issuance or transfer of shares pursuant to an Award to comply with any law or regulation described in the second preceding sentence.
 
 
10.8 Transferability.
 
 
 
(a)
Non-Transferable Awards and Options.
Except as may be otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award agreement or otherwise, no Award and no right under this Plan, contingent or otherwise, other than Purchased Stock, Bonus Stock or Restricted Stock as to which restrictions have lapsed, will be (i) assignable, saleable or otherwise transferable by a Participant except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order or (ii) subject to any encumbrance, pledge or charge of any nature. No transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with a copy of the deceased Participants will or such other evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer. Any attempted transfer in violation of this
Section 10.8(a)
shall be void and ineffective for all purposes.
 
 
(b)
Ability to Exercise Rights.
Except as otherwise specifically provided under this Plan, only the Participant or his guardian (if the Participant becomes Disabled), or in the event of his death, his legal representative or beneficiary, may exercise Options, receive cash payments and deliveries of shares or otherwise exercise rights under this Plan. The executor or administrator of the Participants estate, or the person or persons to whom the Participants rights under any Award will pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall be deemed to be the Participants beneficiary or beneficiaries of the rights of the Participant hereunder and shall be entitled to exercise such rights as are provided hereunder.
 
 
 
 
10.9 Rights as a Stockholder.
 
 
 
(a)
No Stockholder Rights.
Except as otherwise provided in
Section 10.9(b)
, a Participant who has received a grant of an Award or a transferee of such Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock until such person becomes the holder of record. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 10.9(b)
, no adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other property) or distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.
 
 
(b)
Holder of Restricted Stock.
Unless otherwise approved by the Committee prior to the grant of a Restricted Stock Award, a Participant who has received a grant of Restricted Stock or a permitted transferee of such Participant shall not have any rights of a stockholder until such time as a stock certificate has been issued with respect to all, or a portion of, such Restricted Stock Award.
 
 
10.10 Listing and Registration of Shares of Common Stock.
The Company, in its discretion, may postpone the issuance and/or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon any exercise of an Award until completion of such stock exchange listing, registration or other qualification of such shares under any state and/or federal law, rule or regulation as the Company may consider appropriate, and may require any Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of the shares in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
 
 
10.11 Termination of Employment, Death and Disability.
 
 
 
(a)
Termination of Employment.
Except as otherwise provided in (b) below, and unless otherwise provided in the Award, if Employment of an Employee or service of a Non-Employee Director or Consultant is terminated for any reason whatsoever, any nonvested Award granted pursuant to this Plan outstanding at the time of such termination and all rights thereunder shall wholly and completely terminate and no further vesting shall occur, and the Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director shall be entitled to exercise his or her rights with respect to the portion of the Award vested as of the date of termination for a period that shall end on the earlier of (i) the expiration date set forth in the Award with respect to the vested portion of such Award or (ii) the date that occurs six (6) months after such termination date (three (3) months after the date of termination in the case of an Incentive Option).
 
 
(b)
Continuation.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide for the acceleration of vesting upon death, Disability or Retirement or for the continuation of any Award for such period and upon such terms and conditions as are determined by the Committee in the event that a Participant ceases to be an Employee, Consultant or Non-Employee Director.
 
 
10.12 Change in Control.
 
 
 
(a)
Change in Control.
Unless otherwise provided in the Award, in the event of a Change in Control described in the definition of Change in Control under
Section 1.2
of this Plan:
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the above provisions of this
Section 10.12(a)
, the Committee shall not be required to take any action described in the preceding provisions of this
Section 10.12(a)
, and any decision made by the Committee, in its sole discretion, not to take some or all of the actions described in the preceding provisions of this
Section 10.12(a)
shall be final, binding and conclusive with respect to the Company, all Participants and all other interested persons.
 
 
(b)
Right of Cash-Out.
If approved by the Board prior to or within thirty (30) days after such time as a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred, the Board shall have the right for a forty-five (45) day period immediately following the date that the Change in Control is deemed to have occurred to require all, but not less than all, Participants to transfer and deliver to the Company all Awards previously granted to the Participants in exchange for an amount equal to the cash value (defined below) of the Awards. Such right shall be exercised by written notice to all Participants. For purposes of this
Section 10.12(b)
, the cash value of an Award shall equal the sum of (i) all cash to which the Participant would be entitled upon settlement or exercise of any Award which is not an Option and (ii) in the case of any Award that is an Option, the excess of the market value (defined below) per share over the Option price, if any, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such Award. For purposes of the preceding sentence, market value per share shall mean the higher of (x) the average of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on each of the five (5) trading days immediately following the date a Change in Control is deemed to have occurred or (y) the highest price, if any, offered in connection with the Change in Control. The amount payable to each Participant by the Company pursuant to this
Section 10.12(b)
shall be paid in cash or by certified check and shall be reduced by any taxes required to be withheld.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option or in payment of any other Award under this Plan shall not be made until appropriate arrangements satisfactory to the Company have been made for the payment of any tax amounts (federal, state, local or other) that may be required to be withheld or paid by the Company with respect thereto. Such arrangements may, at the discretion of the Committee, include allowing the person to tender to the Company shares of Common Stock owned by the person, or to request the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock being acquired pursuant to the Award, whether through the exercise of an Option or as a distribution pursuant to the Award, which have an aggregate FMV Per Share as of the date of such withholding that is not greater than the sum of all tax amounts to be withheld with respect thereto at the minimum statutory rate, together with payment of any remaining portion of such tax amounts in cash or by check payable and acceptable to the Company.
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on the date of an event giving rise to a tax withholding obligation on the part of the Company the person is an officer or individual subject to Rule 16b-3, such person may direct that such tax withholding be effectuated by the Company withholding the necessary number of shares of Common Stock (at the minimum statutory tax rate) from such Award payment or exercise.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.1 No Rights to Awards or Uniformity Among Awards.
No Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award; there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards; and the terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
 
12.2 Conflicts with Plan.
In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the terms of this Plan and an Award, the terms of this Plan shall govern.
 
 
12.3 No Right to Employment.
The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or any Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim under this Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Plan or in any Award.
 
 
12.4 Governing Law.
The validity, construction and effect of this Plan and any rules and regulations relating to this Plan shall be determined in accordance with applicable federal law and the laws of the State of Texas with venue in Harris County, without regard to any principles of conflicts of law.
 
 
12.5 Gender, Tense and Headings.
Whenever the context requires such, words of the masculine gender used herein shall include the feminine and neuter, and words used in the singular shall include the plural. Section headings as used herein are inserted solely for convenience and reference and constitute no part of this Plan.
 
 
12.6 Severability.
If any provision of this Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Participant or Award, or would disqualify this Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended as necessary to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of this Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Participant or Award, and the remainder of this Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
 
 
12.7 Other Laws.
The Committee may refuse to issue or transfer any shares or other consideration under an Award if, acting in its sole discretion, it determines that the issuance or transfer of such shares or such other consideration might violate any applicable law.
 
 
12.8 Stockholder Agreements.
The Committee may condition the grant, exercise or payment of any Award upon such person entering into a stockholders or repurchase agreement in such form as approved from time to time by the Board.
 
 
12.9 Funding.
Except as provided under
Article VII
of this Plan, no provision of this Plan shall require or permit the Company, for the purpose of satisfying any obligations under this Plan, to purchase assets or place any assets in a trust or other entity to which contributions are made or otherwise to segregate any assets, nor shall the Company maintain separate bank accounts, books, records or other evidence of the existence of a segregated or separately maintained or administered fund for such purposes. Participants shall have no rights under this Plan other than as unsecured general creditors of the Company, except that insofar as they may have become entitled to payment of additional compensation by performance of services, they shall have the same rights as other Employees, Consultants or Non-Employee Directors under general law.
 
 
12.10 No Guarantee of Tax Consequences.
Neither the Board, nor the Company nor the Committee makes any commitment or guarantee that any federal, state or local tax treatment will apply or be available to any person participating or eligible to participate hereunder.
