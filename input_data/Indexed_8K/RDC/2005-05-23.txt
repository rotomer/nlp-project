Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2005
 
On May 9, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Rowan Companies, Inc. (the Company) established the performance goals for the Companys officers and key employees for fiscal 2005 under two integrated short-term incentive compensation plans, a broad-based profit sharing plan (the Profit Sharing Plan) and a targeted bonus plan (the Bonus Plan). Any awards under the Bonus Plan will only be made after the Profit Sharing Plan has been fully funded, and Bonus Plan awards to individual employees are first reduced by Profit Sharing Plan payouts. On May 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the Profit Sharing Plan and Bonus Plan.
 
The 2005 short-term incentive compensation performance goals are based on the results of the Companys drilling operations, specifically, the percentage of EBITDA return on revenues in excess of a minimum threshold (with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan) and relative to budget (with respect to the Bonus Plan). Each participant of the Bonus Plan has an aggregate incentive target that is a percentage of the participants base salary. The amount of the aggregate payment under the Bonus Plan could range from zero to 200% of the incentive target, depending upon the extent to which the performance goals are met or exceeded. Between 60-75% of any aggregate payment under the Bonus Plan will be determined in this manner, whereas the remaining 25-40% is subject to the discretion of the Committee. The aggregate incentive targets established under the Bonus Plan for certain of the executive officers of the Company are set forth in the table below.
 
 
A summary of each of the Profit Sharing Plan and Bonus Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2005
 
On May 9, 2005, the Committee approved awards of stock options and restricted stock to the Companys officers and certain key employees under the 2005 Rowan Companies, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Long-Term Plan) and established performance criteria governing the potential award of additional common stock (the Performance Shares). On May 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the awards and performance criteria recommended by the Committee. Pursuant to the Long-Term Plan, the stock options and restricted stock awarded to each participant vest in 25% increments over a four-year service period and the option exercise price was set at the mean of the high and low per-share sales price on the New York Stock Exchange on May 16, 2005. The awards of stock options and restricted stock made to certain of the executive officers of the Company under the Long-Term Plan are set forth in the table below.
The number of Performance Shares ultimately awarded, if any, is contingent upon the Companys total shareholder return over the three-year period ending on May 17, 2008, relative to a peer group of public companies comparable to the Company. Performance Shares awarded to the individuals listed above can range from zero to 200% of a predetermined target, with the maximum awards as follows: McNease - 62,800 shares, Croyle - 33,400 shares, Kelly - 8,400 shares, Buvens - 21,000 shares, Keller - 21,000, Russell - 18,800 and Wells - 16,800.
The Long-Term Plan was filed via Form 8-K on May 10, 2005 and is incorporated herein by reference.
