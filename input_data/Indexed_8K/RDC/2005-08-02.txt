Our fleet utilization has remained near optimal levels for most of the past 12 months, and many of our 25 offshore and 16for premium drilling equipment is strong throughout the world, and most jack-up markets, including the Gulf of Mexico, are competing for rigs. We believe that this competition will intensify in the months ahead, and that jack-up day rates will continue to increase and contracts will continue to lengthen.

As announced today, we have obtained a three-year contract for five jack-ups in the Middle East to begin in early 2006. has concluded abandonment activities on the North Seas Ardmore Field, and should commence its one-year contract in Denmark this month.

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Rowan Companies, Inc. (RDC-NYSE) announced today that it has been awarded a term drilling contract by the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi ARAMCO) for five Class 116-C jack-up drilling rigs to begin operating offshore Saudi Arabia in early 2006.
The contract is for a three-year term and contains options for one additional year. Each rig is currently under contract in the Gulf of Mexico. The relocation of rigs to the Middle East will begin late in the fourth quarter of this year and should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2006.
 
Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are extremely pleased to be returning to the Middle East and look forward to renewing our relationship with Saudi ARAMCO. I want to personally thank Rawabi Trading & Contracting Co. Ltd. who greatly assisted Rowan in this endeavor. This contract will bring more global diversification to Rowans drilling operations and, over time, should improve the average return on our investments. However, Rowan remains very committed to the Gulf of Mexico and we believe that this contract will also improve business conditions for our 17 offshore rigs that are currently slated to remain in that market.
