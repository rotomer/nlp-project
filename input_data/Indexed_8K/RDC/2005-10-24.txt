PURCHASE PRICE
3.1
 
(a) The purchase price for the Vessel is SIXTY MILLION US DOLLARS ($60,000,000) (the Gross Purchase Price). The Gross Purchase Price shall be subject to reduction as provided for in Section 3.2 of this Agreement to determine the net purchase price (the Net Purchase Price), which shall be the amount to be paid by
 
-3-
 
 Buyer to Seller on the Final Payment Date. Ancillary Items (other than with respect to the Excluded Drilling Equipment and the Software) are included in the sale of the Vessel and no amounts over and above the Net Purchase Price as calculated herein shall be paid by Buyer to Seller on the Final Payment Date (as defined below) to acquire the Vessel; provided that on the Final Payment Date Buyer shall pay Seller, in addition to the Net Purchase Price, all undisputed amounts owed (if any) Seller under the Charter Agreement and the Marine Services Agreement.
(b)
 
Upon execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Seller TEN MILLION US DOLLARS ($10,000,000) as a deposit on the Gross Purchase Price (the Performance Deposit), which is nonrefundable except as provided in Section 4.8 or Section 13.1.
(c)
 
Upon execution of this Agreement and in addition to the Performance Deposit, Buyer shall pay Seller for fuel on board the Vessel as of the start of the Drilling Contract on August 3, 2005. As of August 3, 2005, the fuel on board the Vessel amounted to 78,876 gallons of diesel fuel at an assumed price of $1.7952 per gallon. As a result, Buyer will pay Seller $141,598.20. This amount shall not reduce or otherwise impact the Gross Purchase Price or the Net Purchase Price.
(d)
 
Upon execution of this Agreement and in addition to the Performance Deposit, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of $120,715.20 for placement of the insurance as specified in Section 6(l) of the Charter Agreement. This amount shall not reduce the Gross Purchase Price or the Net Purchase Price.
3.2
 
In determining the Net Purchase Price, there shall be deducted from the Gross Purchase Price the aggregate amount of all Interim Payments made by Buyer pursuant to Section 4.3, the amount of the Performance Deposit, and the amount of any insurance proceeds paid to Seller for damage or loss of the Vessel pursuant to Article 6(c)(2)(B) of the Charter Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Gross Purchase Price is all inclusive and no taxes, fees, charges, duties or amounts of any other nature are applicable to the sale of the Vessel; provided that to the extent that any such taxes, fees, charges, duties or other amounts are by law payable by Buyer or are owed in connection with the sale of the Vessel, such amounts shall be in addition to the Gross Purchase Price and shall be paid by Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer agrees that if the Vessel is not located beyond state territorial waters in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on the Final Payment Date, Buyer shall pay any resulting sales tax.

At the time of the Closing, Buyer will have made a payment in accordance with Section 806 of the Drilling Contract for the monthly advance payment required in Section 806 for the month in which Closing occurs.

4.4
 
The Net Purchase Price shall be due and payable from Buyer to Seller on January 31, 2007; provided that Buyer shall have the right, in Buyers sole discretion and without penalty of any kind, to pay the Net Purchase Price at any time prior to January 31, 2007, upon 30 days prior written notice to Seller, and the date on which the Net Purchase Price is paid shall be referred to in this Agreement as the Final Payment Date. Subject to Section 3.2, payment of the Net Purchase Price to Seller by Buyer shall constitute a full and complete discharge of any obligation of Buyer with respect to the payment of any amounts constituting the Gross Purchase Price or the Net Purchase Price. Simultaneously with payment of the Net Purchase Price, title to the Vessel shall pass to Buyer and Seller shall deliver the documentation and other items provided for in Section 10.
4.5
 
At least 30 days prior to the Final Payment Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller the Buyers estimate as to the amount of the Net Purchase Price to be paid on the Final Payment Date, as well as any amount owed (if any) to Seller under the Charter Agreement or the Marine Services Agreement. Such estimate shall take into account all Interim Payments expected to be paid prior to the Final Payment Date to be subtracted from the Gross Purchase Price. Within 10 days of receipt of such estimate, Seller shall advise Buyer of its agreement with such estimate or if not in agreement, Seller shall advise specifically the items of such estimate with which Seller is not in agreement. Buyer may, at its sole discretion, pay the amount which Seller calculates as the Net Purchase Price and receive immediately title to the Vessel without waiving its objections or the rights to recovery with respect to Sellers calculation of the Net Purchase Price. As to any disagreement regarding the Net Purchase Price, the parties shall promptly enter into discussions to attempt to resolve any differences. The parties acknowledge that Buyer will be providing only an estimate of the Net Purchase Price and the Net Purchase Price shall be calculated with reference to the actual amounts to be deducted from the Gross Purchase Price as determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
4.6
 
If Buyer refuses or is unable for any reason (including failure to obtain financing) to pay the Net
 
Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, other than due to an exercise of Buyer's rights under Article 13, Seller shall be entitled to exercise either of the following remedies:
(a) It is specifically agreed that due to the unique nature and use of the Vessel as an FOI and the irreparable damages both parties agree that Seller will suffer should Buyer fail to perform its obligations under this Agreement, Seller may in its sole and exclusive discretion exercise all remedies available to it at law or in equity for any failure by Buyer to consummate the sale of the Vessel in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Accordingly, Buyer agrees that specific performance and injunctive relief, alone or in combination, are appropriate remedies for any breach of this Agreement by Buyer in connection with Buyer's obligation to consummate the sale of the Vessel as provided in this Agreement and that Seller may obtain specific performance or injunctive relief without proof of actual damages or the posting of a bond and any court of competent jurisdiction is specifically authorized to order specific performance, grant injunctive relief or any other remedy necessary or appropriate to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The granting of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other remedy shall be without prejudice to any other claim or remedy Seller may have for Buyer's breach of this Agreement.
 
 
-6-
 
(b) Alternatively, Seller may in its sole discretion (1) retain the Performance Deposit and all Interim Payments made by Buyer to Seller as agreed liquidated damages and not as a penalty, (2) retain title to the Vessel without any further obligation to Buyer, and (3) terminate the Charter Agreement and Marine Services Agreement. In such case Seller shall have no further recourse of any nature whatsoever against Buyer. Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge and agree that Seller would be damaged by such breach of this Agreement by Buyer, that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damages incurred by Seller resulting from such breach, and that such liquidated damages specified in this Section 4.6(b) are a fair and reasonable estimate of the damages.
(c) Regardless of
 
which remedy Seller exercises, Buyer shall deliver to Seller copies of all then existing drawings and documentation relating to Buyer's conversion of the Vessel to an FOI that have not previously been provided to Seller. Notwithstanding such delivery, such documents shall remain the property of Buyer.
4.7
 
It is specifically agreed that due to the unique nature and use of the Vessel as an FOI and the irreparable damages that both Parties agree that Buyer will suffer should Seller fail to perform its obligations under this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to all remedies available to it at law and in equity for any breach by Seller of Seller's obligation to transfer title to the Vessel to Buyer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, Seller agrees that specific performance and injunctive relief, alone or in combination, are appropriate remedies for any breach of this Agreement by Seller in connection with Sellers obligation to transfer title to Buyer as provided for in this Agreement and that Buyer may obtain specific performance or injunctive relief without proof of actual damages or the posting of a bond and any court of competent jurisdiction is specifically authorized to order specific performance, grant injunctive relief or any other remedy necessary or appropriate to carry out the transfer of the Vessel as contemplated by this Agreement. The granting of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other remedy shall be without prejudice to any other claim or remedy Buyer may have for Sellers breach of this Agreement.
4.8
 
Alternatively to Section 4.7, if Seller refuses, or is unable for any reason, to execute the bill of sale and transfer title to the Vessel to Buyer upon Buyers tender of the Net Purchase Price to Seller, then Buyer shall have (i) the right to receive a refund of the Performance Deposit (but not the Interim Payments) and (ii) the option to terminate this Agreement and continue to operate under the Charter Agreement for the duration of Buyer's operations in the Mississippi Canyon Block area subject to renegotiation of the rates for operations after January 31, 2009.
4.9
Prior to and following the Closing, Seller shall make a reasonable number of its personnel available to Buyer to respond to questions or provide information with respect to the Vessel as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the transition of possession of the Vessel to Buyer.
4.10
In the event that Seller determines that, as a result of the Vessel's operations following the Closing Date in state waters, a tax payment is due to a taxing authority or receives an assessment of tax from a taxing authority, Seller will notify Buyer of such tax and Buyer will be responsible for the payment of such tax.
5.
 
DELIVERY LOCATION/CONDITION OF VESSEL
5.1
 
On the Closing Date, pursuant to the Charter Agreement, Seller shall turn
 
-7-
 
 over possession of the Vessel to Buyer or Buyers designated representative (it being understood that such designated representative may be Seller or an affiliate thereof pursuant to the Marine Services Agreement). Delivery of the Vessel shall be at the then current location of the Vessel or the various components thereof, or such other location as may be mutually agreed (the Delivery Location).
5.2
 
As of the Closing Date, the Drilling Unit is under construction pursuant to the Drilling Contract for conversion of the Drilling Unit from a MODU to a FOI. Following the Closing Date, Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer shall have the right to continue to modify the Drilling Unit for use as an FOI. Buyer hereby acknowledges that in the event the Drilling Unit has any outstanding recommendations from ABS for repairs or maintenance and/or outstanding surveys, Buyer hereby accepts the Drilling Unit with such outstanding recommendations and/or outstanding surveys, and Seller is not obligated to take any action regarding such outstanding recommendations and/or outstanding surveys. At Closing, Seller shall deliver the Vessel to Buyer under the Charter Agreement as is, where is, with all faults and defects at the Delivery Location. The Vessel shall have valid documentation as required by the ABS and the United States Coast Guard, as applicable. This sale does not include any shipyard modification services and Buyer assumes full responsibility for such.
 
5.3
 
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SALE OF THE VESSEL PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS AS IS, WHERE IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS, PATENT, LATENT OR OTHERWISE. SELLER MAKES NO GUARANTY, WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE QUALITY, SERVICEABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR CONDITION OF THE VESSEL, OR ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE. BUYER AGREES THAT NO GUARANTY, WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION HAS BEEN EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SELLER AND THAT BUYER, PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE, HAS HAD FULL OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE VESSEL AND UNDERSTANDS THAT SUCH VESSEL IS BEING PURCHASED ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS" BASIS. SELLER MAKES NO GUARANTY, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE CONVERSION OF THE DRILLING UNIT FROM A MODU TO A FOI.
 
6.1
 
Seller shall, at Sellers cost (except as provided below), remove the Excluded Drilling Equipment; provided, however, that:
(a) removal of such Excluded Drilling Equipment shall not involve cutting or other modifications of the Vessel that would compromise the structural integrity of the Vessel, in Buyers sole and reasonable opinion;
(b) Seller shall repair and/or re-paint any damaged coating resulting from removal of the Excluded Drilling Equipment to Seller's existing standards;
(c) all reasonable third party costs incurred by Seller to remove the Excluded Drilling Equipment (i.e., a crane barge to remove the mast) shall be for the account of Buyer, and Buyer shall pay such costs within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from Seller properly documenting such third party costs; and
 
 
-8-
(d) if all or any part of the Excluded Drilling Equipment has not been removed by such time as Buyer is ready to mobilize the Vessel to its intended offshore location, Seller shall be deemed to have waived its right to remove the Excluded Drilling Equipment and such remaining equipment shall be included in the sale and purchase of the Vessel.
6.2
 
Immediately following the Closing, Seller shall commence removing the Excluded Drilling Equipment and shall prosecute such operations with due diligence through to completion. Seller agrees that, to the extent possible, such equipment shall be removed using equipment at Sellers yard in Sabine Pass, Texas.
6.3
 
To the extent that:
(a) the Software is licensed from third parties, and Buyer obtains its own license to such third party Software prior to the termination of the Marine Services Agreement, or
(b) the Software is proprietary to Seller, and Seller and Buyer negotiate a license or licenses to such proprietary Software prior to the termination of the Marine Services Agreement,
then Seller shall not remove such Software from the Vessel upon termination of the Marine Services Agreement. Otherwise, Seller shall remove the Software from the Vessel upon termination of the Marine Services Agreement.
7.
 
WARRANTY OF TITLE; NO LIENS OR ENCUMBRANCES
At the time of Closing and on the Final Payment Date, Seller warrants, covenants and agrees that the Seller is the sole owner of the Vessel, that the Seller has good and marketable title to the Vessel, and that the Vessel is free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, mortgages and debts of any nature whatsoever (other than Buyers Liens). Seller covenants that during the Interim Period, Seller shall not sell, bargain, convey or assign the Vessel, nor permit any lien, encumbrance, mortgage or debt of any nature to be placed thereon (other than Buyers Liens), such that upon payment of the Net Purchase Price on the Final Payment Date, Seller shall deliver good and marketable title to the Vessel to Buyer, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, mortgages and debts of any nature whatsoever (other than Buyers Liens) and the bill(s) of sale delivered pursuant to Section 10.1 shall contain such a warranty. If Seller shall breach the foregoing covenant not to permit any lien, encumbrance, mortgage or debt of any nature to be placed on the Vessel, it will promptly take such action as shall be necessary to release or discharge such lien, encumbrance, mortgage or debt (if such is not being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings and there is no risk that Buyer's right to purchase the Vessel will be interfered with or interrupted), and if Seller fails to promptly take such action, Buyer may, but shall have no obligation to, take such action as shall be necessary to release or discharge the same at Seller's expense. The warranty given pursuant to this Section 7 and in the bill(s) of sale shall survive the Closing and the Final Payment Date.
