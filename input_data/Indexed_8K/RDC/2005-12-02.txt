FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                         December 2, 2005
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
HOUSTON, TEXAS -Rowan Companies, Inc. (NYSE: RDC) today announced plans for the construction of two jack-up rigs to add to its offshore fleet. The rigs will be a new design called the LeTourneau 240C. This design has enhanced environmental and drilling capabilities to meet the ever increasing operational requirements of worldwide exploration and production. Each rig will cost approximately $165 million and will be constructed at Rowans Vicksburg, Mississippi facility. Expected delivery of the first rig is early summer 2008, and the second in early 2009. Rowan currently anticipates funding construction with available cash, but will consider attractive financing alternatives.
 
The 240C rigs will have up to 535 feet of leg length, enabling operations in water depths of up to 400 feet, and are designed for high pressure/high temperature drilling. Compared to the 116C design, the 240C rigs will have more deck space, higher variable load, more drilling capacity (two million pound hook-load capability), more cantilever reach (up to 85 feet) and increased personnel on board (120 man). The 240C design will set a new standard as a replacement for the industrys current fleet of 116C rigs, which has been the workhorse of the global drilling industry for the past 25 years.
Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, The construction of these rigs, utilizing the resources of our manufacturing division, will accelerate the process of replacing our rigs lost in the recent hurricanes, and will further enhance our fleet of technically superior jack-up drilling rigs operating in niche markets. The construction of the two 240C rigs, together with the previously announced and will provide us with rig deliveries in each of 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. By summer 2006, we will also have nine new land rigs working under term contracts at very attractive day rates. This expansion and acceleration of our construction program will greatly enhance our asset and revenue base and further strengthen our market position.
