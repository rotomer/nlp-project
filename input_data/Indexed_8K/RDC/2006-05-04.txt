Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2005
 
On March 10, 2006 and March 28, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) approved the bonus calculations for certain executive officers. The final determination and approval for certain of such awards was completed by the Board in its April 28, 2006 meeting. The table below reflects annual bonus awards for fiscal 2005, which were paid in cash to certain executive officers.
 
 
 
 
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2006
On April 27, 2006, the Committee established the performance goals for the Companys officers and key employees for fiscal 2006 under two integrated short-term incentive compensation plans, a broad-based profit sharing plan (the Profit Sharing Plan) and a targeted bonus plan (the Bonus Plan). Any awards under the Bonus Plan will only be made after the Profit Sharing Plan has been fully funded, and Bonus Plan awards to individual employees are first reduced by Profit Sharing Plan payouts. On April 28, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Profit Sharing Plan and Bonus Plan.
 
The 2006 short-term incentive compensation performance goals are based in part on the results of the Companys drilling operations, specifically, the percentage of EBITDA return on revenues in excess of a minimum threshold (with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan) and relative to budget (with respect to the Bonus Plan). Each participant in the Bonus Plan has an aggregate incentive target that is a percentage of the participants base salary.
The amount of the aggregate payment under the Bonus Plan could range from zero to 200% of the participants incentive target. Payout will be determined as follows:

The aggregate incentive targets established under the Bonus Plan for certain of the executive officers of the Company are set forth in the table below.
 
 
A summary of each of the Profit Sharing Plan and Bonus Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2006
On April 27, 2006, the Committee approved awards of stock options and restricted stock to the Companys officers and certain key employees under the 2005 Rowan Companies, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) and established performance criteria governing the potential award of additional common stock (the Performance Shares). On April 28, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the awards and performance criteria recommended by the Committee. All stock options awarded vest in 33% increments over a three-year service period and the option exercise price was set at the mean of the high and low per-share sales price on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on April 27, 2006. Restricted stock awards granted to Messrs. McNease and Croyle cliff vest at the end of the third year from the dates of grant. Restricted stock granted to all other officers vest in 33% increments over a three-year service period. The awards of stock options and restricted stock made to certain of the executive officers of the Company under the LTIP are set forth in the table below.

The number of Performance Shares ultimately awarded, if any, is contingent upon the Companys achievement of the following two metrics: (1) 50% will be determined based on total shareholder return over the three-year period ending on April 28, 2009, relative to a peer group of public companies comparable to the Company and (2) 50 % will be determined based on return on investment over the three-year period ending on April 28, 2009, relative to a peer group of public companies comparable to the Company. Performance Shares awarded to the individuals listed above can range from zero to 200% of a predetermined target, with the maximum awards as follows: McNease - 59,276 shares, Croyle - 33,344 shares, Buvens - 18,442 shares, Keller - 18,442 shares, Russell - 18,442 shares and Wells - 18,112 shares.
 
 
2006 Awards - Non-Employee Directors
On April 28, 2006, certain non-employee directors of the Company received a grant of Restricted Stock Units under the LTIP.  The units become fully vested as of the date of the Companys next annual meeting of stockholders, but are payable in stock or cash only upon termination of service.
 
The Long-Term Plan was filed via Form 8-K on May 10, 2005 and is incorporated herein by reference.
