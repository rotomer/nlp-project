Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Profit Sharing Payout for Fiscal 2006
 
On April 26, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors established certain performance goals for the Companys officers and key employees for fiscal 2006 under a broad based profit sharing plan (the Profit Sharing Plan). The goals were based on the percentage of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) return on revenues in excess of a minimum threshold for the Companys drilling operations.
On January 18, 2007, the Board of Directors approved the payment of the Companys profit sharing plan in accordance with its terms for fiscal year 2006. The 2006 Profit Sharing Plan payout is at its maximum given that the Companys operating results are expected to far exceed the highest threshold of 35% of EBITDA margin in 2006. The total pool is approximately $6.8 million, and will be paid to approximately 380 employees. Under the terms of the Profit Sharing Plan, each eligible employee will receive the maximum (20% of his or her base pay).
The table below reflects the payments to be made to certain executive officers under the plan. Payment will be made in cash and is expected to be paid before January 26, 2007.
 
 
 
Restricted Stock Awards - Directors
On January 17, 2007, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of 1,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan to each of Mr. Robert G. Croyle and Mr. Robert E. Kramek. The Board approved such grants on January 18, 2007. Mr. Croyle recently retired as an employee of the Company but remains as a director. Mr. Robert E. Kramek was elected to the Board on January 18, 2007. Under the terms of the RSU grant, the units become fully vested on the date of our next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but are payable in stock or cash only upon termination of service.
 
The Long-Term Incentive Plan was filed via Form 8-K on May 10, 2005 and is incorporated herein by reference.
