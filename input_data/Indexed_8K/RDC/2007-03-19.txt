Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2006
 
The following bonus awards for fiscal 2006 were approved and are to be paid in cash before April 1, 2007. These amounts are in addition to profit sharing amounts paid in January 2007 and reported on Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 25, 2007.
 
__________________________________________________
(1) Mr. Croyle retired from the Company on December 31, 2006.
 
 
Base Salary Adjustments for 2007
The following new base salaries were approved and are effective as of April 1, 2007.
 
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2007
The Companys two integrated 2007 short-term incentive compensation plans (a broad-based profit sharing plan and a targeted bonus plan) were also reviewed by the Committee. Any awards under the Bonus Plan will only be made after the Profit Sharing Plan has been fully paid.
 
As in 2006, the 2007 short-term incentive compensation performance goals are based in part on the results of the Companys drilling operations, specifically, the percentage of EBITDA return on revenues in excess of a minimum threshold (with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan) and relative to budget (with respect to the Bonus Plan).
 
 
 
Each participant in the Bonus Plan has an aggregate incentive target that is a percentage of the participants base salary. The terms of the plan are the same as fiscal 2006 as described in Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 28, 2006, provided that the EBITDA goal used for both plans was revised for 2007.
The following officers have the aggregate incentive targets set forth below.
 
 
A summary of each of the Profit Sharing Plan and Bonus Plan was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 28, 2006 and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
