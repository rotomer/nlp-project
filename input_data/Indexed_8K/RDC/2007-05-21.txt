Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
 
The Commentary to Section 303A.03 of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Listed Company Manual requires each listed company to disclose in its proxy statement either the name of the director chosen to preside at executive sessions of non-management directors or, if the same individual is not the presiding director at all executive sessions, the procedure by which a presiding director is selected for each executive session.
On May 17, 2007, the NYSE notified the Company that the required information regarding the presiding director was not disclosed in the Companys proxy statement. The Company explained that the presiding director rotates by alphabetical order according to each non-management directors last name, and that the information had been inadvertently deleted during the drafting of the 2007 proxy statement. The NYSE confirmed that the filing of this Current Report on Form 8-K satisifes the Companys disclosure obligation.
