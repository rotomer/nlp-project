Revenues were $502.2 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to $417.1 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $507.0 million in the second quarter of 2007.
The third quarter 2007 results included $1.1 million, or 1 per share, of gains on asset sales, compared to $2.3 million, or 2 per share, in the third quarter of 2006 and $14.6 million, or 8 per share, in the second quarter of 2007.  The prior-year results also included approximately $1.2 million, or 1 per share, of after-tax income from the Companys discontinued aviation operations which were sold in 2004.
Rowans drilling operations generated record revenues of $368.8 million during the third quarter of 2007, up by $79.2 million, or 27%, from the third quarter of 2006 and by $15.7 million, or 4%, from the second quarter of 2007.  The Companys income from drilling operations improved to $183.5 million, or 50% of revenues, during the third quarter of 2007, up by 44% from the third quarter of 2006 and by 1% from the second quarter of 2007.
Rowans offshore rig utilization was 99% during the third quarter of 2007, up from 91% in the third quarter of 2006 and 97% in the second quarter of 2007.  The Companys average offshore day rate was $158,200 during the third quarter of 2007, up by $11,400, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2006 and by $1,100, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2007.  Rowans land rig utilization was 96% during the third quarter of 2007, down from 98% in the third quarter of 2006 and 97% in the second quarter of 2007, though the number of rig operating days increased between periods.

Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Rowans drilling operations have again contributed record results, and recent contract negotiations support our confidence that this upward trend will continue into 2008 and beyond.  For example, we have received a letter of intent from a major integrated oil company for two years of work offshore Angola that the should begin late in the first quarter of 2008, and from which we expect revenues of approximately $264 million.  In the Gulf of Mexico, we are nearing finalization of a six-month commitment for the commencing in April 2008 at a day rate of $195,000, or an 11% increase over the rigs current rate.  In the North Sea, we are negotiating a six-month extension of the and expect a day rate in excess of $300,000.

We believe these fixtures reaffirm the Companys strategy of building and operating a fleet of jack-up rigs that can efficiently drill high-pressure, high-temperature and extended- reach wells in challenging environments throughout the world.  Even in the Gulf of Mexico, where volatile natural gas prices have recently weakened overall rig activity and day rates, we have experienced solid demand for our more capable rigs.  Thus, as we have announced separately this morning, we intend to continue the process of upgrading and expanding our jack-up fleet by building six additional high-specification jack-ups over the next four years.
Our manufacturing businesses are key to our strategy.  Rowan receives continuing innovation in jack-up rig designs and related drilling equipment and access to a proven shipyard that offers us the flexibility to modify construction schedules as market conditions may warrant.  Our manufacturing businesses are critical to keeping our rig fleet on the leading edge of capability.
External market acceptance of our manufactured drilling products has continued growing as well.  Our announced backlog includes an additional offshore rig kit ordered during the third quarter for completion in mid 2008, our tenth external rig kit ordered in the last two and a half years.  We recently received an order from an Indian company for two complete land rigs that we expect to deliver this year, bringing the 2007 total to six land rigs.  One of those six is performing very well in Australia and we have in-hand a letter of intent for a second land rig for delivery there in 2008.  Just last week we signed a supply agreement with a Russian company under which we expect to ramp up to ten land rig packages per year by 2010.

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Rowan Companies, Inc. (RDC-NYSE) announced today that it has entered into contracts with Keppel AmFELS, Inc. for the construction of four Super 116E class jack-ups.   The rigs will be built at AmFELS Brownsville, Texas shipyard, with delivery scheduled at approximately four-month intervals beginning in the second quarter of 2010.  Rowans total cost of each rig is expected to average approximately $175 million, with more than one-third of that amount attributable to the cost value of the design, kit components and drilling equipment to be provided by the Companys manufacturing businesses.
Rowan will also build two additional 240-C class jack-ups at its own Vicksburg, Mississippi shipyard for delivery in the third quarters of 2010 and 2011, at a total cost of approximately $400 million.  The 240-C was designed to be a significant upgrade of the original 116-C class, which has been the "workhorse" of the global drilling industry since its introduction in the late 1970s.  The Companys first two 240-C rigs are currently under construction at Vicksburg, with delivery expected in the third quarters of 2008 and 2009.
Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We have continued to experience unprecedented global demand for premium drilling equipment.  Each of these new rigs will employ the latest technology to be able to efficiently drill high-pressure, high-temperature and extended-reach wells in just about every prominent jack-up market throughout the world.   All six of these new rigs will be equipped to reach 35,000 feet.
The construction contracts with Keppel AmFELS afford us the opportunity to accelerate the expansion of our offshore drilling business by partnering with a first class organization and shipyard.  We will provide our innovative rig design and drilling equipment to this project in further testament to the synergies between our drilling and manufacturing divisions, resulting in an average $20 million cost savings per rig and a proportionately higher return on our investment.
