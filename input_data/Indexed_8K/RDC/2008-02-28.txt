Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Rowans fourth quarter operating results concluded another record year for the Company.  By just about any financial measure, our performance in 2007 was the best in the Companys 85-year history.  Our backlog of business, which currently approaches $2.5 billion, together with our aggressive strategic growth plan, suggest that even better times are ahead for Rowan.
