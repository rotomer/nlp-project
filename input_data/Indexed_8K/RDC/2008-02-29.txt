Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Our Compensation Committee (the "Committee") met on January 30, 2008 and discussed bonus payouts to our named executive officers ("NEOs"). Based on projections of the Company's earnings for fiscal year 2007, the Committee tentatively approved certain bonus payouts. On February 26, 2008, our Board of Directors met, reviewed and approved for disclosure our actual 2007 earnings; therefore, the final bonus amounts are now determinable and payable.
Our bonus plan ("Bonus Plan) is divided into two equal pieces: under one, payouts depend solely on Drilling Division EBITDA relative to budget; under the other, payouts depend on the degree to which the individual met specific operational and other individual and group goals. Bonus plan payouts are determined as follows:
In February 2008, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the NEOs and certain other members of management receive a special bonus amount in addition to the amounts discussed above. Such special bonus amounts are intended to reward those members of management for their efforts in 2007 in producing the Company's best financial results in its history. For the NEOs, such special bonuses were as follows:
 
Therefore, total amounts payable to the named executive officers for all 2007 bonus amounts are shown below:
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2008
The Company's Bonus Plan and Profit Sharing Plan for 2008 were also reviewed by the Committee. Any awards under the Bonus Plan will only be made after the Profit Sharing Plan has been fully paid. The 2008 plans are identical to the 2007 plans in structure and potential payout and are based in part on the results of the Company's drilling operations, specifically, the percentage of EBITDA return on revenues in excess of a minimum threshold (with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan) and relative to budget (with respect to the Bonus Plan).
Each participant in the Bonus Plan has an aggregate incentive target that is a percentage of the participant's base salary. The terms of the 2008 plan are substantially the same as for 2007 as described in Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 28, 2006, except that the EBITDA goal used for the Bonus plans was revised for 2008.
A summary of each of the Profit Sharing Plan and Bonus Plan was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 28, 2006 and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
