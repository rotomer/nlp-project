Rowan Companies, Inc. made the following statement in light of news reports published by Reuters concerning comments made earlier today by Daniel F. McNease, Rowan's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, at the Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans:
According to an initial news report published today by Reuters, Mr. McNease stated that Rowan had been approached by a number of companies concerning a potential merger. In a subsequent news report, Reuters clarified that Mr. McNease's statement with respect to merger inquiries related solely to Rowan's wholly-owned manufacturing subsidiary, LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. (LTI). On March 31, 2008, Rowan announced that its Board of Directors had decided to pursue a monetization of LTI, with a view towards completing such a monetization transaction by the end of 2008. Mr. McNease's comments did not relate to any approaches or inquiries concerning Rowan.
