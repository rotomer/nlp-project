Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On April 11, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") met and made the following recommendations regarding compensation for certain of the Company's executive officers. Such recommendations were approved by the Board of Directors in its meeting on April 11, 2008.
Base Salary Adjustments for 2008
The following new base salaries were approved and are effective as of April 1, 2008.
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2008
The Company's two integrated 2008 short-term incentive compensation plans (a broad-based profit sharing plan and a targeted bonus plan) were also reviewed by the Committee. Any awards under the Bonus Plan will only be made after the Profit Sharing Plan has been fully paid.
As in prior years, the 2008 short-term incentive compensation performance goals are based in part on the results of the Company's drilling operations, specifically, the Drilling division EBITDA relative to budget. Each participant in the Bonus Plan has an aggregate incentive target that is a percentage of the participant's base salary. The terms of the 2008 plans are attached as exhibits hereto.
The following officers have the aggregate incentive targets set forth below.

Performance Shares awarded to the individuals listed above can range from zero to 200% of a predetermined target, with the maximum awards as follows: McNease  110,780 shares, Russell  49,556 shares, Keller  36,688 shares, Buvens  28,488 shares, and Wells  28,488 shares.
