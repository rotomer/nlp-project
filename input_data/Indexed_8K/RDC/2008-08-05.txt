HOUSTON, TEXAS  For the three months ended June 30, 2008, Rowan Companies, Inc.

Rowans offshore rig utilization was 96% during the second quarter of 2008, up from 91% in the first quarter of 2008 but down from 97% in the prior year quarter, with much of the downtime in each period associated with rig relocations.

The Companys average land rig day rate was $22,600 during the second quarter of 2008, down by $600 or 3% from the first quarter of 2008, but up by $200 or 1% over the second quarter of 2007.

Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased with the contributions from our drilling and manufacturing businesses, each of which achieved a sequential improvement in revenues and operating income during the second quarter.  Our drilling results benefitted from our continued excellent operating performance, including the timely redeployment of assets, which yielded improvements in fleet utilization and average day rates during the quarter.
 
Onshore, several of our land rigs secured term commitments during the quarter, including two rigs that were each contracted for three years.  We view this as a strong signal of operator confidence in the economics of the U. S. land drilling market, and Rowan is poised to benefit further should this trend continue.  Offshore, we expect to see the rebound in Gulf of Mexico day rates continue.  The global jack-up market remains strong and we are continuing to pursue international opportunities that are demanding premium equipment for deep gas or extended-reach drilling.  Rowan remains a unique player in the offshore rig market, specializing in high specification jack-up rigs ideally suited for the increasingly demanding drilling conditions of deep, high-temperature, high-pressure wells, and we believe we are well-positioned to meet the growing needs of the oil and gas industry.
 
Our newbuild program for nine ultra-premium high-specification jack-up rigs is proceeding as planned.  Our first class jack-up, the , and our fourth jack-up, the , are currently scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2008.  We are aggressively pursuing long-term contracts for these rigs worldwide.  Our second class jack-up, the , is scheduled for delivery during the third quarter of 2009, followed by three additional jack-up rigs in each of 2010 and 2011.
