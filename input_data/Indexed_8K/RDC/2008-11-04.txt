Danny McNease, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, As previously reported, our third quarter financial performance was impacted by Hurricane Ike, which caused the loss of our oldest offshore drilling rig, the , and significantly disrupted our Houston manufacturing operations.
Rowan-Anchorage
The recent capital markets and commodity price weakness have adversely affected opportunities for monetizing our investment in LTI for what we believe to be adequate value for Rowan stockholders.  Therefore, at this time, we are not pursuing any further negotiations with potential partners.  However, we will continue to review all strategic options, including a spin-off of LTI to our stockholders.  We do not anticipate that a transaction, if any, will be completed until capital market conditions improve significantly.
Continuing weakness in capital markets and commodity prices will, eventually, affect customer demand for our products and services, though we have experienced little impact thus far.  To the contrary, we have over the past two months added significantly to our backlog of business, including almost $300 million of term drilling contracts for our two newbuild jack-ups to be delivered later this month.  We see continuing firm demand in both domestic and foreign markets for the right type of equipment having a proven drilling organization behind it.
Thus, we remain optimistic for the prospects of our seven other jack-ups currently under construction or on order, though we are reviewing the scheduled timing of our third and fourth 240-C class jack-up rigs, currently planned for delivery in 2010 and 2011, for opportunities to preserve near-term liquidity.  Of course, its our continuing ownership of LTI that gives us the flexibility to alter these construction schedules, if that becomes necessary."
