FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                                                                                   February 26, 2009
   
   
   
 
HOUSTON, TEXAS  For the three months ended December 31, 2008, Rowan Companies, Inc. (RDC  NYSE) generated net income of $94.3 million or $0.83 per share, compared to $138.5 million or $1.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $114.1 million or $1.00 per share in the third quarter of 2008.  Revenues were $613.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $623.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $527.1 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Excluding the nonrecurring gains and expenses described below, earnings for the fourth quarter were $144.8 million or $1.28 per share.
The fourth quarter 2008 results included $111.2 million, or $0.68 per share of impairment charges and other expenses, partially offset by $39.5 million, or $0.23 per share, of gains on asset disposals.  The charges and other expenses included a $62 million reserve against excess manufacturing inventories, $14 million to write off goodwill, a $12 million charge against a cancelled rig construction project, $13 million related to the aborted sale of our manufacturing operations, and $10 million of severance costs.  The gains resulted primarily from Hurricane Ike insurance recoveries.  The comparable periods included no impairment charges or other nonrecurring expenses, but included gains on asset disposals of $0.7 million, or less than $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $21.4 million, or $0.12 per share, in the third quarter of 2008.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company generated net income of $427.6 million or $3.77 per share on revenues of $2.2 billion, compared to net income of $483.8 million or $4.31 per share on revenues of $2.1 billion in 2007.  Excluding the nonrecurring gains and expenses described above, earnings for the full year 2008 were $460.7 million or $4.06 per share.
Rowans drilling operations generated revenues of $386.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, up by 8% over the third quarter of 2008 and by 4% over the prior-year quarter, due primarily to higher average offshore utilization and day rates.  The Companys income from drilling operations was $201.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, up by 21% over the third quarter of 2008 and by 18% over the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
 
 
Rowans manufacturing operations generated external revenues of $226.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, up by 33% over the third quarter of 2008, but down by 10% from the prior-year quarter.  As a result of certain charges and other expenses as described above, the Company incurred a loss from manufacturing operations of $45.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to operating income of $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2008 and $38.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Excluding the charges and other expenses, income from manufacturing operations was $41.6 million, or 18% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 3% in the third quarter of 2008 and 15% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are very pleased with the strong performance of both our drilling and manufacturing operations in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in total year profitability that was the second highest in the Companys history. However, ongoing reductions by our customers in their spending plans for 2009 will put downward pressure on day rates until prices for oil and natural gas improve and credit markets begin to function more normally.   
Fortunately, we have a very strong financial position and have 67% of our total offshore rig days currently committed in 2009.  And, despite the current weakness in worldwide rig markets, the combination of our high spec rig fleet, our highly skilled workforce, and our reputation for operational excellence gives us confidence that we can achieve above market day rates and utilization for our equipment in all market conditions.
