Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 21, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Rowan Companies, Inc. (the Company) met and made the following recommendations regarding compensation for the Companys named executive officers (NEOs). Such recommendations were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors in its meeting on February 25, 2009, after the Boards review of the Companys earnings for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Award for Fiscal 2008
For 2008, the NEOs were eligible for awards under the Companys two integrated 2008 short-term incentive compensation plans: a broad-based profit sharing plan (Profit Sharing Plan) and a targeted bonus plan (Bonus Plan). Awards under the Bonus Plan may only be made after the Profit Sharing Plan has been fully paid.
For 2008, the Bonus Plan was divided into two equal pieces: under one, payouts depended solely on Drilling Division EBITDA relative to budget; and under the other, payouts depended on the degree to which the individual met specific operational and other individual and group goals. Bonus plan payouts were determined as follows:
In 2008, our Drilling Division EBITDA, as adjusted by the Compensation Committee for certain non-recurring and other items, was within 2% of the budgeted amount, and therefore the nondiscretionary payouts were 94% based on the scale above.
Payouts under these two categories are independent of each other and are reduced by any payout under the Profit Sharing Plan.
 
With respect to the discretionary portion of the Bonus Plan awards for the four highest paid NEOs, other than the CEO, the Committee recommended that they receive 200% of their targeted discretionary portion. Total amounts payable to the named executive officers for all 2008 bonus amounts are shown below:
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2009
Approximately 85 employees are eligible to participate in the 2009 Bonus Plan. The plan contains five financial and operational metrics, each based on the Drilling Divisions performance. To the extent the various metrics are achieved, the bonus pool will be funded from 0 to 200% of the eligible employees aggregate target bonus amount.
Once 2009 achievement of the various metrics is known, the Compensation Committee will determine the funding of the bonus pool. The Committee is free to use its discretion to increase or decrease the bonus pool as it sees fit. The CEO will then allocate the funded bonus pool among the Companys operating and corporate groups based on each groups performance. Individual managers will then further allocate bonus payouts to employees based on individual performance of employees. In addition, each of our CEO, Executive Vice President-Legal and our Vice President-Finance and CFO will have 10% of his target bonus determined by the performance of our manufacturing subsidiary as evidenced by achievement under the subsidiarys bonus plan.
 
2009 Adjustments to Base Salary, Bonus Plan and Long-Term Incentive Targets for the NEOs
On February 27, 2009, the Compensation Committee met to review the base salary and short-term and long-term incentive targets of the NEOs. The Committee made no adjustments to compensation levels for 2009 for any of the NEOs.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
