News Release
 
Rowan Companies, Inc.
2800 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 5450
   Houston, Texas 77056 (713) 621-7800
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                                                                                   May 7, 2009
   
   
   
 
HOUSTON, TEXAS  For the three months ended March 31, 2009, Rowan Companies, Inc. (RDC  NYSE) generated net income of $131.7 million or $1.16 per share, compared to $98.6 million or $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2008 and $94.3 million or $0.83 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Revenues were $494.8 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $485.5 million in the first quarter of 2008 and $613.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
The first quarter 2009 results included $4.7 million of gains on asset disposals or $0.02 per share, compared to $5.4 million or $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2008 and $39.5 million, or $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The fourth quarter 2008 results also included $111.2 million, or $0.68 per share of impairment charges and other expenses; there were no such charges in the first quarter of 2009.
 
Rowans drilling operations generated revenues of $380.4 million in the first quarter of 2009, up by 12% over the prior-year quarter due primarily to rigs added in the fourth quarter, but down by 2% from the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to lower utilization.  The Companys income from drilling operations was $187.1 million in the first quarter of 2009, up by 30% over the first quarter of 2008 but down by 7% from the fourth quarter of 2008.  The Companys income from manufacturing operations was $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2009.
 
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are very pleased with the strong performance of both our drilling and manufacturing operations in the first quarter of 2009, particularly in the area of cost reduction.  This is an area of considerable focus for Rowan, especially as weakening demand for drilling services and equipment continues to put downward pressure on our revenues.
 
While all of our jack-ups are under contract today, we are likely to have idle time on jack-ups in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Middle East in the near future.  Nonetheless, we continue to believe that the quality of our rigs and our operational reputation will enable us to maintain above average utilization of our available jack-ups.
