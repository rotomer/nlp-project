Item 5.02    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On May 4, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) met and made recommendations regarding compensation for certain of the Companys executive officers. Such recommendations were approved by the Board of Directors in its meeting on May 5, 2009.
 
Given current industry conditions, management of the Company suggested, and the Committee and the Board agreed, that no adjustments to base salary, short-term incentive targets or long-term incentive targets would be made at this time for any of the Companys officers.  In addition, the Company discontinued its broad-based profit sharing plan for the foreseeable future.
 
On May 5, 2009, the named executive officers were granted long-term incentive awards at a value equal to the individuals long-term incentive target.  Fifty percent of such target value was awarded in the form of stock appreciation rights (SARs) and 50 percent was awarded in the form of restricted stock, each vesting ratably over a three-year term.  Such awards were made under the Rowan Companies, Inc. 2009 Incentive Plan (the Plan), which was approved by the Companys stockholders on May 5, 2009, at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Annual Meeting).
 
 The table below shows the long-term incentive target value and awards made for each of the named executive officers:
 
 
 
 
The Plan was included as Appendix A to the Companys proxy statement filed on March 23, 2009 and is incorporated herein by reference.
