Matt Ralls, Rowans President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Earlier this year we halted construction on this rig due to concerns over the turmoil in the credit markets and the downturn in jack-up drilling markets.  Based on improvements in the credit markets and our confidence in our liquidity outlook through 2010, we have elected to resume construction. We believe that this very capable, high specification rig will generate an attractive return on capital based on its expected go forward cost of $150 million and will be met with widespread customer acceptance when it is delivered in 2011.
 
The Company began construction of the initial class rig, the , in 2007.  The was designed to be a significant upgrade of the original class, which was the "workhorse" of the global drilling industry since its introduction in the late 1970s.  The , like its sister rigs the and the will have 2.5 million pounds of hookload, an 80 feet cantilever reach and 491 feet of leg length.
