Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On July 15, 2009, Rowan Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into an underwriting agreement with Barclays Capital Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, relating to the issuance and sale in an underwritten public offering by the Company of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Notes"). The offer and sale of the Notes was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-160579), which became effective upon filing with the Commission on July 15, 2009. The material terms of the offering are described in the prospectus supplement dated July 15, 2009, which was filed by the Company with the Commission on July 16, 2009.
     The underwriting agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, and customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and the underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The foregoing description of the underwriting agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the underwriting agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
     The underwriters and certain of their affiliates have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future, certain investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. Affiliates of Barclays Capital Inc. own approximately 7% of the Company's common stock.
     The Notes constitute a new series of debt securities under an indenture dated as of July 21, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of July 21, 2009 (the "First Supplemental Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, setting forth the specific terms applicable to the Notes.
     The information included in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The description of the Base Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture, a copy of each filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     On July 21, 2009, the Company successfully completed the issuance and sale of the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing February 1, 2010. The Notes will mature on August 1, 2019. The Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, is referred to herein as the "Indenture."
     The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $492 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, for general corporate purposes.
     The Company may, at its option, redeem all or part of the Notes at any time at a make-whole price. The Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank effectively junior to all existing and future secured debt, including indebtedness under the Company's secured notes issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration, or MARAD, pursuant to the provisions of Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, with respect to the financing of several of the Company's offshore drilling rigs, to the extent of the value of the Company's assets constituting collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future unsecured debt that is not by its terms subordinated to the Notes, including any indebtedness under the Company's senior revolving credit facility (other than letter of credit reimbursement obligations that are secured by cash deposits), and senior to any subordinated debt that the Company may incur. The Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the subsidiaries of the Company.
     The following are events of default with respect to the Notes:
     (1) default in the payment of any interest upon the Notes when due and payable that continues for 30 days;
     (2) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes when due at its maturity, declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise;
     (3) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant set forth in Article Ten of the Indenture (other than a covenant for which default or breach is specifically addressed within these events of default) that continues for 60 days after there has been given written notice from the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes outstanding specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" under the Indenture;
 
     (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant of the Indenture (other than a covenant in Article Ten of the Indenture and any other covenant for which default or breach is specifically addressed within these events of default) that continues for 120 days after there has been given written notice from the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes outstanding specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" under the Indenture;
     (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company;
     (6) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment when due; or
     (7) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any current or future debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in Article I, Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended), or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, if such default (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such debt prior to the expiration of the grace period for such debt on the date of such default, or payment default, or (b) results in the acceleration of such debt prior to its express maturity and in each case described in (a) or (b), the principal amount of such debt, together with the principal amount of any other such debt under which that has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates at least $35.0 million.
     If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes outstanding may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal amount will become due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of the Notes outstanding will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders of the Notes. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences.

          (d) During the period in which the Prospectus relating to the Notes (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Rules and Regulations) is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, the Company will comply with all requirements imposed upon it by the Securities Act and by the Rules and Regulations, as from time to time in force, so far as is necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Notes as contemplated by the provisions of this Agreement and by the Prospectus. If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or file any document to comply with the Securities Act, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will, subject to Section 4(a) hereof, amend the Registration Statement, amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, or file any document (in each case, at the expense of the Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and will furnish without charge to each Underwriter as many written and electronic copies of any such amendment or supplement as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request.

If the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated by reason of acts of the Company or changes in circumstances of the Company pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on their part to be performed or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled or if the Underwriters decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement (other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters pursuant to Section 9 hereof), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with any investigation or preparation made by them in respect of the marketing of the Notes or in contemplation of the performance by them of their obligations hereunder.
          (g) Until completion of the distribution of the Notes, the Company will timely file all reports, documents and amendments to previously filed documents required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 12, 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

          (j) The Company will pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time period required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Rules and Regulations without
 
regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Rules and Regulations.
          (k) If required by Rule 430B(h) of the Rules and Regulations, the Company will prepare a prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives and file such prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations not later than may be required by such Rule; and the Company will make no further amendment or supplement to such prospectus that will be disapproved by the Representatives promptly after reasonable notice thereof.
          (l) The Company will cooperate with the Underwriters and with counsel to the Underwriters in connection with the qualification of the Notes for offering and sale by the Underwriters and by dealers under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate and will file such consents to service of process or other documents necessary or appropriate in order to effect such qualification and to permit the continuance of sales and dealings in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Notes; that in no event will the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to service of process in suits, other than for actions or proceedings arising out of the offering or sale of the Notes, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
provided, however,
          (m) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or that might cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Notes to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.
          (n) The Company will comply with all agreements set forth in the representation letters of the Company to DTC relating to the acceptance of the Notes for "book- entry" transfer through the facilities of DTC.
          5. .
Free Writing Prospectuses
          (a) The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that (i) the Company has not made, and will not, make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus without the prior consent of the Representatives (which consent being deemed to have been given with respect to (A) the Final Term Sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof and (B) any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus identified on hereto); (ii) each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conformed or will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations on the date of first use, and the Company has complied with any filing requirements applicable to such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations; (iii) each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not, as of its issue date and through the time the Notes are delivered pursuant to Section 3 hereof, include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus; and (iv) each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the information contained in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus, did not, as of the Applicable Time, does not, as of the date hereof, and will not, as of the Closing Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
Schedule II
 
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          (b) Each Underwriter represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company and each other Underwriter that it has not made, and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations) required to be filed with the Commission, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Notes containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Notes.
          (c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.

          (g) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, a "comfort" letter (the "") addressed to the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, dated the date hereof, and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives (i) confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm within the meaning of the Securities Act and are in compliance with the applicable requirements relating to the qualification of accountants under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X of the Commission, (ii) stating, as of the date hereof (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus, as of a date not more than three days prior to the date hereof), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters ordinarily covered by accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters in connection with registered public offerings.

(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including any road show, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any such issuer information,
Indemnification and Contribution
 
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter promptly after receipt of invoices from such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; that the Company will not be liable under this Section 8(a) in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, expressly for use therein (which information is specified in Section 13 hereof).
provided, however,
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company promptly after receipt of invoices from the Company, as the case may be, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; that such indemnification or reimbursement will be available in each such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of such Underwriter, expressly for use therein (which information is specified in Section 13 hereof).
provided, however,
          (c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against one or more indemnifying parties under such subsection, notify each indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; that the failure to so notify each such indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action will be brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies each indemnifying party thereof, each such indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly
provided, however,
 
with each other similarly notified indemnifying party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from each indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, each such indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, except that the Underwriters will have the right to employ counsel to represent the Underwriters who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under Section 8(a) if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Underwriters will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are different from or additional to those available to the Company and in the judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes (A) an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent, but if settled with the consent of each indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, each such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 8(a) or 8(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative
 
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 8(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 8(c) above).
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8, to the respective officers and directors of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
          9. . If any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters will be obligated to purchase (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each non- defaulting Underwriter in hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Notes less the principal amount of the Notes the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in hereto) the principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes if the total principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total principal

amount of the Notes, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in hereto. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Notes. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in Section 8 of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 9.
Schedule I
          If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representatives may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order that the Company may effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and the Company agree to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of the Representatives, may thereby be made necessary.
          Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default.
          10. . Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company, as the case may be, will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any of the events described in Sections 6(j) and 6(k) of this Agreement, shall have occurred, or (iii) any other condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled.

     (o) whether and under what circumstances the Company will pay additional amounts on the Securities of the series held by a Person who is not a U.S. Person in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge withheld or deducted and, if so, whether the Company will have the option to redeem the Securities of the series rather than pay such additional amounts;
     (p) if the Securities of the series are to be issuable in definitive form (whether upon original issue or upon exchange of a temporary Security of such series) only upon receipt of certain certificates or other documents or satisfaction of other conditions, the form and terms of such certificates, documents or conditions;

     All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened, without the consent of the Holders, for increases in the aggregate principal amount of such series of Securities and issuances of additional Securities of such series or for the establishment of additional terms with respect to the Securities of such series.

     With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, such Board Resolution or Officer's Certificate may provide general terms for Securities of such series and provide either that the specific terms of particular Securities of such series shall be specified in a Company Order or that such terms shall be determined by the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors or one or more agents thereof designated in an Officer's Certificate, in accordance with a Company Order.

Section 3.3. .
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating
     The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Chief Financial Officer or any of its Vice Presidents and need not be attested. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Any Securities Guarantee endorsed on the Securities shall be executed on behalf of the applicable Guarantor by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Chief Financial Officer or any of its Vice Presidents and need not be attested. The signature of any of these officers on any endorsement of the Securities Guarantee may be manual or facsimile.
     Securities and any endorsement of a Securities Guarantee bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company or a Guarantor, as the case may be, shall bind the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; , , that in the case of Securities offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities from time to time in accordance with such other procedures (including, without limitation, the receipt by the Trustee of oral or electronic instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agents, thereafter promptly confirmed in writing) acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified by or pursuant to a Company Order delivered to the Trustee prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series. If the forms or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Section 2.1 and Section 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such documents as it may reasonably request. The Trustee shall also be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:
provided
however
 
     (a) if the form or forms of such Securities has been established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that each such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
     (b) if the terms of such Securities have been, or in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering will be, established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have been, or in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering will be, established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture, subject, in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel; and
     (c) that such Securities when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions and assumptions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the following limitations: (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance or transfer and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, or to general equity principles, (ii) the availability of equitable remedies being subject to the discretion of the court to which application therefor is made; and (iii) such other usual and customary matters as shall be specified in such Opinion of Counsel.
If such form or forms or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officer's Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
     With respect to Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, on the form or forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the other documents delivered pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 3.1 and this Section, as applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Securities of such series.
     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Security, nor any Securities Guarantee endorsed thereon, shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.9, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Section 3.4. .
Temporary Securities
     Pending the preparation of Definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the Definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
     If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause Definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for Definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of Definitive Securities of the same series and tenor of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Securities of such series.
Section 3.5. .
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment required by Section 10.2 a register (the register maintained in such office being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed as the initial "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided, and its corporate trust office, which, at the date hereof, is located at 5555 San Felipe, Suite 1150, Houston, Texas 77056, is the initial office or agency where the Securities Register will be maintained. The Company may at any time replace such Security Registrar, change such office or agency or act as its own Security Registrar. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any change of the Security Registrar or of the location of such office or agency.
     Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 10.2 for such purpose, the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, of the same series and tenor, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount.
     At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series (except a Global Security) may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series and tenor, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors evidencing the same debt, and entitled to
 
the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, Section 9.6 or Section 11.7 not involving any transfer.
     The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture and except as otherwise specified with respect to any particular series of Securities as contemplated by Section 3.1, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred, except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary. Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security shall be a Global Security except as provided in the two paragraphs immediately following.
     If at any time the Depositary for any Securities of a series represented by one or more Global Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Securities shall no longer be eligible to continue as Depositary under Section 3.1 or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Securities. If a successor Depositary for such Securities is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election pursuant to Section 3.1 that such Securities be represented by one or more Global Securities shall no longer be effective and the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors will execute and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities registered in the names of such Persons as the Depositary shall direct.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security or Securities. In such event, the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors will execute and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in
 
any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities registered in the names of such Persons as the Depositary shall direct.
     If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to Securities represented by a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of the same series and tenor in definitive registered form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company, the Trustee and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Securities in definitive registered form, shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge:
     (i) to the Person specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, of the same series and tenor, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
     (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.
Every Person who takes or holds any beneficial interest in a Global Security agrees that:
     (A) the Company, the Guarantors (if applicable) and the Trustee may deal with the Depositary as sole owner of the Global Security and as the authorized representative of such Person;
     (B) such Person's rights in the Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreement between such Person and the Depositary and/or direct and indirect participants of the Depositary;
     (C) the Depositary and its participants make book-entry transfers of beneficial ownership among, and receive and transmit distributions of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Global Securities to, such Persons in accordance with their own procedures; and
     (D) none of the Company, the Guarantors (if applicable), the Trustee, nor any agent of any of them will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 3.6. .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
     If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, together with, in proper cases, such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company, the Guarantors (if applicable) or the Trustee to save each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
     If there shall be delivered to the Company, the Guarantors (if applicable) and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security, with an endorsement of the Securities Guarantee, if applicable, executed by the Guarantors, of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors, regardless of whether the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.7. .
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
     Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
     Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
     (a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon, the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not
 
less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
     (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 3.8. .
Persons Deemed Owners
     Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to any series of Securities, prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Guarantors and any agent thereof may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 3.5 and Section 3.7) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, regardless of whether such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee nor, if applicable, the Guarantors nor any agent of any of them shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Security held on its behalf by a Depositary shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security, and such Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and, if applicable, the Guarantors and any agent of thereof as the owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in clause (e) or (f) of Section 5.1 occurs, the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding shall be due and payable immediately without further action or notice.

     (b) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.

Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.

If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining
 
authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and, if applicable, the Guarantors and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     Except with respect to an Authenticating Agent appointed at the request of the Company or, if applicable, the Guarantors, the Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section 6.14, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Company or, if applicable, the Guarantors for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 6.7.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section 6.14, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. If the Securities of any series to be redeemed consist of Securities having different dates on which the principal is payable or different rates of interest, or different methods by which interest may be determined or have any other different tenor or terms, then the Company may, by written notice to the Trustee, direct that the Securities of such series to be redeemed shall be selected from among the groups of such Securities having specified tenor or terms and the Trustee shall thereafter select the particular Securities to be redeemed in the manner set forth in the preceding paragraph from among the group of such Securities so specified.

Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance

Section 13.2. .
Legal Defeasance and Discharge

For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company and the Guarantors will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Securities (including the Securities Guarantees), which will thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 13.5 hereof and the other sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such Securities, the Securities Guarantees and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
     (a) the rights of Holders of Outstanding Securities to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Securities when such payments are due from the trust referred to in Section 13.4 hereof;
     (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Section 3.4, Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 hereof;
     (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and

Section 13.3. .
Covenant Defeasance

For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Securities and Securities Guarantees, the Company and the Guarantors may fail to comply with and will have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such failure to comply will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 5.1 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and Securities Guarantees will be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 13.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 13.3 hereof, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 13.4 hereof, any Event of Default that constitutes an Additional Defeasible Provision will no longer constitute an Event of Default.

Securities Guarantee
     (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article Fourteen, each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each Holder of a Security of each series to which this Article Fourteen has been made applicable as provided in Section 3.1(t) (the Securities of such series being referred to herein as the "Guaranteed Securities") (which Security has been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee), and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Guaranteed Securities, or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:
 
     (i) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Guaranteed Securities will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, or by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Guaranteed Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders of Guaranteed Securities, or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder, will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
     (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Guaranteed Securities or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
     (b) To the extent permissible under applicable law, the obligations of the Guarantors under this Securities Guarantee are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Guaranteed Securities with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that this Securities Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Guaranteed Securities and this Indenture.
     (c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Securities Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full force and effect.
     (d) Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders of Guaranteed Securities and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five hereof for the purposes of this Securities Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Five hereof, such obligations (regardless of whether due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Securities Guarantee. The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Securities Guarantee.

Limitation on Guarantor Liability
     Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Guaranteed Securities, each Holder thereof, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Securities Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar Federal or State law to the extent applicable to any Securities Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Holders and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article Fourteen, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Securities Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Section 14.3. .
Execution and Delivery of Securities Guarantee Notation
     To evidence its Securities Guarantee set forth in Section 14.1 hereof, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Securities Guarantee substantially in the form set forth in Section 2.3 or established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in an indenture supplemental hereto, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1, will be endorsed by an officer of such Guarantor on each Guaranteed Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture will be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by one of its officers.
     Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Securities Guarantee set forth in Section 14.1 hereof will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Guaranteed Security a notation of such Securities Guarantee.
     If an officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Securities Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Guaranteed Security on which a Securities Guarantee is endorsed, the Securities Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.
     The delivery of any Guaranteed Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will constitute due delivery of the Securities Guarantee of such Guaranteed Security set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
 
     This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
