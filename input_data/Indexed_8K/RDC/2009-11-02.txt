Indemnification Agreements
Indemnitee
 
Each Indemnification Agreement provides that the Company will indemnify the applicable Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in the event that such Indemnitee, by reason of such Indemnitees relationship with the Company, is or is threatened to be made a party to or participant in any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, other than an action or proceeding by or in the right of the Company, against all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such action or proceeding, provided that such Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, provided that he or she also had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.  Each Indemnification Agreement further provides that the Company will indemnify such Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in the event that such Indemnitee, by reason of such Indemnitees relationship with the Company, is or is threatened to be made a party to or participant in any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor, against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such action or proceeding, provided that such Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnification against expenses incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such an action or proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company will be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Indemnitee is adjudged to be liable to the Company or if applicable law prohibits such indemnification being made; , , that, in such event, indemnification against such expenses will nevertheless be made by the Company if and to the extent that the court in which such action or proceeding has been brought or is pending so determines.  Each Indemnification Agreement also provides for the advance of all reasonable expenses incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any action or proceeding covered by the Indemnification Agreement.  The Indemnitee will be required to repay any amounts so advanced if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company against such expenses.

On October 29, 2009, the Board of Directors approved changes to certain of the Company's benefit plans. Based upon a review of the Company's retirement programs by the Company's retirement consultant, Mercer, and a competitive analysis by the Board's compensation consultant, Cogent Compensation Partners, a decision was made to amend the Companys Pension Benefit Restoration Plan (Restoration Plan) to provide benefits for service after June 30, 2009.
Effective June 30, 2009, final average pay formula pension benefits were frozen for all eligible employees including officers of the Company. Effective July 1, 2009, all eligible employees began accruing benefits under a cash balance formula which recognizes base pay and annual bonus up to Internal Revenue Service limitations ($245,000 in 2009). Eligible employees are also eligible to receive a Company matching contribution of up to 6% of pay subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations.
Effective July 1, 2009, the Restoration Plan will be amended to recognize pay in excess of Internal Revenue Service limitations for eligible members of the Executive Group of the Company (currently 19 individuals) for benefits accruing after June 30, 2009. Restoration Plan benefits are determined under the same formulas applicable to all eligible employees.
Under the amended Restoration Plan, hypothetical accounts will be established for each member. These accounts will be credited with cash balance formula benefits and matching contributions (without having to make elective employee deferral contributions) for pay in excess of Internal Revenue Service limitations. Interest will be credited to each hypothetical account based on the 10-year Treasury rate, the same rate used for the Companys tax-qualified cash balance plan. Restoration Plan benefits are an unsecured obligation of the Company.  The cost of the new program will not have a material impact on the Companys financials.

Section 2.  
Indemnification of Employees and Agents
 
.  If a written claim received by the Corporation from or on behalf of an indemnified party under this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within ninety days after such receipt (thirty days in the case of a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation), the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
