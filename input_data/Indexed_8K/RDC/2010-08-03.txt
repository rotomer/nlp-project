HOUSTON, TEXAS  For the three months ended June 30, 2010, Rowan Companies, Inc. (Rowan or the Company) (NYSE: RDC) generated net income of $90.9 million or $0.79 per share, compared to $96.6 million or $0.85 per share in the second quarter of 2009.  Revenues were $490.1 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $482.2 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Rowans drilling operations generated revenues of $328.3 million in the second quarter of 2010, up by 2% from the prior-year quarter as the impact of offshore fleet additions and higher land rig utilization more than offset lower average day rates.  The Companys gross drilling margin was 58% of revenues in the second quarter of 2010, up from 57% in the prior-year quarter as a result of continued focus on cost effectiveness.  Income from drilling operations was $124.0 million in the second quarter of 2010, down by 3% from the prior-year quarter due to higher depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Rowans manufacturing operations generated external revenues of $161.8 million in the second quarter of 2010, unchanged from the prior-year quarter.  The Companys gross manufacturing margin was 15% of revenues in the second quarter of 2010, up from 9% in the prior-year quarter.  Income from manufacturing operations was $6.4 million in the second quarter of 2010, up by 137% from the prior-year quarter.
 
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Our contract drilling operations turned in very good results in the second quarter.  As a result, our earnings came in well above consensus expectations, with roughly half the beat from higher drilling revenues and half from lower drilling expenses.  Our manufacturing group had strong revenue for the quarter, especially from the mining products and steel groups, but also had higher than expected expenses, primarily related to warranty costs, bad debts and other charges resulting from an intensive review by the new management team at LeTourneau.  As a result, overall manufacturing margins basically met expectations.
We continue to see good demand for high-spec jack ups, and expect to receive a commitment for the EXL-III in the near future.  Our track record of finding term contracts for each of our recent new build jack-ups prior to delivery gives us confidence that we will find attractive opportunities for the three N-class rigs we will be acquiring in the Skeie Drilling transaction.  We expect to begin the tender process for the 50% of the SKDP stock not already committed to us later this month and hope to conclude it by the end of September.

HOUSTON, TEXAS  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, Rowan Companies, Inc. (Rowan or the Company) (NYSE: RDC) generated net income of $64.6 million or $0.56 per share, compared to $131.7 million or $1.16 per share in the first quarter of 2009.  Earnings for the current quarter were $93.3 million, or $0.81 per share excluding an inventory charge at the Companys manufacturing subsidiary discussed below.  Revenues were $432.4 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $494.8 million in the first quarter of 2009.
 
The first quarter 2010 results included a $42.0 million pre-tax charge, or $0.25 per share after tax, for estimated losses associated with non-conforming and slow-moving inventory items in the Companys Drilling Products and Systems manufacturing segment. The first quarter 2009 results included no such charges, but included gains on asset disposals of $4.7 million, or $0.02 per share.
 
Rowans drilling operations generated revenues of $331 million in the first quarter of 2010, down by 13% from the prior-year quarter but up by 30% from the fourth quarter of 2009, due primarily to changes in rig utilization.  The Companys gross drilling margin was 59% of revenues in the first quarter of 2010, down from 62% in the prior-year quarter but up from 52% in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Income from drilling operations was $137.0 million in the first quarter of 2010, down by 27% from the prior-year quarter but up by 80% from the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Rowans manufacturing operations generated external revenues of $101.4 million in the first quarter of 2010, down by 11% from the prior-year quarter.  The Companys gross manufacturing margin was 17% of revenues in the first quarter of 2010, down from 21% in the prior-year quarter.  Excluding the charge discussed above, Income from manufacturing operations was $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, down by 72% from the prior-year quarter.
 
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Rowans drilling operations experienced a strong first quarter, with good cost control and excellent uptime for our jack-up rigs under contract.  With the delivery next week of the first of our four EXL rigs under construction, half of our jack-up fleet will be high-spec rigs, which we define as rigs with hook-loads of two million pounds or more.  We are seeing strong interest by operators in several markets for rigs with this capability, and all of our high-spec rigs are currently contracted.
 
Our new management team at LeTourneau has been going through a rigorous review of inventories at its Houston facility, and we have determined that a charge is warranted.  Notwithstanding this non-cash charge, we are optimistic about the future of LeTourneau as it continues to improve manufacturing processes and efficiencies.

(Rowan or the Company) (NYSE: RDC) generated net income of $60.8 million or $0.53 per share, compared to $94.3 million or $0.83 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Revenues were $399.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $613.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Results for the fourth quarter of 2009 included $1.4 million or $0.01 per share of gains on asset disposals, compared to $39.4 million or $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.  As previously reported, the fourth quarter 2008 results included $111.2 million, or $0.68 per share of material charges and other expenses.  The current year included no material charges.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company generated net income of $367.5 million or $3.24 per share on revenues of $1.8 billion, compared to net income of $427.6 million or $3.77 per share on revenues of $2.2 billion in 2008.  The 2009 results included $5.7 million or $0.03 per share of gains in asset disposals in 2009, compared to $67.8 million or $0.39 per share in 2008.
 
The 2009 results also included $25.4 million or $0.22 per share of tax benefits related to a recent third-party tax court ruling, which provided that certain foreign-source income is not taxable in the United States.  Excluding these tax benefits and the material charges and disposal gains described above, earnings were $338.3 million or $2.98 per share in 2009 and $460.7 million or $4.06 per share in 2008.
 
Rowans drilling operations generated revenues of $255.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down by 34% from the prior-year quarter due primarily to lower rig utilization.  The Companys gross drilling margin was 52% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009, down from 62% in the prior-year quarter.  Income from drilling operations was $76.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down by 66% from the prior-year quarter (excluding material charges).
 
Rowans manufacturing operations generated external revenues of $144.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down by 36% from the prior-year quarter.  The Companys gross manufacturing margin was 17% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009, down from 25% in the prior-year quarter.  Income from manufacturing operations was $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down by 78% from the prior-year quarter (excluding material charges).
 
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, During the last few months, we have seen increased activity and tendering in virtually every jack-up market segment worldwide, with the Middle East, North Sea and Gulf of Mexico regions being the most significant for our fleet.  We continue to see good demand for higher-specification jack-ups, and have added backlog at attractive day rates for our Super Gorillas.  We are especially pleased to have played a role in McMoRans ultra-deep gas discovery, Davy Jones, in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico, and we now have three high-spec jack-ups and the committed to or under contract with McMoRan.  We are optimistic that this significant discovery will lead to future increases in ultra-deep gas drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico requiring jack-up rigs with the advanced operating capabilities that characterize the Rowan fleet.

Additionally, we have seen a very strong recovery in the U. S. land rig market and have reactivated or obtained commitments for several land rigs in the fourth quarter of 2009 and so far in 2010.  This pickup in activity for Rowans high quality land rig fleet is all the more impressive considering that there remain nearly one thousand idle land rigs in North America.  It demonstrates the increasing willingness by operators to pay higher rates for more efficient equipment, enabling them to reduce overall drilling costs.  We believe there is a similar high-grading trend occurring in the global jack-up market that will allow us to obtain attractive day rates for our premium and high-spec jack-ups despite the large number of idle rigs at the low end of the jack-up market.
