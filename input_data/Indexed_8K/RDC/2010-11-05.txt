Rowan Companies, Inc.  (the Company) is filing this Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment) to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 1, 2010 (the Report) solely to include with the Report a copy of the SKDP debt agreements referenced in Item 1.01 of the Report.
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 1, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with certain shareholders of Skeie Drilling & Production ASA (SKDP) and obtained irrevocable commitments from two other shareholders of SKDP (collectively, the Sellers) for the purchase of their shares, which constituted 48.8% of the outstanding ordinary shares of SKDP.  Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement and irrevocable commitments, the Company agreed to issue 0.00574167 shares of Rowan common stock for each ordinary share of SKDP owned by the Sellers.  In July 2010, the Company purchased an additional 1.5% of SKDP shares for cash in the open market.
 
In August 2010, the Company issued common stock to certain shareholders of SKDP in private placements in exchange for their SKDP shares and, on August 24, 2010, commenced a tender offer for all remaining ordinary shares of SKDP on the same terms (the Exchange Offer).  Through the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the private placements and the Exchange Offer, the Company acquired approximately 96% of the outstanding SKDP shares. On September 30, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining SKDP shares in cash through a compulsory acquisition pursuant to the Norwegian Public Companies Act.  The SKDP shares have since been delisted from the Norwegian OTC.  The total consideration paid for all of the SKDP shares was approximately $13 million in cash and 11,724,818 shares of Rowan common stock.
 
SKDP had existing debt totaling approximately $530 million (at par value), of which the Company has repurchased $141 million in the open market, including $60 million subsequent to September 30, 2010.   On September 16, 2010, the SKDP Board of Directors notified the bond trustee that, as part of a post-acquisition restructuring, SKDP intends to sell the to a Rowan subsidiary organized in Gibraltar.  Under the terms of the SKDP debt agreements, this transaction triggered a mandatory prepayment event of all indebtedness secured by the rig; the mandatory prepayment event occurred on November 1, 2010.
