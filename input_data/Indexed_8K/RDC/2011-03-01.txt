Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On February 24, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Rowan Companies, Inc. (the Company) met and made the following recommendations regarding compensation for the Companys named executive officers (NEOs).  Such recommendations were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors in its meeting on February 25, 2011.
2010 Annual Incentive Plan Awards
In 2010, the NEOs participated in a targeted annual incentive bonus plan (AIP). Each participant in the AIP has an incentive target that is a percentage of base salary. Awards are generally based on performance of our Drilling Division, which provides the large majority of the Companys earnings. The plan used five financial and operational metrics, as described below, each based on the Drilling Divisions performance. The bonus pool could be as low as zero or as high as 200% of target depending on the achievement of the metrics shown below.  Based on the 2010 results shown below, the pool was funded at 104.6%.

After the AIP pool was funded, the CEO recommended awards for the other NEOs based on each individuals performance in 2010.  The Committee and Board reviewed such recommendations and the CEOs performance and approved the following awards for the NEOs:
________________
The 2010 Manufacturing Divisions bonus plan awards are based on performance of our subsidiary LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. (LeTourneau) against ten metrics.  These metrics address safety, profitability, return on capital employed, inventory management, and aftermarket sales, with some measures at the business unit level, and some at both the business unit and the full division level. The weight given to each metric varies depending on the employees function and scope of authority. The bonus pool could be as low as zero or as high as 200% of target depending on achievement of the metrics, and is limited to 5% of the LeTourneaus pre-tax income. Based on performance against these metrics, the aggregate funding of the 2010 Manufacturing Division bonus pool was 108% of target.
2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Awards
The NEOs target long-term incentive awards are based on a multiple of base salary. Of such value, 50% is provided in stock appreciation rights (SARs) and 50% in restricted stock, each vesting over a three-year period. The value awarded in restricted stock was further influenced by the Companys performance in 2010 against the following long-term goals, and the individuals contribution to such performance:
