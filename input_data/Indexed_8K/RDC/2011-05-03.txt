Rowan Reports First Quarter 2011 Operating Results
HOUSTON, May 3, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- For the three months ended March 31, 2011, Rowan Companies, Inc. ("Rowan" or the "Company") (NYSE: RDC) generated net income of $32.1 million or $0.25 per share, compared to $64.6 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of 2010. Revenues were $364.3 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $432.4 million in the first quarter of 2010.

The first quarter 2011 results included gains on asset disposals of $2.0 million, or $0.01 per share after tax. The first quarter 2010 results included a $42.0 million pre-tax charge, or $0.25 per share after tax, for estimated losses associated with non-conforming and slow-moving inventory items in the Company's Drilling Products and Systems manufacturing segment.
Rowan's drilling operations generated revenues of $250 million in the first quarter of 2011, down by 24% from the prior-year quarter due primarily to lower average day rates. The Company's gross drilling margin was 43% of revenues in the first quarter of 2011, down from 59% in the prior-year quarter. Income from drilling operations was $41.6 million in the first quarter of 2011, down by 70% from the prior-year quarter.
Rowan's manufacturing operations generated external revenues of $114.3 million in the first quarter of 2011, up by 13% over the prior-year quarter. The Company's gross manufacturing margin was 14% of revenues in the first quarter of 2011, down from 17% in the prior-year quarter. Income from manufacturing operations was $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2011, down by 68% from the prior-year quarter excluding effects of the 2010 inventory charge discussed above.
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our outlook for 2011 remains positive across all three of our businesses. Although our first quarter results fell short of expectations, the underperformance related mainly to delayed shipments at LeTourneau and some non-recurring expense items in our offshore drilling business. We expect improvements in utilization and day rates in 2011 for both our offshore and land rigs. At LeTourneau, the mining business continues to be strong, and the drilling products businesses are strengthening.
"As we have previously announced, we believe market conditions are favorable for separating our land rigs and manufacturing businesses from Rowan, and have commenced processes around both transactions. Assuming current market conditions continue, we are optimistic that we will complete both transactions in 2011."
