(LeTourneau) for $1.1 billion in cash.  The Agreement is subject only to regulatory approval, which the Company expects to obtain within 60 days.
 
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased to enter into this agreement with Joy to monetize our investment in LeTourneau.  This transaction is consistent with our stated strategy to separate non-core businesses, and we expect that most of the after-tax proceeds, estimated at approximately $875 million, will ultimately be redeployed into our offshore drilling business, either through continued growth of our high-spec jack-up fleet or expansion into the ultra-deepwater drilling segment.
 
We also expect this transaction to create additional opportunities for LeTourneau and its employees, who will become part of an organization that is focused on manufacturing and will continue to encourage further innovations in both the mining equipment and drilling systems businesses.  I want to personally thank the LeTourneau management team for the many organizational and operational improvements they have made in the company and their invaluable assistance in reaching an agreement with Joy.  I likewise want to thank all of the LeTourneau employees for their dedication and service over the years as part of the Rowan family.
