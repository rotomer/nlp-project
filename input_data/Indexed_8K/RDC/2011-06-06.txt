Whats Drivin g Demand for Higher-Spec Rigs?  
 Operators are requiring greater rig capabilities to drill more challenging wellbore designs and large pipe programs
 Deep shelf gas
 Long reach horizontals
 HPHT
 IOCs and NOCs are more focused on achieving lower wellbore costs rather than the lowest day rate
 Operators are requiring higher standards post-Macondo
