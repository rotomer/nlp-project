On September 1, 2011, Rowan Companies, Inc. (the Company) completed the previously announced disposition of all of the outstanding equity interests in the Companys land drilling business unit, Rowan Drilling Company, LLC (Rowan Drilling), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement (the Agreement) dated as of July 19, 2011, between the Company, Ensign United States Drilling (S.W.) Inc. (the Buyer) and Ensign Energy Services Inc. as guarantor of the Buyers performance under the Agreement. Rowan Drilling provides contract drilling services with its fleet of 31 land rigs.
 
As consideration for the equity interests of Rowan Drilling, the Company received approximately $510 million in cash at closing. As a post-closing working capital adjustment, the Company expects to receive approximately $30 million.  After-tax proceeds from the transaction are estimated to be approximately $370 million and will be redeployed into the Companys offshore drilling business and previously announced deepwater expansion.   Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has had a material relationship with the Buyer, other than in respect of the Agreement.
