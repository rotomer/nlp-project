As discussed in more detail in our proxy statements, in recent years Rowan Companies, Inc. (Company) has been proactive in taking decisive actions to effect numerous corporate governance improvements. A few years ago, the Company committed to engage in a process to refresh the Board of Directors (Board) by reducing the size of the Board to nine or ten members and replacing a number of members. In recent years, two new independent Board members have been added (Mr. Thomas R. Hix and Ms. Suzanne P. Nimocks), and the Board is now electing to reduce the size of the Board to ten members.  In order to facilitate these efforts, Messrs. Frederick R. Lausen and Robert E. Kramek have decided not to stand for re-election to the Board when their terms expire this year. This decision was reported to the full Board on January 31, 2012.  The Company thanks and acknowledges Messrs. Lausen and Kramek for their service and dedication and their invaluable contributions to the Company. 
(b)
 
Prior to our next stockholders meeting at which directors are elected, the Board will take formal action to reduce the size of the Board from 12 to 10.
