2012 RESTRICTED STOCK NOTICE
 
 
 
The shares represented by this certificate have been issued pursuant to the terms of the 2009 Rowan Companies, Inc. Incentive Plan and may not be sold, pledged, transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered in any manner except as is set forth in the terms of such award dated _______, 20__.
 
shall be left on deposit with the Company or the Companys stock plan administrator, along with a stock power (substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A) endorsed in blank and
Until restrictions lapse, the Restricted Share certificates
shall not be transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. No right or benefit hereunder shall in any manner be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts, liabilities, or torts of the Participant. Any purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or other encumbrance of the Restricted Shares, prior to the lapse of restrictions, that does not satisfy the requirements hereunder shall be void and unenforceable against the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of the Participants Disability or death, the Participants rights under this Notice may be exercised by the Participants guardian or the legal representative of his or her estate (or the person who acquires the rights under this Notice by bequest or inheritance or by the reason of the death of the Participant), as applicable.
 
 
 
 
Determination of the date of termination of Employment by reason of Retirement and the satisfaction of the requirements for Retirement shall be based on such evidence as the Committee may require and a determination by the Committee of such date of termination and satisfaction shall be final and controlling on all interested parties.
 
 
Determination of the date of termination of Employment by reason of Disability and the satisfaction of the requirements for Disability shall be based on such evidence as the Committee may require and a determination by the Committee of such date of termination and satisfaction shall be final and controlling on all interested parties.
 
 
Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such Employment shall be based on such evidence as the Committee may require and a determination by the Committee as to the date of such termination shall be final and controlling on all interested parties.
 
 
 
 
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
(a)     withholding from the Participant's wages or other cash payment (including the cash payment referred to in Section 7 above) made to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;
 
(b)     withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Restricted Shares either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Participant's behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent); or
 
(c)     allowing the Participant to surrender or sell to the Company or its designee a number of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Restricted Shares.
 
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in which case the Participant will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent.
 
The Participant agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer, any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock, if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
 
For Participants subject to tax in the United Kingdom, if payment or withholding of the income tax due in connection with the Restricted Shares is not made within ninety (90) days of any event giving rise to the income tax liability or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the Due Date), the amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by the Participant to the Employer, effective on the Due Date. The loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC), it will be immediately due and repayable, and the Company or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to herein or otherwise permitted under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), the Participant shall not be eligible for a loan to cover the income tax due as described above. In the event the Participant is such a director or executive officer and the income tax due is not collected from or paid by the Participant by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax will constitute a benefit to the Participant on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) will be payable. The Company or the Employer may recover any such additional income tax and NICs at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to herein or otherwise permitted under the Plan. The Participant will also be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime.

The Participant is hereby notified (i) that the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock may bear such legend or legends as the Company may refuse to register the transfer of the shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to this Notice on the stock transfer records of the Company if such proposed transfer would in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company constitute a violation of any applicable securities law and (iii) that the such shares.

Company may give related instructions to its transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of
 
 
 
 
(a)     recoup from the Participant all or a portion of the Common Stock issued or cash paid under this Notice if the Companys reported financial or operating results are materially and negatively restated within five years of the grant or payment of such amounts; and
 
(b)     recoup from the Participant if, in the Committees judgment, the Participant engaged in conduct which was fraudulent, negligent or not in good faith, and which disrupted, damaged, impaired or interfered with the business, reputation or Employees of the Company or its Affiliates or which caused a subsequent adjustment or restatement of the Companys reported financial statements, all or a portion of the Common Stock issued or cash paid under this Notice within five years of such conduct.
 
In addition, the Restricted Shares are subject to the requirements of (i) Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (regarding recovery of erroneously awarded compensation) and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) similar rules under the laws of any other jurisdiction and (iii) any policies adopted by the Company to implement such requirements, all to the extent determined by the Company in its discretion to be applicable to the Participant.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)     the Plan is established voluntarily by the company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;
 
(b)     the grant of the Restricted Shares is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Shares, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Shares, even if Restricted Shares have been granted in the past;
 
(c)     all decisions with respect to future Restricted Shares or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company.
 
(d)     the grant of Restricted Shares and the Participant's participation in the Plan shall not create a right to Employment or be interpreted as forming an Employment or service contract with the Company, the Employer or any Affiliate and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Employer or any Affiliate, as applicable, to terminate the Participant's Employment relationship (if any);
 
 
(e)     the Participant is voluntarily participating in the Plan;
 
(f)     the Restricted Shares and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Shares are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
 
(g)     the Restricted Shares and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Shares are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments;
 
(h)     the future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
 
(i)     no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Shares resulting from the termination of Participant's Employment or other service relationship to the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is employed or the terms of the Participant's employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the Restricted Shares to which the Participant is otherwise not entitled, the Participant irrevocably agrees never to institute any claim against the Company, its Affiliates or the Employer, waives his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and releases the Company, its Affiliates and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
 
(j)     unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Restricted Shares and the benefits evidenced by this Notice do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Shares or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of the Company; and
 
(k)     the following provisions apply only if the Participant is employed outside the United States:
 
(i)     the Restricted Shares and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Shares are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose; and
 
(ii)     neither the Company, the Employer nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Participant's local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Restricted Shares or of any amounts due to the Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Shares or the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired upon settlement.

Determination of the date of termination of Employment by reason of Disability and the satisfaction of the requirements for Disability shall be based on such evidence as the Committee may require and a determination by the Committee of such date of termination and satisfaction shall be final and controlling on all interested parties.

Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in which case the Participant will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the exercised portion of the SAR, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
 
The Participant agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer, any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), the Participant shall not be eligible for a loan to cover the income tax due as described above. In the event the Participant is such a director or executive officer and the income tax due is not collected from or paid by the Participant by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax will constitute a benefit to the Participant on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) will be payable. The Company or the Employer may recover any such additional income tax and NICs at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to herein or otherwise permitted under the Plan. The Participant will also be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime.

PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARD NOTICE
 
 
See Schedule A for the manner in which the actual number of Performance Units that vest will be determined based on performance. The Performance Unit measurements and levels (threshold, target, maximum) are provided in Schedule A.
 
 
In the event of a Change in Control, the greater of the number of Performance Units (a) initially granted at target under Section 1 above or (b) based on the then-current expected level of attainment as determined by the Compensation Committee as of the date of the Change in Control shall be fully vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. Notwithstanding any provisions or definitions contained in the Plan, for purposes of the 2012-2014 Grant, a merger or other transaction shall not constitute a Change in Control if it is effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation or form of organization of the Company or the ultimate parent company of the Company and its Affiliates.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the Grant is subject to the requirements of (i) Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (regarding recovery of erroneously awarded compensation) and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) similar rules under the laws of any other jurisdiction and (iii) any policies adopted by the Company to implement such requirements, all to the extent determined by Company in its discretion to be applicable to the Participant.
 
 
 
 
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
 
 
 
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in which case the Participant will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested portion of the Performance Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
 
 
The Participant agrees to pay to the Company or the Employer, any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participants participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to pay amounts due hereunder if the Participant fails to comply with the Participants obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
 
For Participants subject to tax in the United Kingdom, if payment or withholding of the income tax due in connection with the Grant is not made within ninety (90) days of any event giving rise to the income tax liability or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the Due Date), the amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by you to the Employer, effective on the Due Date. The loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC), it will be immediately due and repayable, and the Company or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to herein or otherwise permitted under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), the Participant shall not be eligible for a loan to cover the income tax due as described above. In the event the Participant is such a director or executive officer and the income tax due is not collected from or paid by the Participant by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax will constitute a benefit to the Participant on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) will be payable. The Company or the Employer may recover any such additional income tax and NICs at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to herein or otherwise permitted under the Plan. The Participant will also be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime.
 
 
The Participant understands that the Company, the Employer and any Affiliates may hold certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participants name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance Units or any other entitlement to cash or shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participants favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (Data).
 
The Participant understands that Data will be transferred to such stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. The recipients of Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and the recipients country (, the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than the Participants country. The Participant may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting his or her human resources representative. The Participant authorizes the Company and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Plan. Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Participants participation in the Plan. The Participant may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing his or her human resources representative. Further, the Participant is providing his or her consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If the Participant does not consent, or if the Participant later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her Employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Participant's consent is that the Company would not be able to grant the Performance Units or other equity awards to the Participant or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, the Participants refusal or withdrawal of his or her consent may affect the Participants ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of the Participants refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, the Participant may contact his or her human resources representative.

SCHEDULE A
 
You have been granted Performance Units (PUs) as of March 7, 2012, each of which has a grant date target value of $100. relative to a group of peer companies (the "Peer Group"). The Peer Group currently consists of Atwood, Diamond Offshore, Ensco, Noble Corp, Seadrill and Transocean, but may be modified as deemed necessary by the Committee.
The amount ultimately payable for each PU granted, if any, is linked to the Companys Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over the 2012-2014 period. Such amount would be payable after the March 7, 2015 vesting date, and may be anywhere from $0 to $200 per unit, depending on the Companys TSR ranking during the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2014
 
While there will be no payout until after the vesting date, you will be notified of the PU notional value after the end of each annual performance period as follows:
 
January 1  December 31, 2012  25% of PU value measured
 
January 1  December 31, 2013  25% of PU value measured
 
January 1  December 31, 2014  25% of PU value measured
 
January 1, 2012  December 31, 2014  remaining 25% of PU value measured
 
Each value determined above will not be subject to further adjustment, unless deemed necessary by the Committee and only to the extent such adjustment would not cause the PUs to fail to constitute qualified performance-based compensation within the meaning of Code Section 162(m)(4)(C). As an example, if the Companys TSR ranked at the top of the Peer Group for the 2012 period, the 25% of PU value for the 2012 performance period would be measured at $50 (200% of the 25% potential value). If you are still employed with the Company on the vesting date, you would receive this value (in stock or cash) on or after the March 7, 2015 vesting date (and in any event within the period set forth in the Award Notice). If the Companys 2013 TSR ranked at the bottom of the Peer Group, the 25% of PU value for the 2013 performance period would be measured at $0, though no change would be made the value measured for 2012.
 
TSR is calculated with respect to each performance period for the Company as the result of dividing (a) the average closing price of the Common Stock for the last twenty-five (25) trading days of the applicable performance period (plus any dividends paid per share by any of the companies during the applicable performance period), less the average closing price of Common Stock for the twenty-five (25) trading days immediately preceding the performance period, by (b) the average closing price of Common Stock for the twenty-five (25) trading days immediately preceding the performance period. TSR is calculated with respect to each performance period for the companies in the Peer Group on the same basis as TSR is calculated for the Company. The Companys TSR will be interpolated between the peer ranked immediately above the Company and the peer ranked immediately below the Company. If the Company is at the bottom of the peer group for any period, there will be no performance unit value attributable to that period.
