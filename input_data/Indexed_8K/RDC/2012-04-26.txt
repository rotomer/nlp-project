Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
In February 2012, Rowan Companies, Inc. (the Company) requested the consent of the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration (MarAd) with respect to the Companys planned redomestication to the United Kingdom. MarAd had previously guaranteed certain of the Companys notes under the Title XI Federal Ship Financing Program, of which the principal amount outstanding was $226.1 million at March 31, 2012. MarAd has denied the Companys request for the continuation of the Governments loan guarantees after closing of the redomestication. As required under the make-whole provisions of the MarAd notes indenture, the Company has retired one of the notes, and expects to retire the remainder of the notes during the second and third quarters of 2012 for an aggregate of approximately $250.5 million, including principal, make-whole premiums and accrued interest.
