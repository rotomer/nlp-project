Rowan Companies, Inc. (the Company) expects the previously approved merger, pursuant to which the Company would become a subsidiary of a newly formed English public limited company to be named Rowan Companies plc, to become effective on May 4, 2012. The Company expects that Class A Ordinary Shares of Rowan Companies plc (Ordinary Shares) will be exchanged for shares of common stock of the Company in connection with the merger, and that Ordinary Shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) and made eligible for the depository and book-entry transfer services of The Depository Trust Company (DTC) under arrangements to be entered into between the Company, and DTC and its related parties. As a result of the listing of our Ordinary Shares on the NYSE, the Company also expects that it would remain eligible for continued inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.
