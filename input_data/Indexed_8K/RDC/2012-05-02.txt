HOUSTON, May 2, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- For the three months ended March 31, 2012, Rowan Companies, Inc. ("Rowan" or the "Company") (NYSE: RDC) generated net income from continuing operations of $55.5 million or $0.45 per share, compared to $26.8 million or $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2011.

Rowan's revenues were $333.5 million in the first quarter of 2012, up by 62% over the prior-year quarter due primarily to incremental activity from fleet additions and higher utilization of existing rigs between periods. The Company's operating income was $64.8 million in the first quarter of 2012, up by 81% over the prior-year quarter.
 
Costs and expenses during the first quarter of 2012 included $4.6 million of unusual or one-time items, or $0.02 per share after tax, from a write-down of the carrying value of steel remaining from a jack-up rig construction project cancelled in 2009 and transactional costs of the Company's corporate redomestication.
 
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "During the first quarter, we continued to see solid demand and increasing day rates for high specification jack-ups in most markets. We were pleased to increase our Southeast Asia presence with commitments for two additional rigs, which will bring us to four rigs in the region. Despite the short-term impact of rig relocations on operating results, we will continue to opportunistically redeploy our assets to maximize long-term returns.
 
"On the ultra-deepwater front, we are receiving very positive reactions from potential customers to our deepwater management team and the design of our drillships. Recent ultra deepwater contract fixtures have been very encouraging, and we remain confident in our decision to enter this market and in our ability to obtain attractive term contracts with customers seeking the superior operating capabilities these rigs will offer."
