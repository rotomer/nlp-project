The information included in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On May 21, 2012, the Company and Rowan UK completed the public offering of the Securities. The Notes constitute a new series of debt securities under an indenture dated as of July 21, 2009 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as amended and supplemented by the fourth supplemental indenture dated as of May 21, 2012 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture" and with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company, Rowan UK and U.S. Bank National Association, setting forth the specific terms applicable to the Notes and the Guarantee.

Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2012. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2022.

The Company may, at its option, redeem all or part of the Notes at any time or from time to time. At any time prior to March 1, 2022, the Company may redeem any or all of the Notes for an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium, if any, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on and after March 1, 2022, the Company may redeem any or all of the Notes for an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of the subordinated indebtedness of the Company and in right of payment with any of the Company's existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Company's 5% Senior Notes due 2017, 7.875% Senior Notes due 2019 and any indebtedness under the Company's senior revolving credit facility. The Notes rank effectively junior to the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of its assets constituting collateral securing that indebtedness and to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company's subsidiaries (other than indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Company). The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Rowan UK.

If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes outstanding may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal amount will become due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of the Notes outstanding will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders of the Notes. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences.

(g) Until completion of the distribution of the Securities, the Company will timely file all reports, documents and amendments to previously filed documents required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 12, 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

provided, however,
(m) The Obligors will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or that might cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Securities to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

Covenants of the Underwriters
8. . (a) The Obligors will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including any road show, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any such issuer information, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter promptly after receipt of invoices from such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; that the Obligors will not be liable under this Section 8(a) in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance
Indemnification and Contribution
provided, however,
 
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Parent by the Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, expressly for use therein (which information is specified in Section 13 hereof).
(b) Each Underwriter, severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Obligors against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company or the Parent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Obligors promptly after receipt of invoices from the Company, as the case may be, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or the Parent in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; that such indemnification or reimbursement will be available in each such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Parent by the Representatives, on behalf of such Underwriter, expressly for use therein (which information is specified in Section 13 hereof).
provided, however,
(c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against one or more indemnifying parties under such subsection, notify each indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; that the failure to so notify each such indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action will be brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies each indemnifying party thereof, each such indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with each other similarly notified indemnifying party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from each indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, each such indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, except that the Underwriters will have the right to employ counsel to represent the Underwriters who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company or the Parent under Section 8(a) if (i) the employment thereof
provided, however,
 
has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Underwriters have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters that are different from or additional to those available to the Company or the Parent and in the judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Obligors have failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Obligors. No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes (A) an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent, but if settled with the consent of each indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, each such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 8(a) or 8(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Obligors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Parent on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Obligors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Parent or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Parent and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject
 
of this Section 8(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 8(c) above).
(e) The obligations of the Obligors under this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that the Company or the Parent may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8, to the respective officers and directors of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company or the Parent (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company or the Parent), to each officer of the Obligors who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act.
9. . If any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Notes that it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters will be obligated to purchase (in the respective proportions that the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each non- defaulting Underwriter in hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Notes less the principal amount of the Notes the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in hereto) the principal amount of the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes if the total principal amount of the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total principal amount of the Notes, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in hereto. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Notes. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Parent, except for the indemnity and

If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives are obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representatives may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order that the Obligors may effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and the Obligors agree to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that, in the opinion of the Representatives, may thereby be made necessary.
Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default.
10. . Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Obligors have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any of the events described in Sections 6(j) and 6(k) of this Agreement, shall have occurred, or (iii) any other condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled.

The Obligors hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Obligors may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company or the Parent by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions.

QUALIFICATIONS
The opinions expressed in this letter are subject to the following qualifications:
It should be noted that:
a search at the Companies Registry is not capable of revealing whether or not a winding-up petition or an application for the making of an administration order has been presented or whether or not any documents have been filed with the court for the appointment of an administrator or any notice of intention to appoint an administrator has been given;
notice of a winding-up order or resolution, notice of an administration order and notice of the appointment of a receiver or administrator may not be filed at the Companies Registry immediately and there may be a delay in the relevant notice appearing on the file of the company concerned; and
a telephone enquiry of the Central Index of Winding-Up and Administration Petitions relates only to compulsory winding-up and to the appointment of an administrator by an administration order of the court and is not conclusively capable of revealing whether or not a petition in respect of a compulsory winding up, or an application for an administration order, has been presented since there may be a delay in notice of such a petition or, as the case may be, application being entered on the records of the Central Index and a petition or application presented to a County Court may not have been notified to the Central Index and so may not appear on the records at all.
We express no opinion on the effectiveness of any of the provisions of the Transaction Documents, since they are governed by the laws of the State of New York.
The opinions in paragraph 5 are subject to the effect of laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, administration, arrangement, moratorium or re-organisation or other laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally (as to which laws we express no opinion).
In respect of any agreement which has a connection with a single country other than the country whose law governs that agreement, Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations may in certain circumstances displace the governing law chosen by the parties in favour of (i) the mandatory laws of the European Community or the relevant country or (ii) the laws of the state where the performance of the contract is to take place.
In any action brought in the English courts English law as to matters of evidence and procedure would be applied.
English courts may in their discretion render judgments for a monetary amount in a currency other than sterling if they consider that it is the currency which most fairly expresses the plaintiff's loss, but such monetary amount may have to be converted into sterling for enforcement purposes.
We express no opinion as to whether any waiver by any party of its rights to immunity from legal proceedings in respect of its obligations under the Transaction Documents would be effective.
If a person is (or is controlled by or otherwise connected with another person which is) resident in, incorporated in or constituted under the laws of a country which is the subject of United Nations, European Community or United Kingdom sanctions implemented or effective in the United Kingdom, or is otherwise the target of any such sanctions, then obligations owed to or by that person may be unenforceable or void.
