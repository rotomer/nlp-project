Rowan Reports Second Quarter 2012 Operating Results
HOUSTON, Aug. 2, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- For the three months ended June 30, 2012, Rowan Companies plc ("Rowan" or the "Company") (NYSE: RDC) generated net income from continuing operations of $50.9 million or $0.41 per share, compared to $44.4 million or $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2011.

Net income from continuing operations during the second quarter of 2012 included $17.8 million of unusual or one-time items, or $0.10 per share after tax, including losses on early redemption of Marad debt and transactional costs of the Company's corporate redomestication, net of gains on asset disposals. Excluding such items, net income from continuing operations was $63.4 million or $0.51 per share during the second quarter of 2012. The prior year quarter included a net reduction of $4.7 million, or $0.03 per share after tax, from one-time charges and gains on asset disposals.
Net income totaled $49.4 million or $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2012, compared to $465.9 million or $3.65 per share in the second quarter of 2011, as the prior year quarter included income from discontinued manufacturing and land drilling operations of $421.5 million or $3.30 per share, including the after-tax gain on the sale of manufacturing operations of $424.5 million.
Rowan's revenues were $351.0 million in the second quarter of 2012, up by 57% over the prior-year quarter due primarily to incremental activity from fleet additions and higher utilization and day rates for existing rigs between periods. The Company's operating income was $70.4 million in the second quarter of 2012, up by 36% over the prior-year quarter.
Matt Ralls, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "On top of the solid results for the second quarter, we were very pleased to receive a three-year commitment for the first of our three ultra-deepwater newbuild drillships, the Rowan Renaissance, at an effective day rate ranging from $614,000 to $624,000, depending on work location. We continue to be encouraged by customer interest in these very high specification rigs."
