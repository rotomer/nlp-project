Mr. William H. Wells, the current Chief Financial Officer of Rowan Companies plc (the Company), has announced that he will retire after a transition period, expected to be within the next 30 days. The Company thanks Mr. Wells for many years of service.
 
Mr. J. Kevin Bartol will assume the position of Chief Financial Officer, in addition to his recent appointment as Executive Vice President, Finance and Corporate Development, to be effective as of Mr. Wells retirement date. Mr. Bartol, age 53, joined the Company in June 2007, serving as Vice President, Strategic Planning until March 2010, when he became Senior Vice President, Corporate Development. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Bartol was a consultant to the Company on strategic initiatives from January 2007 to June 2007. Mr. Bartols previous positions include serving as Chief Financial Officer of Jindal United Steel Corp., Chief Operating Officer of Network International, co-founder of the Saint Arnold Brewing Company and Vice-President at Simmons and Company International.
 
In addition, Mr. Bartols change in control arrangements will remain the same, which arrangements are substantially similar to the arrangements with our Named Executive Officers. The Companys executive level change in control arrangements are described in the Companys 2012 proxy statement. Mr. Bartols multiple is two times the sum of base salary and calculated bonus and his change in control agreement does not include an excise tax gross up provision.
Mr. Bartols annual base salary will remain at $400,000. Mr. Bartol will continue to participate in the Companys annual incentive plan and long-term incentive plan, with targets of 60% and 275% of base salary, respectively, remaining the same for 2012.
