Regional Offshore Rig Operating Costs Region Jack - ups Gulf of Mexico High 30s  Mid $50s Egypt Mid - High $70s Middle East Low $50s  High $70s U.K. North Sea Mid $70s  Mid $80s Norway North Sea Low - Mid $140s Southeast Asia Low $50s  Low $60s Trinidad Low  Mid $60s (000s per day) Region Drillships Gulf of Mexico $140s - $160s West Africa $180s - $200s As of 09/30/2012. Ranges exclude mobilization amortization and rebills . Daily operating costs vary by rig class and region. Higher capable rigs generally earn higher day rates and typically have higher operating costs per day. During shipyard stays, crew and other pe rso nnel - related costs are usually capitalized rather than expensed.
29 Glossary of Terms Blowout Preventer (BOP): An emergency shut - off device comprised of a series, or stack, of valves that shut the wellbore in the event that hydrocarbons enter the wellbore and pressure containment is compromised. The BOP is intended to serve as a pressure control system of last resort. Cold - stacked Rig: An offshore rig that is not actively marketed and is completely down - manned. Cold stacked rigs generally require significant time and capital expenditures to reactivate. Day rate Contract : A contractual agreement where a drilling contractor is paid a daily rate. Customer carries majority of the operating risk so long as the drilling contractor meets the basic standards of equipment and personnel specified by the contract. Estimated Planned Off Rate Time : Defined by Rowan as those days where a rig will not be available to earn any revenue due to shipyard, transit, inspection periods, or suspension of operations. High - specification Rig : Defined by Rowan as rigs with a two million pound or greater hook - load capacity. Hook - load: A commonly used metric to define the lifting capacity of a rigs drawworks and derrick system. Operational Downtime : When a rig is unable to conduct planned operations due to equipment breakdowns or procedural failures. Operational downtime may or may not result in a related revenue reduction. Utilization : A rate that specifies the percentage of time that a rig (or fleet of rigs) earned day rate in a specified period.
