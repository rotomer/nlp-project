INDEX TO EXHIBITS

EXHIBIT 99.1 July 16, 2004 REGIONS REPORTS SOLID SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS, DIVIDEND DECLARATION; MERGER INTEGRATION PROCEEDING AS PLANNED BIRMINGHAM, Ala., July 16, 2004 - Regions Financial Corp. (NYSE:RF) today reported earnings highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2004: - Healthy quarterly earnings of $162 million, or 58 cents per diluted share, including 2 cents in merger-related and other charges and a 1 cent reduction attributable to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement - In pre-merger share count terms, earnings were 72 cents per diluted share, including 3 cents in merger-related and other charges and a 1 cent reduction attributable to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement - Core earnings at record levels, reflecting increases over first quarter 2004 and second quarter 2003 - Steady core banking advances that benefited from 6 percent annualized, internal loan growth and 3 percent low-cost deposit growth, linked-quarter, annualized - Continuing improvement in nonperforming assets - down 9 percent from the first quarter - Encouraging results from major non-traditional business units, Morgan Keegan and mortgage banking - Integration initiatives related to the Regions-Union Planters merger proceeding on schedule - believe "new" Regions will be increasingly well positioned for the future - Maintaining dividend of $0.3334 per share for the third quarter as declared by the Regions Board of Directors on July 15 "Regions made good progress in the second quarter, growing loans, improving net interest income, maintaining solid credit quality and executing our merger integration plan," said Regions Chairman and CEO Carl E. Jones Jr. "We are excited about how well our two companies are coming together, and how well our business units have performed. "The trends are positive, and we are pleased with the outlook for the remainder of 2004," Jones said. Regions merged with Union Planters Corp. effective July 1, 2004. In the transaction, Regions shareholders received 1.2346 shares for each 1 share they previously owned, and Union Planters shareholders received 1 Regions share for each 1 Union Planters share they previously owned. As a result, all per-share information for prior quarters has been restated in post-merger share count terms. Net income totaled $162 million for the second quarter of 2004, or 58 cents per diluted share in post-merger share count terms. This includes 2 cents in merger-related and other charges and a 1 cent reduction related to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement (EITF 03-6) that impacts the accounting for the company's accelerated share repurchase program. Using the pre-merger share count of Regions, earnings would have been 72 cents per diluted share, including 3 cents in merger-related and other charges and 1 cent reduction related to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement.

July 16, 2004 Page Two Regions' banking operations performed very well in the second quarter. Net interest income totaled $380.9 million, compared to $379.0 million in the first quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets. Core loans increased 6 percent annualized in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter, and 5 percent compared to the second quarter of 2003. Regions' Equity AssetLine product continued to drive high-quality loan growth, as did increases in the commercial real estate portfolio. Low-cost deposits grew 3 percent on a linked-quarter, annualized basis, and 6 percent year over year as Regions' deposit acquisition campaign continued to produce positive results. "The fact that we were able to generate such steady growth in our banking division in the midst of our merger and integration efforts is a testament to the skill and dedication of our associates," said Jones. "Once again our people have played a vital role in the success of this company. "Though we still have much work to be done, our integration is underway and progressing smoothly," he said. "One of the reasons for this successful beginning is the fact that we are approaching our future as one - working together to build a strong foundation that will ensure success for many years to come." The company's non-performing assets continued to improve, declining 9 percent during the second quarter to $225.3 million, compared to $247.6 million in the first quarter. As a percentage of total loans and other real estate, non-performing assets were at 67 basis points in the second quarter, down from 75 basis points from the first quarter and 102 basis points during the same period last year. During the second quarter Morgan Keegan earned $19.4 million on total revenues of $169.8 million. Trust revenues were up 4 percent compared to the first quarter, and equity capital markets revenues were up 15 percent. Additionally, Regions' mortgage business saw an increase in originations of 41 percent, linked-quarter, driven by a strong mortgage origination pipeline at the end of the first quarter and strong growth in EquiFirst's East and West Coast operations. The Regions Financial Corp. Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 33.34 cents per share payable Aug. 16, 2004, to shareholders of record as of Aug. 2, 2004. This is the 133rd consecutive quarter in which Regions has paid cash dividends, going back to its formation in 1971. This dividend declaration is a continuation of the quarterly dividend rate (in post-merger share count terms) declared by the previous boards of directors of both Regions and Union Planters prior to the merger of the two companies. Regions will hold a conference call to discuss the company's performance today at 9 a.m. central time (CT).

As a result of this refocus in indirect lending, the balance of indirect loans held for sale was moved to the portfolio of indirect installment loans. - - Actual loans, excluding the transfer of the indirect loans held for sale, increased approximately 6% on an annualized, linked quarter basis and approximately 5% year over year. - - The transfer of indirect auto loans also affect comparisons between quarters for wholesale loans as shown above.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO SECOND QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 10 DEPOSITS *Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - Low-cost deposits grew 2.7%, annualized, compared to 1Q04, and 5.7% compared to 2Q03. Regions implemented a deposit acquisition campaign targeting DDA accounts for 2004. - - Approximately 113,000 accounts were opened in the first half of the year toward a target of 250,000 new accounts in 2004 and compared to 92,000 new accounts in the first half of 2003. - - Wholesale deposits, primarily Euro deposits and jumbo CD's, increased as they became a more attractive funding source in the quarter.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO SECOND QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 11 OPERATING PERFORMANCE *Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - The net interest margin declined from 3.56% in 1Q04 to 3.53% in 2Q04 primarily due to maturities of fixed rate assets. - - Net-interest income was up slightly based on strong earning asset growth that offset contraction in the margin. - - Regions is positioned slightly asset-sensitive at June 30, 2004.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO SECOND QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 12 NON-INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE *Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. ** Net of merger and other charges in 2Q04 - - Trust department income increased 29% compared to 2Q03 primarily as a result of the addition of RMK Timberland revenues, increases in fee levels, and higher asset values, on which fees are based. - - For the six months ended June 30, 2004, approximately 61% of Rebsamen's insurance revenues are related to the commercial property and casualty business. Approximately 29% of revenues are from the life and group life businesses. - - Insurance premiums and commissions increased over 2Q03 levels primarily as a result of new business and strong retention levels of existing clients. - - Regions derivative income is primarily connected to the conversion of fixed rate loan products into variable rate loan products. As a result, this income fluctuates based on the interest rate environment and resulting demand from customers. - - The loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in 2Q04 is related to early retirement of $1.1 billion of FHLB advances. The benefit of this prepayment is expected to be reinvested in fixed-rate funding and investment in customer relationships through greater flexibility in deposit pricing during the transition process.

Fee and commission revenue from this offering contributed approximately $5 million each to both private client and equity capital markets revenues for a total of $10 million. - - Commissions income declined $5.2 million compared to 1Q04 primarily as a result of lower levels of retail market activity in the middle to late part of the quarter as well as 1Q04 commissions related to the IPO of the RMK Strategic Income Fund. - - Principal transactions income declined $5.3 million from 1Q04 as a result of lower levels of retail activity in the middle to late part of the quarter. Principal transactions income declined 33% compared to 2Q03, which represented a historical high for Morgan Keegan's fixed income business.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO SECOND QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 14 MORGAN KEEGAN (CONTINUED) - - Investment banking revenues in 2Q03 and 1Q04 were affected by the IPOs of the RMK High Income Fund and the RMK Strategic Income Fund in each respective quarter. - - Trust income increased 15%, linked-quarter, annualized over 1Q04 as a result of an increase in corporate trust revenues and higher recent asset values on which fees are based. - - Expenses were down 12% linked quarter, annualized and 7% year over year primarily as a result of lower commissions expense. - - The decline in private client revenues compared to 1Q04 is related to the IPO of the RMK Strategic Income Fund in the first quarter as well as the previously mentioned decline in market activity in the second quarter. - - Equity capital markets revenues increased significantly in the first half of 2004, reflecting marked improvement over slower activity levels in 2003. - - Average assets per financial advisor were $59.2 million at June 30, 2004 compared to $59.4 million at March 31, 2004. - - Total customer assets were $41.5 billion at June 30, 2004, compared to $40.5 billion at March 31, 2004.

FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO SECOND QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 16 CREDIT QUALITY CREDIT QUALITY - - Annualized charge-offs were 0.34% of average loans in 2Q04 as compared to 0.17% in 1Q04 and 0.29% in 2Q03. The linked-quarter increase is related primarily to a low level of first quarter 2004 net charge-offs. - - 2Q04 commercial loan net charge-offs reflect a decline in recoveries from 1Q04 as well as a larger commercial lease that was charged off in the second quarter. - - Non-performing assets decreased $22 million or 9% linked quarter. - - Non-accrual loans were down $14.1 million compared to 1Q04 levels due to reduced inflows of loans into non-accrual status. - - At June 30, 2004, non-performing assets totaled 0.67% of loans and other real estate compared to 0.75% at March 31, 2004 and 1.02% at June 30, 2003. - - Regions non-performing loan portfolio is composed primarily of small to medium-sized loans that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. - - Of the total $188 million in non-accrual loans at June 30, 2004, approximately $66 million (35%) are secured by single-family residences, which historically have had very low levels of loss. - - The largest non-performing loan has an outstanding balance of approximately $6.5 million. - - Of the 25 largest ORE properties, the largest has a book value of $2.4 million and the smallest has a book value of $318 thousand. - - Management considers the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses from loans in the portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgments and estimates that may change in the future. Unfavorable changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the reserve, or the availability of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO SECOND QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 17 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DATA - - Regions has authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of common stock. - - Excess purchase price was $1.1 billion at June 30, 2004, March 31, 2004, and June 30, 2003. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS SECOND QUARTER 2004 ($ amounts in millions, except fully diluted per share) (1) Adjusted for July 1, 2004 merger share exchange ratio (1.2346 for 1.0), i.e., EPS calculation based on 274.564 million average diluted shares outstanding compared to pre-merger average count of 222.391 million. (2) Positive/(negative) impact on GAAP earnings.

Regions repurchased 4.0 million shares through an accelerated stock repurchase agreement which included a forward agreement, considered a participating security, entered into March 9, 2004. As the position is closed out by the counterparties, the impact will be reduced. First and second quarter 2004 earnings were reduced by $0.01 per basic and diluted share each quarter as a result of this EITF.

Other factors that may affect the accuracy of our projections are specific to Regions, including: (i) the cost and other effects of material contingencies, including litigation contingencies; (ii) our ability to expand into new markets and to maintain profit margins in the face of pricing pressures; (iii) our ability to keep pace with technological changes; (iv) our ability to develop competitive new products and services in a timely manner and the acceptance of such products and services by Regions' customers and potential Regions customers; (v) our ability to effectively manage interest rate risk and other market risk, credit risk and operational risk; (vi) our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to support our business; and (vii) our ability to achieve the earnings expectations related to the businesses that we have recently acquired or may acquire in the future, which in turn depends on a variety of factors, including: our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements with respect to acquired operations; the assimilation of acquired operations to the Regions corporate culture, including the ability to instill our credit practices and efficient approach to acquired operations; and the continued growth of the markets that the acquired entities serve, consistent with recent historical experience.
