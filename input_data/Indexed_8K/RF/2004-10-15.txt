[REGIONS FINANCIAL CORP. LOGO] OCT. 15, 2004 REGIONS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS, SOLID START FOR MERGED COMPANY BIRMINGHAM, ALA. - Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) today reported highlights for its earnings quarter ended Sept. 30, 2004, including: - Earned $0.55 per diluted share or $0.57 excluding $0.02 in merger-related charges(1) - Strong growth in loans and deposits in core banking franchise - Increased net interest income and improved net interest margin - Successfully completed three major integrations: brokerage, commercial leasing and mortgage servicing - Realized merger-related cost savings totaling approximately $6 million - Net loan losses totaling 0.30% of average loans, annualized GOOD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INTEGRATION PROGRESS "We are very encouraged by our third-quarter results, both from a financial performance standpoint and in regard to our merger integration progress," said Regions Chairman and CEO Carl E. Jones Jr., noting that earnings benefited from improved credit quality and higher net interest income. "When you look at our smooth merger conversions - mortgage servicing, commercial leasing and brokerage - and our merger integration cost savings, it becomes apparent that our associates' months of planning and hard work - and their dedication to customer service - are beginning to pay off," Jones said. "In addition, this past quarter we had to devote time, effort and resources to coping with one of the most devastating hurricane seasons in recent history. "Taken all together, what we accomplished during our first quarter as a combined company gives us a great deal to be proud of, and sets the stage for a bright future," he said. INCREASED CORE EARNINGS Third quarter 2004 net income totaled $256.7 million which is $0.55 per diluted share or $0.57 per diluted share excluding $8.7 million in after-tax merger-related charges. This year's third-quarter results reflect the effect of the merger with Union Planters Corporation, which occurred on July 1, 2004. Because the merger was accounted for as a purchase, prior period financial information for Regions (net income of $164.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share, one year ago) does not include the former Union Planters' results. GROWTH IN BANKING FRANCHISE Regions' banking operations achieved another quarter of steady growth. Net interest income increased to $676 million, compared to $369 million in the third quarter of last year. The improvement was driven by an increase in the net interest margin to 3.71% and the effect of the merger. The merger with Union Planters added approximately $30 billion in earning assets.

Oct. 15, 2004 Page 2 When compared to Regions and Union Planters on a pro forma combined basis in the second quarter, average community banking loans were up 10% linked-quarter, annualized. Home equity and commercial real estate lending drove this increase. On the same combined basis, average community banking deposits were up 4%, linked-quarter, annualized. "As business development campaigns gather traction and new training programs are implemented across Regions' expanded 15-state footprint in the South, Midwest and Texas, loan and deposit growth should further strengthen," the chairman said. "Keep in mind that hurricanes forced 465 of our banking offices to shut down an average 1.5 days during the third quarter," said Jones. "I cannot say enough about how proud we are of how our associates joined forces to quickly reopen offices and respond to customer and community needs, while at the same time continuing to successfully implement merger plans and do their day-to-day jobs. "The crisis management teams from both of our legacy organizations joined together to execute preparation and recovery plans with the speed and continuity of a group that had been together for years and not about 60 days," he noted. "This says volumes about our shared culture." IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY Third quarter credit quality trends were especially positive for Regions. Net loan charge-offs were a low 0.30% of average loans, annualized, in the third quarter of 2004. Non-performing assets totaled $462.2 million (0.81% of total loans and other real estate). FIRST MAJOR INTEGRATIONS COMPLETED SMOOTHLY; SIZABLE COST SAVINGS REALIZED "Regions' merger integration plan is firmly on track and proceeding smoothly," Jones said. During the third quarter, Union Planters' and legacy Regions' brokerage operations, commercial leasing businesses, and mortgage servicing platforms were successfully integrated. On Aug. 1, accounts held by Union Planters' former investment division were transferred to new accounts set up at Morgan Keegan & Company Inc., Regions' investment and securities brokerage, trust and asset management division. More than 25,000 former Union Planters investment customers received Morgan Keegan statements in September. In addition, Morgan Keegan opened new offices in St. Louis, Mo.; Indianapolis, Ind.; and Miami, Fla., during the third quarter. The mortgage integration, which took place at the end of the third quarter, was also successful, as evidenced by the smooth transfer of customer data from legacy Regions servicing platform to legacy Union Planters' system. Additionally, the company sold $5 billion of primarily West coast mortgage servicing rights, as well as 14 non-footprint retail mortgage production offices. "We are positioning our mortgage business for better balance between origination and servicing, which should lead to greater earnings consistency in the future," Jones noted. Regions is also on target to achieve planned merger cost savings. The company realized third quarter expense reductions approximating $6 million. The annual run-rate of cost savings is anticipated to approximate $200 million when all integrations have been accomplished. "We are committed to successfully executing our merger plans and achieving our merger objectives," Jones said. "Detailed, careful planning and a shared focus on ensuring a seamless experience for our customers are what will help us achieve these goals, and so far we are on the right track."

Oct. 15, 2004 Page 3 HEALTHY FEE REVENUES DESPITE CAPITAL MARKETS' AND MORTGAGE SLOWDOWN Morgan Keegan's revenues were $177.2 million with earnings of $19.5 million. In the third quarter, as did much of the brokerage industry, Morgan Keegan experienced lower trading volumes and lower levels of activity in both the private client retail arm of the business and the fixed income capital markets arm of the business. With the addition of Union Planters' brokerage unit, PFIC, and internal growth, customer assets grew to $44.5 billion at September 30. "We believe that Regions' strong component of fee-based businesses and revenues provides diversification and serves as a good underpinning for future growth," Jones said. "And, given our expanded footprint and broadened customer base, Morgan Keegan is increasingly well-positioned to benefit from any re-strengthening in capital markets activities." Mortgage revenues were $138 million in the third quarter. Mortgage origination volume was down in both legacy companies as they experienced declines in demand. Total mortgage production for the quarter was $3.8 billion. Jones noted that while mortgage industry market forces are currently challenging, changes under way at Regions' mortgage operations will enhance the organization's ability to compete more efficiently and profitably, as well as reduce earnings volatility over the long term.

FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 2 SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING EARNINGS RECONCILIATION TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The tables below present computations of earnings excluding certain significant items affecting financial results. These significant items are included in financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We believe the exclusion of the significant items in expressing earnings provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons. See the tables below for computation of earnings excluding significant items and corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures for periods presented. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION EARNINGS ($ in millions, except diluted per share amounts) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Positive/(negative) impact on GAAP earnings. (2) Results prior to third quarter 2004 are for legacy Regions, as the merger (accounted for as a purchase transaction) with Union Planters was not effective until July 1, 2004. However, prior period per share amounts have been restated to reflect the exchange of Regions shares in connection with the merger. Each Regions shareholder received 1.2346 shares for each 1.0 share held on July 1, 2004. (3) Effective second quarter 2004 and retroactively applied, EITF 03-6, "Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share," requires a portion of earnings to be allocated to participating securities using the two-class method described in FAS 128. Regions repurchased 4.0 million shares through an accelerated stock repurchase agreement entered into March 9, 2004 which included a forward agreement, considered a participating security. First and second quarter 2004 earnings were reduced by $0.01 per basic and diluted share each quarter as a result of the application of this EITF. As the position was closed out during the third quarter, basic and diluted EPS for the third quarter were reduced by less than $0.01 per share. COMPARISONS TO PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION Because the merger is accounted for as a purchase, prior period financial information reflects only Regions' financial results, and all the tables in this financial supplement are presented on that basis. In discussing certain financial trends discernible in the third quarter compared to prior periods, we compare actual third quarter results to prior period results on a combined basis. We believe this approach is useful for understanding period-to-period trends.

FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 11 OPERATING PERFORMANCE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REVENUE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - The net interest margin increased from 3.53% in 2Q04 to 3.71% in 3Q04 primarily due to the combination of Regions and Union Planters balance sheets at July 1, 2004, along with benefits arising from the early retirement of FHLB advances in the second quarter and the effect of purchase accounting on Union Planters' interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities - - Net-interest income increased approximately $24.7 million or 3.8% when comparing to Regions and Union Planters on a combined basis in the second quarter. Purchase accounting adjustment accounted for $8.8 million of the increase. The remainder is attributable to loan growth and the higher yields on the securities portfolio, offset somewhat by an increase in the cost of deposits. - - Regions is positioned slightly asset-sensitive at September 30, 2004, and expects to remain slightly asset sensitive for the remainder of the year
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 12 NON-INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-INTEREST INCOME NON-INTEREST EXPENSE * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. ** Net of merger and other charges in 2Q04 and 3Q04. - - Non-interest income declined $40.3 million or 7.6%, linked-quarter, when comparing to Regions and Union Planters on a combined basis in the second quarter.

Primary drivers include cost saves of approximately $6 million, $4 million in expenses related to mortgage production offices sold in the third quarter and $11 million in swaption expense savings, offset by a $12.5 million increase in EquiFirst's salaries and employee benefits expense related to increased volume of loan sales in the quarter. The effect of purchase accounting entries for amortization of intangibles ($12.6 million) and a reduction in fixed asset depreciation ($7.3 million) increased non-interest expense by $5.3 million, net.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 13 MORGAN KEEGAN - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MORGAN KEEGAN - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Summary Income Statement Breakout of Revenue by Division * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - Included in Morgan Keegan's third quarter 2004 results are $11.4 million in revenues and approximately $1.5 million in net income related to UP's brokerage unit, PFIC, as well as $8.1 million in revenues and approximately $1 million in net income related to UP Investment Advisors and UPTrust. - - The effect of adding PFIC primarily affects commissions and the private client results. - - The effect of adding UPIA and UPTrust primarily affects the trust and investment advisory areas. - - Private client was down approximately $6 million quarter over quarter on a pro forma combined basis as trading volumes remained at depressed levels. - - Fixed income and principal transactions were both down significantly quarter over quarter as fixed income market activity was at a low level throughout the third quarter. (cont. on next page)
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 14 MORGAN KEEGAN (CONTINUED) - - Investment banking revenues are largely unaffected by PFIC. They declined $5.4 million primarily as a result of fewer transactions in both the equity and debt markets. - - Equity capital markets revenues are down $2 million or 11% as a result of record low transaction volume in the national equity markets. - - RMK Trust revenues were relatively flat quarter over quarter, after adjusting for the UPTrust revenues. - - Investment advisory revenues have increased approximately $1 million when adjusting for the effect of UPIA revenues. Morgan Keegan continues to benefit from the sale of a proprietary closed end fund in the first quarter as well as its increase in wrap accounts. - - Expenses declined approximately $5.5 million when adjusting for the effect of the Union Planters-related expenses. The reduction is primarily a result of lower commissions expense. - - Average assets per financial advisor were $57.2 million at September 30, 2004 compared to $59.2 million at June 30, 2004. The decline is attributable primarily to the integration of former PFIC advisors into Morgan Keegan. - - Total customer assets were $44.5 billion at September 30, 2004, compared to $41.5 billion at June 30, 2004. Approximately $2 billion of this increase is attributable to the addition of PFIC in the quarter.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 15 MORTGAGE OPERATIONS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MORTGAGE OPERATIONS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - Mortgage production declined 32%, linked-quarter, when comparing to Regions and Union Planters on a combined basis in the second quarter, primarily as a result of industry trends and the sale of 14 out of footprint retail mortgage production offices. - - The $11.2 million increase in gain on sale of mortgage loans quarter to quarter is primarily a result of increased volume of loan sales at EquiFirst offset by premium compression and the merger. - - Regions Mortgage originates conforming mortgage loans and services loans originated in-house and by others. - - EquiFirst originates non-conforming mortgage loans primarily through a broker network and sells them servicing-released, on a whole loan basis, at a premium.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 16 CREDIT QUALITY - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CREDIT QUALITY - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - - Annualized charge-offs were a low 0.30% of average loans in 3Q04. - - Non-performing assets declined 3%, linked-quarter, when comparing to Regions and Union Planters on a combined basis in the second quarter, primarily in the non-accrual loans category. - - Loans past due greater than 90 days declined $13 million or 17%, linked-quarter, when comparing to Regions and Union Planters on a combined basis in the second quarter. - - At September 30, 2004, non-performing assets totaled 0.81% of loans and other real estate compared to 0.85% at June 30, 2004, when comparing to Regions and Union Planters on a combined basis in the second quarter. - - Regions non-performing loan portfolio is composed primarily of small to medium-sized loans that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. - - The largest non-performing loan has an outstanding balance of approximately $9 million. - - Of the 25 largest ORE properties, the largest has a book value of $3.8 million and the smallest has a book value of $366,000. - - Management considers the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses from loans in the portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgments and estimates that may change in the future. Unfavorable changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the reserve, or the availability of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 17 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DATA - - Regions has authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of common stock. - - No repurchases were made in the third quarter of 2004.

Other factors that may affect the accuracy of our projections are specific to Regions, including: (1) the cost and other effects of material contingencies, including litigation contingencies; (2) our ability to expand into new markets and to maintain profit margins in the face of pricing pressures; (3) our ability to keep pace with technological changes; (4) our ability to develop competitive new products and services in a timely manner and the acceptance of such products and services by Regions' customers and potential Regions customers; (5) our ability to effectively manage interest rate risk and other market risk, credit risk and operational risk; (6) our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to support our business; and (7) our ability to achieve the earnings expectations related to the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future, which in turn depends on a variety of factors, including: our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements with respect to acquired operations; the assimilation of acquired operations to the Regions corporate culture, including the ability to instill our credit practices and efficient approach to acquired operations; and the continued growth of the markets that the acquired entities serve, consistent with recent historical experience.
