Effective as of December 16, 2004, the registrant's board of directors amended Article III, Section 10(A) of the bylaws. Article III, Section 10(A) is a special, temporary provision relating to the size and composition of the board of directors applicable during the period from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2007. The provision was adopted pursuant to the merger agreement dated January 22, 2004, which governed the combination of Union Planters Corporation and former Regions Financial Corporation.

This amendment applies to the period from the annual meeting in 2005 through June 30, 2007. For such period, it removes the requirement that the board of directors consist of 26 members, and provides instead that the number of directors shall be fixed, from time to time, by resolutions adopted by the board of directors, and shall not be less than three persons.
