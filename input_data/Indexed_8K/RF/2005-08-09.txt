To the Representatives named in Schedule I hereto of the Under- writers named in Schedule II hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this underwriting agreement (this "Agreement"), to issue and sell $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2008 (the "Floating Rate Notes") and $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.5% Senior Notes due 2008 (the "Fixed Rate Notes" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the "Securities") to Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and the other Underwriters set forth on Schedule I attached hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representatives") are acting as representatives.
     The Securities issued in book-entry form will be issued to Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), pursuant to a letter agreement, to be dated as of the Closing Date (as defined herein) (the "DTC Agreement"), between the Company and DTC.
     The Securities will be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), in each case, between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee").
     The Indenture, the DTC Agreement and this Agreement are collectively referred to as the "Operative Agreements."
 
     The Company and certain trusts sponsored by the Company have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a joint registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-124337) and pre-effective amendment no. 1 thereto (the "Prior Registration Statement") for the registration of the Securities and certain other securities described therein under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations").

The Company and certain trusts sponsored by the Company have also filed with the Commission a joint registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-126797) for the registration of the Securities and certain other securities described therein under the 1933 Act and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415. Pursuant to Rule 429(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, such Registration Statement also constituted post-effective amendment no. 1 to the Prior Registration Statement. Such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act").

any such subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (u) No subsidiary of the Company is currently prohibited, directly or indirectly, from paying any dividends to the Company, from making any other distribution on such subsidiary's capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such subsidiary's property or assets to the Company or any other subsidiary of the Company, except as described in or contemplated by the Final Prospectus and applicable banking laws and regulations.
     (v) The Company and its Significant Subsidiaries possess all licenses, certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by the appropriate federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses, and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate, authorization or permit which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Except as set forth in the Final Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of the Significant Subsidiaries has been named as a "potentially responsible party" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended.
     (z) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, the Company (i) does not have any material lending or other relationship with any bank or lending affiliate of any of the Underwriters and (ii) does not intend to use any of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder to repay any outstanding debt owed to any affiliate of any of the Underwriters.

Agreements.
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the use of the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
     (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act or the 1934 Act Regulations, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (c) The Company will use the net proceeds received by them from the sale of the Securities in the manner specified in the Final Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds."
 
     (d) The Company, during the period when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations within the time periods required thereby.
     (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 under the 1933 Act Regulations.
     (f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the 1933 Act, as many copies of the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.

     (ii) No consent, approval, authorization, filing with or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained under the 1933 Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters in the manner contemplated in this Agreement and in the Final Prospectus and such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been obtained.
     (iii) Neither the execution and delivery of the Indenture, the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to, (A) the charter or by-laws of the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries, (B) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, or (C) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties, which violation or default would, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above, either individually or in the aggregate with all other violations and defaults referred to in this paragraph (iii) (if any), reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (iv) To the knowledge of such counsel, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or their respective property, of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Final Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, which is not described or filed as required; and the statements incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus from Item 3 of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K insofar as such statements summarize legal matters, agreements, documents or
 
proceedings discussed therein, are accurate and fair summaries of such legal matters, agreements, documents or proceedings.
     (d) The Representatives shall have received from Sidley Austin Brown & Wood , counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Operative Agreements, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus.

Incorporated on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
          8. .
Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its respective directors, each of its respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity in paragraph (a) above from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Underwriters acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting," (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of
 
the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Final Prospectus and, as applicable, in the Preliminary Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities;
 
, , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions (before deducting expenses), in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
          9.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the number of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the number of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the number of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the
Default by an Underwriter.
provided
however
 
Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
          10.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or Alabama authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination.
          11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its respective officers or trustees and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, or (2) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, or (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The ownership of Bearer Securities may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
     (e) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Registered Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Notwithstanding TIA Section 316(c), such record date shall be the record date specified in or pursuant to such Board Resolution, which shall be a date not earlier than the date 30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith and not later than the date such solicitation is completed. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than eleven months after the record date.
     (f) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
 
     (g) The Trustee, in its sole discretion, may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
     (h) With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180/th/ day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date. Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
        SECTION 105. Notices, etc., the Trustee and Company.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to or filed with,
     SECTION 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to Holders of Registered Securities by the Company or the Trustee, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each such Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any notice mailed to a Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder actually receives such notice.
     If by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable or unreliable to give such notice by mail, then such notification to Holders of Registered Securities as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder.
 
     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Bearer Securities of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given if published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and in such other city or cities as may be specified in such Securities, and if the Securities of such series are listed on any stock exchange outside the United States, in any place at which such Securities are listed on a securities exchange to the extent that such securities exchange so requires, on a Business Day, such publication to be not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once, on the date of the first such publication.
     If by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to give notice by publication to any particular Holder of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Bearer Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Registered Securities given as provided herein.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
     All notices, requests and other communications to the Trustee shall be in writing (including telecopy or similar writing or other electronic communication acceptable to the Trustee) and shall be given to the Trustee, addressed to it at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
     SECTION 107. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.
     The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
     SECTION 108. Successors and Assigns.
     All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
     SECTION 109. Separability Clause.
     In case any provision in this Indenture or in any Security or coupon shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
     SECTION 110. Benefits of Indenture.
     Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities or coupons appertaining thereto, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent and their successors hereunder and the Holders any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.
     SECTION 111. No Personal Liability.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture, in any Security or coupon appertaining thereto, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any promoter, as such, or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance of the Securities by the Holders thereof and as part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
 
     SECTION 112. Governing Law.
     This Indenture and the Securities and coupons shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. This Indenture is subject to the provisions of the TIA that are required to be part of this Indenture and shall, to the extent applicable, be governed by such provisions and any provisions of this Indenture that are not permitted by the provisions of the TIA shall be deemed to be deleted or modified to the extent such provisions are required to be deleted or modified for the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA.
     SECTION 113. Legal Holidays.
     In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any Security or the last date on which a Holder has the right to convert or exchange a Security at a particular conversion or exchange price shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or any Security or coupon other than a provision in the Securities of any series which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu hereof), payment of interest or any Additional Amounts or principal (and premium or Make- Whole Amount, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date and conversion or exchange need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date or sinking fund payment date, or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity or on such last day for conversion or exchange, provided that so long as such payment is made on the next succeeding Business Day, no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity or on such last day for conversion or exchange, as the case may be, to such next succeeding Business Day.
     SECTION 201. Forms of Securities.
     The Registered Securities, if any, of each series and the Bearer Securities, if any, and related coupons of each series, shall be in substantially the forms as shall be established in or pursuant to one or more indentures supplemental hereto or Board Resolutions, shall have such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture or any indenture supplemental hereto, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Securities may be listed or any Depository therefor, or to conform to usage. If temporary Securities of any series are issued as permitted by Section 304, the form thereof also shall be established as provided in the preceding sentence. If the forms of Securities and coupons, if any, of any series are established by, or by action taken pursuant to, a Board Resolution, a copy of the Board Resolution together with an appropriate record of any such action taken pursuant thereto, including a copy of the approved form of Securities or coupons, if any, shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 303 for the authentication and delivery of such Securities.
     Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, Bearer Securities shall have interest coupons attached.
     The definitive Securities and coupons shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or produced by any combination of these methods on a steel engraved border or steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the officers of the Company executing such Securities or coupons, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities or coupons.
     SECTION 202. Form of Trustee's Certificate of Authentication.
     Subject to Section 611, the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be in substantially the following form:
   This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     SECTION 203. Securities Issuable in Global Form.
     If Securities of or within a series are issuable in global form, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, then, notwithstanding clause (8) of Section 301 and the provisions of Section 302, any such Security shall represent such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities of such series from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities of such series represented thereby may from time to time be increased or decreased to reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon written instruction given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303 or 304. Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if applicable, Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon written instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order pursuant to Section 303 or 304 has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
     The provisions of the last sentence of Section 303 shall apply to any Security represented by a Security in global form if such Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the Security in global form together with written instructions (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence of Section 303.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 307, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, payment of principal of and any premium or Make- Whole Amount and interest on any Security in permanent global form shall be made to the Person or Persons specified therein.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 308 and except as provided in the preceding paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company and the Trustee shall treat as the Holder of such principal amount of Outstanding Securities represented by a permanent global Security (i) in the case of a permanent global Security in registered form, the Holder of such permanent global Security in registered form, or (ii) in the case of a permanent global Security in bearer form, Euroclear or Clearstream.
     SECTION 301. Amount Unlimited; Issuable in Series.
     The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
     The Securities may be issued in one or more series. There shall be established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions, or indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series, any or all of the following, as applicable (each of which (except for the matters set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (15) below), if so provided, may be determined from time to time by the Company with respect to unissued Securities of or within the series when issued from time to time):
 
 
 
     All Securities of any one series and the coupons appertaining to any Bearer Securities of such series, if any, shall be substantially identical except, in the case of Registered or Bearer Securities issued in global form, as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution or in any indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened, without the consent of the Holders, for issuances of additional Securities of such series.
     If any of the terms of the Securities of any series are established by action taken pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions, a copy of an appropriate record of such action(s) shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order for authentication and delivery of such Securities.
     SECTION 302. Denominations.
     The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. With respect to Securities of any series denominated in Dollars, in the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Registered Securities of such series, other than Registered Securities issued in global form (which may be of any denomination), shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and the Bearer Securities of such series other than Bearer Securities issued in global form (which may be of any denomination), shall be issuable in denominations of $5,000.
     SECTION 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
     The Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its President or a Vice President, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon, and attested by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities and coupons may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities.
     Securities or coupons appertaining thereto bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities or coupons.
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, together with any coupon appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; provided, however, that, in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and provided further that, unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301, a Bearer Security may be delivered in connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security shall have furnished a certificate to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, in the form set forth in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture or such other certificate as may be specified with respect to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the earlier of the date on which such Bearer Security is delivered and
 
the date on which any temporary Security first becomes exchangeable for such Bearer Security in accordance with the terms of such temporary Security and this Indenture. Except as permitted by Section 306, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured have been detached and canceled.
     If all of the Securities are not to be issued at one time and if the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities and determining the terms of particular Securities of such series, such as interest rate or formula, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 612 and TIA Section 315(a) through 315(d)) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon:
     (i) an Opinion of Counsel complying with Section 102 and stating that:
     (a) the form or forms of such Securities and any coupons have been, or will have been upon compliance with such procedures as may be specified therein, established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
     (b) the terms of such Securities and any coupons have been, or will have been upon compliance with such procedures as may be specified therein, established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
     (c) such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, when completed pursuant to such procedures as may be specified therein, and executed and delivered by the Company to the Trustee for authentication in accordance with this Indenture, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles and to such other matters as may be specified therein; and
(ii) an Officers' Certificate complying with Section 102 and stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the issuance of such Securities have been, or will have been upon compliance with such procedures as may be specified therein, complied with and that, to the best of the knowledge of the signers of such certificate, no Event of Default with respect to such Securities shall have occurred and be continuing.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver a Company Order, an Opinion of Counsel or an Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to the preceding paragraph at the time of issuance of each Security of such series, but such order, opinion and certificate, with appropriate modifications to cover such future issuances, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.
     The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties, obligations or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication and each Bearer Security shall be dated as of the date specified as contemplated by Section 301.
     No Security or coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security or the Security to which such coupon appertains a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued or sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
     SECTION 304. Temporary Securities.
     (a) Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form, or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers of the Company executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global form.
     Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with Section 304(b) or as otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution), if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any non-matured coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided further that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 303. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
     (b) Unless otherwise provided as contemplated in Section 301, this Section 304(b) shall govern the exchange of temporary Securities issued in global form other than through the facilities of DTC. If any such temporary Security is issued in global form, then such temporary global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to the London office of a depository or common depository (the "Common Depository"), for the benefit of Euroclear and Clearstream.
     Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary global Security (the "Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the Exchange Date, such temporary global Security shall be surrendered by the Common Depository to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of or within the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary global Security to be exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in exchange for any such temporary global Security shall be in bearer form, registered form, permanent global bearer form or permanent global registered form, or any combination thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, and, if any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial owner thereof; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, upon such presentation by the Common Depository, such temporary global Security is accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear as to the portion of such temporary global Security, if any, held for its account then to be exchanged and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream as to the portion of such temporary global Security, if any, held for its account then to be exchanged, each in the form set forth in Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture or in such other form as may be established pursuant to Section 301; and provided further that definitive Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of a temporary global Security only in compliance with the requirements of Section 303.
     Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, the interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series in a temporary global Security shall be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor following the Exchange Date when the account holder instructs Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on his behalf and delivers to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate in the form set forth in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established pursuant to Section 301), dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Exchange Date, copies of which certificate shall be available from the offices of Euroclear or Clearstream, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent appointed for such series of Securities and each Paying Agent. Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like unless such Person takes delivery of such definitive Securities in
 
person at the offices of Euroclear or Clearstream. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in exchange for any portion of a temporary global Security shall be delivered only outside the United States.
     Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on a temporary global Security on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to Euroclear or Clearstream on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear or Clearstream to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates in the form set forth in Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture (or in such other forms as may be established pursuant to Section 301), for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of Persons who are the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have each delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Interest Payment Date occurring prior to such Exchange Date in the form set forth as Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other forms as may be established pursuant to Section 301). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the certifications made pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the certification requirements of the preceding two paragraphs of this Section 304(b) and of the third paragraph of Section 303 of this Indenture and the interests of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of the temporary global Security with respect to which such certification was made will be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor on the Exchange Date or the date of certification if such date occurs after the Exchange Date, without further act or deed by such beneficial owners. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, no payments of principal or interest owing with respect to a beneficial interest in a temporary global Security will be made unless and until such interest in such temporary global Security shall have been exchanged for an interest in a definitive Security. Any interest so received by Euroclear or Clearstream and not paid as herein provided shall be returned to the Trustee prior to the expiration of two years after such Interest Payment Date in order to be repaid to the Company.
     SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or in any office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment a register for each series of Securities (the registers maintained in such office or in any such office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to collectively as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it or the Security Registrar may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The Security Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. The Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office, is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities on such Security Register as herein provided. In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register at all reasonable times and to require that a copy of the Security Register in written form be delivered to it from time to time as reasonably requested. Subject to the provisions of this Section 305, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, and containing identical terms and provisions.
     Subject to the provisions of this Section 305, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series (not in global form) may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination or denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions, upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any such Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities as contemplated by Section 301, Bearer Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered Securities.
     If (but only if) permitted as contemplated by Section 301, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency, with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, any such permitted exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of
 
such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in a permitted exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and like tenor after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, any permanent global Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this paragraph. If the depository for any permanent global Security is DTC, then, unless the terms of such global Security expressly permit such global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Securities, a global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to a nominee of DTC, or by a nominee of DTC to DTC, or to a successor to DTC for such global Security selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor to DTC. If at any time DTC notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the applicable global Security or Securities or if at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act if so required by applicable law or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor depository with respect to such global Security or Securities. If (x) a successor depository for such global Security or Securities is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such unwillingness, inability or ineligibility, (y) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the applicable series of Securities represented by such global Security or Securities advise DTC to cease acting as depository for such global Security or Securities or (z) the Company, in its sole discretion, determines at any time that all Outstanding Securities (but not less than all) of any series issued or issuable in the form of one or more global Securities shall no longer be represented by such global Security or Securities (provided, however, the Company may not make such determination during the 40-day restricted period provided by Regulation S under the Securities Act or during any other similar period during which the Securities must be held in global form as may be required by the Securities Act), then the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities of like series, rank, tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such global Security or Securities. If any beneficial owner of an interest in a permanent global Security is otherwise entitled to exchange such an interest for Securities of such series and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form and denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 301 and provided that any applicable notice provided in the permanent global Security shall have been given, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interest may be so exchanged, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent global Security. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such permanent global Security shall be surrendered for exchange by DTC or such other depository as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose; provided, however, that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date if the Security for which exchange is requested may be among those selected for redemption; and provided further that no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a permanent global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a permanent global Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such permanent global Security is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
     Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 306, 1107 or 1305 not involving any transfer.
     The Company or the Trustee, as applicable, shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security if such Security may be among those selected for redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before selection of the Securities to be redeemed under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on (A) if such Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption and (B) if such Securities are issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if such Securities are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Registered Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like tenor, provided that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surrendered for redemption, or (iv) to issue or to register the transfer or exchange of any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.
     SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
     If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee or the Company, together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them or any agent of either of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.
     If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of actual notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, with coupons corresponding to coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, pay such Security or coupon; provided, however, that payment of principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), any interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto.
     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Security of any series with its coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
 
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.
     SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
     Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 301, interest on any Registered Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 1002; provided, however, that each installment of interest on any Registered Security may at the Company's option be paid by (i) mailing a check for such interest, payable to or upon the written order of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to Section 308, to the address of such Person as it appears on the Security Register or (ii) wire transfer to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States.
     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, payment of interest may be made, in the case of a Bearer Security, by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located outside the United States.
     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301, every permanent global Security will provide that interest, if any, payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, with respect to that portion of such permanent global Security held for its account by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
     In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date and interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
     Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of section 301, any interest on any Registered Security of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
 
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
     Subject to the provisions of Section 1402 and except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of section 301, in the case of any Security which is converted or exchanged after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Security, the principal of (or premium, if any, on) which shall become due and payable, whether at a Stated Maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption, or otherwise, prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest whose Stated Maturity is on such Interest Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion or exchange, and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Security which is converted or exchanged, interest whose Stated Maturity is after the date of conversion or exchange of such Security shall not be payable.
     SECTION 308. Persons Deemed Owners.
     Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to, such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder of any Bearer Security and the Holder of any coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security or coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any global Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any depository, as a Holder, with respect to such global Security or impair, as between such depository and owners of beneficial interests in such global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of such depository (or its nominee) as Holder of such global Security.
 
     SECTION 309. Cancellation.
     All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, repayment at the option of the Holder, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and coupons and Securities and coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. If the Company shall so acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Canceled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by the Trustee and, if required in writing by the Company, the Trustee shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company, unless by a Company Order the Company directs their return to it.
     SECTION 310. Computation of Interest.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
     SECTION 311. CUSIP Numbers.
     The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption or other related material as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice or other related material may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or other related material and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
     SECTION 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
     This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect with respect to any series of Securities specified in such Company Request (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities of such series herein expressly provided for and any right to receive Additional Amounts, as provided in Section 1011), and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series, and any coupons appertaining thereto, when
     (1) either
 
and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable, sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities and such coupons not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, and any Additional Interest and Additional Amounts with respect thereto, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(2) The Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
(3) The Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series have been complied with.
     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 606, the obligations of the Company to any Authenticating Agent under Section 611 and, if money shall have been deposited with and held by the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003, shall survive.
     In the event that there are Securities of two or more series outstanding hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested in writing to do so with respect to Securities of a particular series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met.
     SECTION 402. Application of Trust Funds.
     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities, the coupons and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), and any interest and Additional Amounts for whose payment such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
     SECTION 501. Events of Default.
     Subject to any modifications, additions or deletions relating to any series of Securities as contemplated pursuant to Section 301, "Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to any particular series of Securities, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether or not it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
 
(1) default in the payment of any interest upon or any Additional Amounts payable in respect of any Security of or within that series or of any coupon appertaining thereto, when such interest, Additional Amounts or coupon becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make- Whole Amount, if any, on) any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable at its Maturity; or
(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of any Security of that series; or
(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant, agreement or warranty of the Company in this Indenture with respect to any Security of that series (other than (i) a covenant, agreement or warranty included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of Securities other than such series or (ii) a covenant, agreement or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
(5) default under a bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company, having a principal amount outstanding in excess of $50,000,000 (other than indebtedness which is non-recourse to the Company) under the terms of the instrument under which the indebtedness is issued or secured, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default shall have resulted in such indebtedness being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, without such indebtedness having been discharged, or such acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, or there being deposited with an unaffiliated depository, in trust, money in the necessary amount to discharge such indebtedness, within a period of 30 days after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default and requiring the Company to cause such indebtedness to be discharged or cause such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

(8) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
 
     As used in this Section 501, the term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, U.S. Code or any similar Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law for the relief of debtors and the term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or other similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
     SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     Unless otherwise specified in the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture relating to any series of Securities, if an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each such affected series (voting as a single class) may declare the principal and premium, if any, (or, if any Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof) of, and the Make-Whole Amount, if any, on, all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal (and premium, if any,) or specified portion thereof shall become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the currency, currency unit or composite currency in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series):
(A) all overdue installments of interest on and any Additional Amounts payable in respect of all Outstanding Securities of that series and any related coupons;
(B) the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, on) any Outstanding Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities;
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest and any Additional Amounts at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities; and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest on Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if:
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Security of any series and any related coupon when such interest or Additional Amount becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, on) any Security of any series at its Maturity, then the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities of such series and coupons, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities and coupons for principal (and premium or Make-Whole
 
Amount, if any) and interest and Additional Amounts, with interest upon any overdue principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities of such series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities of such series, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related coupons by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
     SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium or Make- Whole Amount, if any, or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise to take any and all actions authorized under the TIA in order to have any claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding and:
     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series, of principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
     (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities of such series and coupons to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee, their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee under Section 606.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, only on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' committee or other similar committee.
     SECTION 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities or Coupons.
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the Securities or coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities and coupons in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
 
     SECTION 506. Application of Money Collected.
     Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest and any Additional Amounts, upon presentation of the Securities or coupons, or both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
     FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 606,
     SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the Securities and coupons for principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest and any Additional Amounts payable, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the aggregate amounts due and payable on such Securities and coupons for principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), interest and Additional Amounts, respectively, and
     THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company.
     SECTION 507. Limitation on Suits.
     No Holder of any Security of any series or any related coupon shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
SECTION 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, Interest and Additional Amounts.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security or coupon shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest on, and any Additional Amounts in respect of, such Security or payment of such coupon on the respective due dates expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date), to convert or exchange such Securities in accordance with Article Sixteen and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
 
     SECTION 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
     If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security or coupon has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and coupons shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
     SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or coupons is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
     SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security or coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities or coupons, as the case may be.
     SECTION 512. Control by Holders of Securities.
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture,
(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and
(3) the Trustee need not take any action which might involve it in personal liability or be unduly prejudicial to the Holders of Securities of such series not joining therein (but the Trustee shall have no obligation as to the determination of such undue prejudice).
     SECTION 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series and any related coupons consent to the waiver of any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default
(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest including Additional Interest on or Additional Amounts payable in respect of any Security of such series or any related coupons, or
(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
     SECTION 514. Waiver of Stay, Usury or Extension Laws.
     The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
     SECTION 515. Undertaking for Costs.
     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of the applicable series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts payable with respect to any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) or to enforce the right to convert or exchange any Security in accordance with Article Sixteen.
     SECTION 601. Notice of Defaults.
     Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit in the manner and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), notice of such default hereunder actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security of such series, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Securities and coupons of such series; and provided further that in the case of any default or breach of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to the Securities and coupons of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series.
     SECTION 602. Certain Duties, Responsibilities and Rights of Trustee.
(a) The Trustee's duties and responsibilities under this Indenture shall be governed by the Trust Indenture Act.
(b) Subject to the provisions of TIA Section 315(a) through 315(d):
(1) except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall perform only such duties as are expressly undertaken by it to perform under this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee;
(2) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
(3) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order (other than delivery of any Security, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, to the Trustee for
 
authentication and delivery pursuant to Section 303 which shall be sufficiently evidenced as provided therein) and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;
(4) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;
(5) the Trustee may consult with counsel and as a condition to the taking, suffering or omission of any action hereunder may demand an Opinion of Counsel, and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
(6) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of Securities of any series or any related coupons pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
(7) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;
(8) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent, attorney, custodian or nominee appointed with due care by it hereunder;
(9) if the Trustee is acting as Paying Agent or Transfer Agent and Registrar hereunder, the rights, indemnities and protections afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Article VI shall also be afforded to such Paying Agent or Transfer Agent and Registrar;
(10) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default unless the Trustee shall have received written notice, or a Responsible Officer charged with the administration of this Indenture shall have actual knowledge of such Event of Default; and
(11) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture. The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     SECTION 603. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
     The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificate of authentication, and in any coupons shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities or coupons, except that the Trustee represents that it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Indenture, authenticate the Securities and perform its obligations hereunder. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.
     SECTION 604. May Hold Securities.
     The Trustee, any Paying Agent, Security Registrar, Authenticating Agent or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and coupons and, subject to Section 613 and TIA Sections 310(b) and 311, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar, Authenticating Agent or such other agent.
 
     SECTION 605. Money Held in Trust.
     Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on, or investment of, any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed in writing with the Company.
     SECTION 606. Compensation and Reimbursement.
     The Company agrees:
(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder, including extraordinary services rendered in connection with or during the continuation of a default hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
(2) to reimburse each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by it in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except to the extent any such expense, disbursement or advance may be attributable to its gross negligence or bad faith; and
(3) to indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee and each of their respective directors, officers, agents and employees for, and to hold each of them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts or the performance of its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its own gross negligence or bad faith.
     As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the payment of principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest on particular Securities or any coupons.
     When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default described in Section 501(6) and (7), such expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
     The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture or the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
     SECTION 607. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
     There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be eligible to act as Trustee under TIA Section 310(a)(1) and shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such Trustee or Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or the requirements of Federal, State, Territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Trustee or Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
     SECTION 608. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 609.
(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
 
(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
(d) If at any time:
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 613 or TIA Section 310(b) after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 607 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (i) the Company by or pursuant to a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to TIA Section 315(e), any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the requirements of Section 609.
     If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapacity, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to Securities of such series.
(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to the Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided for notices to the Holders of Securities in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
     SECTION 609. Acceptance of Appointment By Successor.
(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided for in Section 606.
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute
 
and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto, pursuant to Article Nine hereof, wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
     SECTION 610. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities or coupons shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities or coupons so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities or coupons. In case any Securities or coupons shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Securities or coupons, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee.
     SECTION 611. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
     At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption or repayment thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, a copy of which instrument shall be promptly furnished to the Company. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and, except as may otherwise be provided pursuant to Section 301, shall at all times be a bank or trust company or corporation organized and doing business and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America or of any State or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be
 
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of or within the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve in the manner set forth in Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent herein. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation including reimbursement of its reasonable expenses for its services under this Section.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the following form:
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     SECTION 612. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
     No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

     If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series. In case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of its rights and powers under the applicable Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
 
     SECTION 614. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
     If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the TIA regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
     SECTION 615. United States Patriot Act.
     The parties hereto acknowledge that, in order to comply with its obligations under the United States Patriot Act, the Trustee, like all financial institutions, is required to obtain, verify, and record certain information and documentation from the other parties hereto. Each of the parties hereby agree that they will provide the Trustee with such information as it may request in order for it to satisfy the requirements of the United States Patriot Act.
     SECTION 701. Disclosure of Names and Addresses of Holders.
     Every Holder of Securities or coupons, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent nor any Paying Agent nor any Security Registrar nor any director, officer, agent or employee of any of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of Securities or coupons in accordance with TIA Section 312, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under TIA Section 312(b).
     SECTION 702. Reports by Trustee.
     Within 60 days after March 15 of each year commencing with the first March 15 after the first issuance of Securities pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities as provided in TIA Section 313(c) a brief report dated as of such March 15 if and to the extent required by TIA Section 313(a).
     A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with the Commission and with the Company and, provided the Trustee has received written notification by the Company that any Securities are listed on any stock exchange, with each stock exchange upon which the Trustee has been so notified that such Securities are listed.

(2) file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Company with the conditions and covenants of this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations; and
(3) transmit by mail to the Holders of Securities, within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, in the manner and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Company pursuant to paragraphs (1) or (2) of this Section as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission.

     SECTION 801. Consolidations and Mergers of Company and Sales, Leases and Conveyances Permitted Subject to Certain Conditions.
     The Company may consolidate with, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets to, or merge with or into any other Person, provided that in any such case, (i) either the Company shall be the continuing entity, or the successor (if other than the Company) entity shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States or a State thereof and such successor entity shall expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and any interest (including all Additional Amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 1011) on all of the Securities, according to their tenor, the conversion or exchange rights shall be provided for in accordance with Article Sixteen, if applicable, or as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Company by supplemental indenture, complying with Article Nine hereof, satisfactory to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by such Person; (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and treating any indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary as a result thereof as having been incurred by the Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or the lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and (iii) if, as a result of any such consolidation or merger or such conveyance, transfer or lease, properties or assets of the Company would become subject to a mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance which would not be permitted by this Indenture, the Company or such successor Person, as the case may be, shall take such steps as shall be necessary effectively to secure the Securities equally and ratably with (or prior to) all indebtedness secured thereby.
     SECTION 802. Rights and Duties of Successor Corporation.
     In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance and upon any such assumption by the successor entity, such successor entity shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the party of the first part, and the predecessor entity, except in the event of a lease, shall be relieved of any further obligation under this Indenture and the Securities. Such successor entity thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company, any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor entity, instead of the Company, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such successor entity thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the Securities so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
     In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
 
     SECTION 803. Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel.
     Any consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance permitted under Section 801 is also subject to the condition that the Trustee receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance, and the assumption by any successor entity, complies with the provisions of this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
     SECTION 901. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders.
     Without the consent of any Holders of Securities or coupons, the Company, when authorized by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:
(1) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company herein and in the Securities; or
(2) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and, if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; or
(3) to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such Events of Default are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such Events of Default are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series); provided, however, that in respect of any such additional Events of Default such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of that or those series of Securities to which such additional Events of Default apply to waive such default; or
(4) to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to provide that Bearer Securities may be registrable as to principal, to change or eliminate any restrictions on the payment of principal of or any premium, Make- Whole Amount or Interest on Bearer Securities, to permit Bearer Securities to be issued in exchange for Registered Securities, to permit Bearer Securities to be issued in exchange for Bearer Securities of other authorized denominations or to permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities in uncertificated form, provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series or any related coupons in any material respect; or
(5) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of any series of Securities, provided that any such addition, change or elimination shall (i) neither (A) apply to any Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision, nor (B) modify the rights of the Holder of any such Security with respect to such provision; or (ii) become effective only when there is no Security Outstanding; or
(6) to secure the Securities; or
(7) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series and any related coupons as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, including the provisions and procedures relating to Securities convertible into or exchangeable for other securities or property of the Company; or
(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee; or
(9) to make provision with respect to the conversion or exchange rights of Holders pursuant to the requirements of Article Sixteen, including providing for the conversion or exchange of the securities into any security or property of the Company; or
 
(10) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture or to make any other changes, provided that in each case, such provisions shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series or any related coupons in any material respect; or
(11) to close this Indenture with respect to the authentication and delivery of additional series of Securities or to qualify, or maintain qualification of, this Indenture under the TIA; or
(12) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Securities pursuant to Sections 401, 1402 and 1403; provided in each case that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related coupons or any other series of Securities in any material respect.

     With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities and any related coupons under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby:
(1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of (or premium or Make- Whole Amount, if any, on) or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security; or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate or amount of interest thereon or any Additional Amounts payable in respect thereof, or any premium or Make-Whole Amount payable upon the redemption thereof, or change any obligation of the Company to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 1011 (except as contemplated by Section 801(i) and permitted by Section 901(1)), or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security or Indexed Security or Make-Whole Amount, if any, that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502 or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy pursuant to Section 504, or adversely affect any right of repayment at the option of the Holder of any Security, or change any Place of Payment where, or the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which, the principal of any Security or any premium or Make-Whole Amount or any Additional Amounts payable in respect thereof or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption or repayment at the option of the Holder, on or after the Redemption Date or the Repayment Date, as the case may be); or
(2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver with respect to such series (or compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or reduce the requirements of Section 1504 for quorum or voting; or
(3) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 513 or Section 1012, except to increase the required percentage to effect such action or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; or
(4) make any change that adversely affects the right to convert or exchange any Security as provided in Article Sixteen or pursuant to Section 301 (except as permitted by Section 901(9)) or decrease the conversion or exchange rate or increase the conversion or exchange price of any such Security.
     It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
     A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of
 
such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
     SECTION 903. Execution of Supplemental Indentures.
     In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modification thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and that all conditions precedent to the execution of such supplemental indenture have been complied with.

     SECTION 904. Effect of Supplemental Indentures.
     Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder and of any coupon appertaining thereto shall be bound thereby.

     Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.
     SECTION 906. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.
     Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
     SECTION 907. Notice of Supplemental Indentures.
     Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of Section 902, the Company shall give notice thereof to the Holders of each Outstanding Security affected, in the manner provided for in Section 106, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture.
     SECTION 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, Interest and Additional Amounts.
     The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts payable in respect of the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of such series of Securities, any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest due on and any Additional Amounts payable in respect of Bearer Securities on or before Maturity, other than Additional Amounts, if any, payable as provided in Section 1011 in respect of principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, on) such a Security, shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature. Unless otherwise specified with respect to Securities of any series pursuant to Section 301, at the option of the Company, all payments of principal may be paid by check to the registered Holder of the Registered Security or other person entitled thereto against surrender of such Security.
 
     SECTION 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
     If Securities of a series are issued as Registered Securities, the Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment or conversion, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series may be converted or exchanged in accordance with Article Sixteen, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. If Securities of a series are issued as Bearer Securities, the Company will maintain: (A) in the City of Birmingham, Alabama or in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where any Registered Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment or conversion, where any Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for exchange, where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served and where Bearer Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented or surrendered for payment or conversion in the circumstances described in the following paragraph (and not otherwise); (B) subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a Place of Payment for that series which is located outside the United States, an office or agency where Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment (including payment of any Additional Amounts payable on Securities of that series pursuant to Section 1011) or conversion; provided, however, that if the Securities of that series are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, The International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom or any other stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall so require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Securities of that series in Luxembourg, London or any other required city located outside the United States, as the case may be, so long as the Securities of that series are listed on such exchange; and (C) subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in each Place of Payment for that series located outside the United States an office or agency where any Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of each such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, except that Bearer Securities of that series and the related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment (including payment of any Additional Amounts payable on Bearer Securities of that series pursuant to Section 1011) at the offices specified in the Security, in London, England, and the Company hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such respective presentations, surrenders, notices and demands, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
     Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301, no payment of principal, premium, Make-Whole Amount or interest on or Additional Amounts in respect of Bearer Securities shall be made at any office or agency of the Company in the United States or by check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account maintained with a bank located in the United States; provided, however, that, if the Securities of a series are payable in Dollars, payment of principal of and any premium and interest on any Bearer Security (including any Additional Amounts or Make-Whole Amount payable on Securities of such series pursuant to Section 1011) shall be made at the office of the Company's Paying Agent in the City Birmingham, Alabama or the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, if (but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts or Make-Whole Amount, as the case may be, at all offices or agencies outside the United States maintained for the purpose by the Company in accordance with this Indenture, is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions.
     The Company may from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series and related coupons, if any, may be presented or surrendered for any or all of such purposes, and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
     Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301, if and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a Foreign Currency or (ii) may be payable in a Foreign Currency, or so long as it is required under any other provision of the Indenture, then the Company will maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, at least one Exchange Rate Agent.
 
     SECTION 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
     If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of any Securities and any related coupons, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), or interest on or Additional Amounts in respect of, any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal (and premium or Make- Whole Amount, if any) or interest or Additional Amounts so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities and any related coupons, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), or interest on or Additional Amounts in respect of, any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum (in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies described in the preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest or Additional Amounts, so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium, Make-Whole Amount or interest or Additional Amounts and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest on Securities or Additional Amounts in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(2) give the Trustee written notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any such payment of principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest or Additional Amounts; and
(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
     The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such sums.
     Except as otherwise provided in the Securities of any series, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest on, or any Additional Amounts in respect of, any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), interest or Additional Amounts has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company upon Company Request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment of such principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest on, or any Additional Amounts in respect of, any Security, without interest thereon, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
     SECTION 1004. [Reserved].
     SECTION 1005. Existence.
     Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect the existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the
 
Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders of Securities of any series.
     SECTION 1006. Maintenance of Properties.
     The Company will cause all of its material properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from selling or otherwise disposing of its properties in the ordinary course of its business.
     SECTION 1007. [Reserved].
     SECTION 1008. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.
     The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon it or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.
     SECTION 1009. Provision of Financial Information.
     Whether or not the Company is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will, to the extent permitted under the Exchange Act, file with the Commission the annual reports, quarterly reports and other documents which the Company would have been required to file with the Commission pursuant to such Section 13 or 15(d) (the "Financial Statements") if the Company were so subject, such documents to be filed with the Commission on or prior to the respective dates (the "Required Filing Dates") by which the Company would have been required so to file such documents if the Company were so subject.
     The Company will also in any event (x) within 15 days of each Required Filing Date file with the Trustee copies of annual reports, quarterly reports and other documents which the Company would have been required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the Company were subject to such Sections, and (y) if filing such documents by the Company with the Commission is not permitted under the Exchange Act, promptly upon written request and payment of the reasonable cost of duplication and delivery, supply copies of such documents to any prospective Holder.
     SECTION 1010. Statement as to Compliance.
     The Company will deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a brief certificate from the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer as to his or her knowledge of the Company's compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture and, in the event of any noncompliance, specifying such noncompliance and the nature and status thereof. For purposes of this Section 1010, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice under this Indenture.
     SECTION 1011. Additional Amounts.
     If any Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series or any coupon appertaining thereto Additional Amounts as may be specified as contemplated by Section 301. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context except in the case of Section 502(1), the payment of the principal of or any premium, Make-Whole Amount or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or payment of any related coupon or the net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided by the terms of such series established pursuant to Section 301 to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to such terms and express mention of the
 
payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, if the Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, at least 10 days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to that series of Securities (or if the Securities of that series will not bear interest prior to Maturity, the first day on which a payment of principal and any premium is made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal and any premium or Make-Whole Amount or interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned Officers' Certificate, the Company will furnish the Trustee and the Company's principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, with an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities of that series shall be made to Holders of Securities of that series or any related coupons who are not United States persons without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of or within the series. If any such withholding shall be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities of that series or related coupons and the Company will pay to the Trustee or such Paying Agent the Additional Amounts, if any, required by the terms of such Securities. In the event that the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall not so receive the above mentioned certificate, then the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall be entitled (i) to assume that no such withholding or deduction is required with respect to any payment of principal or interest with respect to any Securities of a series or related coupons until it shall have received a certificate advising otherwise and (ii) to make all payments of principal and interest with respect to the Securities of a series or related coupons without withholding or deductions until otherwise advised. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees and expenses) reasonably incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section or in reliance on the Company's not furnishing such an Officers' Certificate.
     SECTION 1012. Waiver of Certain Covenants.
     The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 1004 to 1009, inclusive, and with any other term, provision or condition with respect to the Securities of any series specified in accordance with Section 301 (except any such term, provision or condition which could not be amended without the consent of Holders of all Securities of such Series pursuant to Section 902), if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all outstanding Securities of such series, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
     SECTION 1013. Sale or Issuance of Capital Stock of Principal Subsidiary Bank.
Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 301 and subject to the provisions of Article Eight, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly:
     (a) sell, assign, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or permit to be issued, any shares of Capital Stock of a Principal Subsidiary Bank or any securities convertible into or rights to subscribe to such Capital Stock, unless, after giving effect to (i) such sale, pledge, assignment, transfer, disposition or issuance, and (ii) the conversion of such securities into, or exercise of such rights with respect to, such Capital Stock, the Company will own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock of each class of Capital Stock of such Principal Subsidiary Bank; or
     (b) pay any dividend in Capital Stock of a Principal Subsidiary Bank or make any other distribution in Capital Stock of a Principal Subsidiary Bank, unless the Principal Subsidiary Bank to which the transaction relates, after obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals, unconditionally guarantees payment of the principal and any premium and interest on the Securities;
, the foregoing shall not prohibit any of the following:
provided, however
 
     (1) any dispositions made by the Company or any Principal Subsidiary Bank of the Company (A) acting in a fiduciary capacity for any Person other than the Company or any Principal Subsidiary Bank of the Company or (B) to the Company or any Wholly-owned Subsidiary;
     (2) the merger or consolidation of a Principal Subsidiary Bank with and into another Principal Subsidiary Bank;
     (3) the sale, assignment, pledge, transfer or other dispositions of shares of Voting Stock of a Principal Subsidiary Bank made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company if:
     (A) the sale, assignment, pledge, transfer or other disposition is made, in the minimum amount required by law, to any Person for the purpose of the qualification of such Person to serve as a director; or
     (B) the sale, assignment, pledge, transfer or other disposition is made in compliance with an order of a court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction or as a condition imposed by any such court or regulatory authority to the acquisition by the Company or any Principal Subsidiary Bank of the Company, directly or indirectly, of any other Person; or
     (C) the sale, assignment, pledge, transfer or other disposition of Voting Stock or any other securities convertible into or rights to subscribe to Voting Stock of a Principal Subsidiary Bank, so long as:
     (i) any such transaction is made for fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the Principal Subsidiary Bank of the Company disposing of such Voting Stock or other securities or rights, and
     (ii) after giving effect to such transaction and to any potential dilution, the Company and its Wholly-owned Subsidiaries will own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the Voting Stock of such Principal Subsidiary Bank;
     (4) any Principal Subsidiary Bank from selling additional shares of Voting Stock to its shareholders at any price, so long as immediately after such sale, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, at least as great a percentage of the Voting Stock of such Principal Subsidiary Bank as the Company owned prior to such sale of additional shares; or
     (5) a pledge made or a lien created to secure loans or other extensions of credit by a Principal Subsidiary Bank subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
     SECTION 1101. Applicability of Article.
     Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
     SECTION 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
     The election of the Company to redeem any Securities, including coupons, if any shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all of the Securities or coupons, if any, of any series, the Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the giving of the notice of redemption in Section 1104 (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee, in writing, of such Redemption Date, Redemption Price and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture or pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.
 
     SECTION 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.
     If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series issued on such date with the same terms not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series. The Trustee shall make the selection from Securities of the series that are Outstanding and that have not previously been called for redemption and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities, including coupons, if any, of that series or any integral multiple thereof).
     If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion or exchange right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted or exchanged portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities which have been converted or exchanged during a selection of Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection. In any case where more than one Security is registered in the same name, the Trustee in its discretion may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered as if it were represented by one Security.
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
     SECTION 1104. Notice of Redemption.
     Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, unless a shorter period is specified by the terms of such series established pursuant to Section 301, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, but failure to give such notice in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other such Security or portion thereof.
     Any notice that is mailed to the Holders of Registered Securities in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice.
     All notices of redemption shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date;
(2) the Redemption Price, accrued interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any;
(3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amount) of the particular Security or Securities to be redeemed;
(4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the holder will receive, without a charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed;
(5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and accrued interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106, if any, will become due and payable upon each such Security, or the portion thereof, to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date;
 
(6) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities, together in the case of Bearer Securities with all coupons appertaining thereto, if any, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, or for conversion or exchange;
(7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case;
(8) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Bearer Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by all coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption or the amount of any such missing coupon or coupons will be deducted from the Redemption Price, unless security or indemnity satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee for such series and any Paying Agent is furnished;
(9) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to the redemption on this Redemption Date pursuant to Section 305 or otherwise, the last date, as determined by the Company, on which such exchanges may be made;
(10) the CUSIP number of such Security, if any, provided that neither the Company nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility for any such CUSIP number; and
(11) if applicable, that a Holder of Securities who desires to convert or exchange Securities to be redeemed must satisfy the requirements for conversion or exchange contained in such Securities, the then existing conversion or exchange price or rate and the date and time when the option to convert or exchange shall expire and the place or places where such Securities may be surrendered for conversion.
     Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's written request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
     SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.
     On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, which it may not do in the case of a sinking fund payment under Article Twelve, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.
     SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
     Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) (together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest and the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraph, upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of coupons for such interest; and provided further that except as otherwise provided with respect to Securities convertible or exchangeable into other securities or property of the Company, installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
     If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all
 
such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest (and any Additional Amounts) represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal, (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Security.
     SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.
     Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part (pursuant to the provisions of this Article or of Article Twelve) shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
     SECTION 1201. Applicability of Article.
     The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.
     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series, the cash amount of any mandatory sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
     SECTION 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
     The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of a series, (1) deliver Outstanding Securities of such series (other than any previously called for redemption) together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with all unmatured coupons appertaining thereto and (2) apply as a credit Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, as provided for by the terms of such Securities, or which have otherwise been acquired by the Company; provided that such Securities so delivered or applied as a credit have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the applicable Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
     SECTION 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
     Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for Securities of any series, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 1202, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered and credited. If such Officers'
 
Certificate shall specify an optional amount to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount therein specified. Not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 1106 and 1107.
     SECTION 1301. Applicability of Article.
     Repayment of Securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities, if any, and (except as otherwise specified by the terms of such series established pursuant to Section 301) in accordance with this Article.
     SECTION 1302. Repayment of Securities.
     Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms of such Securities, be repaid at a price equal to the principal amount thereon, together with interest, if any, thereof accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or before the Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal (or, if so provided by the terms of the Securities of any series, a percentage of the principal) of, and (except if the Repayment Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portion thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid on such date.
     SECTION 1303. Exercise of Option.
     Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof will contain an "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Securities. In order for any Security to be repaid at the option of the Holder, the Trustee must receive at the Place of Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 60 days nor later than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date (1) the Security so providing for such repayment together with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse thereof duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing) or (2) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth the name of the Holder of the Security, the principal amount of the Security, the principal amount of the Security to be repaid, the CUSIP number, if any, or a description of the tenor and terms of the Security, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby and a guarantee that the Security to be repaid, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of the Security, will be received by the Trustee not later than the third Business Day after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter; provided, however, that such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter shall only be effective if such Security and form duly completed are received by the Trustee by such third Business Day. If less than the entire principal amount of such Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the principal amount of such Security to be repaid, in increments of the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, and the denomination or denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the portion of the principal amount of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be specified. The principal amount of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized denomination of Securities of or within the series of which such Security to be repaid is a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof, exercise of the repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the Company.
 
     SECTION 1304. When Securities Presented for Repayment Become Due and Payable.
     If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article and as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such Securities shall, if the same were interest bearing, cease to bear interest and the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be repaid, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Repayment Date, the principal amount of such security so to be repaid shall be paid by the Company, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date; provided, however, that coupons whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of such coupons; and provided further that, in the case of Registered Securities, installments of interest, if any, whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable (but without interest thereon, unless the Company shall default in the payment thereof) to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
     If any Bearer Security surrendered for repayment shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Repayment Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the amount payable therefor as provided in Section 1302 an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made as provided in the preceding sentence, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons. If the principal amount of any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, such principal amount (together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to such Repayment Date) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment Date at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) set forth in such Security.
     SECTION 1305. Securities Repaid in Part.
     Upon surrender of any Registered Security which is to be repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the expense of the Company, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid.
     SECTION 1401. Applicability of Article; Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
     If, pursuant to Section 301, provision is made for either or both of (a) defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1402 or (b) covenant defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1403 to be applicable to the Securities of any series, then the provisions of such Section or Sections, as the case may be, together with the other provisions of this Article (with such modifications thereto as may be specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to any Securities), shall be applicable to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, and the Company may at its option by Board Resolution at any time, with respect to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, elect to defease such Outstanding Securities and coupons appertaining thereto pursuant to Section 1402 (if applicable) or Section 1403 (if applicable) upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article.
 
     SECTION 1402. Defeasance and Discharge.
     Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1404 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 1405 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (A) and (B) below, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1404 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 305, 306, 1002 and 1003 and with respect to the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, on such Securities as contemplated by Section 1011, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article Fourteen, the Company may exercise its option under this Section notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 1403 with respect to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto.
     SECTION 1403. Covenant Defeasance.
     Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Article 8, Sections 1005 to 1010, inclusive and Section 1013, and, if specified pursuant to Section 301, its obligations under any other covenant, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1404 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with Article 8, Sections 1005 to 1010, inclusive and Section 1013, or such other covenant, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under Section 501(4) or 501(8) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby.
     SECTION 1404. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
     The following shall be the conditions to application of Section 1402 or Section 1403 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series and any coupons appertaining thereto:

     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 301) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 1405, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1404 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of any
 
series and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
     Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Security pursuant to Section 301, if, after a deposit referred to in Section 1404(a) has been made, (a) the Holder of a Security in respect of which such deposit was made is entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 301 or the terms of such Security to receive payment in a currency or currency unit other than that in which the deposit pursuant to Section 1404(a) has been made in respect of such Security, or (b) a Conversion Event occurs in respect of the currency or currency unit in which the deposit pursuant to Section 1404(a) has been made, the indebtedness represented by such Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be deemed to have been, and will be, fully discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), and interest, if any, on such Security as the same becomes due out of the proceeds yielded by converting (from time to time as specified below in the case of any such election) the amount or other property deposited in respect of such Security into the currency or currency unit in which such Security becomes payable as a result of such election or Conversion Event based on the applicable market exchange rate for such currency or currency unit in effect on the second Business Day prior to each payment date, except, with respect to a Conversion Event, for such currency or currency unit in effect (as nearly as feasible) at the time of the Conversion Event.

     Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Section 1404 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.
     SECTION 1406. Reinstatement.
     If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or the Government Obligations, as the case may be, in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture, such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1402 or 1403 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money or Government Obligations, as the case may be, held in trust pursuant to Section 1405 with respect to such Securities and any coupons appertaining makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities or coupons to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations, as the case may be, so held in trust.

In the absence of a quorum within 30 minutes after the time appointed for any such meeting, the meeting shall, if convened at the request of Holders of Securities of such series, be dissolved. In any other case the meeting may be adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such meeting.

(i) there shall be no minimum quorum requirement for such meeting; and
(ii) the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series that vote in favor of such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be taken into account in determining whether such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action has been made, given or taken under this Indenture.

Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding of Securities shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104 and the appointment of any proxy shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104 or by having the signature of the Person executing the proxy witnessed or guaranteed by any trust company, bank or banker authorized by Section 104 to certify to the holding of Bearer Securities. Such regulations may provide that written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 104 or other proof.
(b) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Holders of Securities as provided in Section 1502(b), in which case the Company or the Holders of Securities of or within the series calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting.
(c) At any meeting each Holder of a Security of such series or proxy shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote, except as a Holder of a Security of such series or proxy.
(d) Any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series duly called pursuant to Section 1502 at which a quorum is present may be adjourned from time to time by Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting, and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

     The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be by written ballots on which shall be subscribed the signatures of the Holders of Securities of such series or of their representatives by proxy and the principal amounts and serial numbers of the Outstanding Securities of such series held or represented by them. The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record, at least in duplicate, of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders of Securities of any series shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having knowledge of the fact, setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that said notice was given as provided in Section 1502 and, if applicable, Section 1504. Each copy shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such copy shall be delivered to the Company and another to the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting. Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated.
     SECTION 1507. Evidence of Action Taken by Holders.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Holders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in
 
writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 315(a) through 315(d) of the TIA) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
     SECTION 1508. Proof of Execution of Instruments.
     Subject to TIA Sections 315(a) through 315(d), the execution of any instrument by a Holder or his agent or proxy may be proved in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee.
     SECTION 1601. Applicability of Article.
     The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are convertible or exchangeable for other securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for the Securities of such series.
     SECTION 1602. Election to Exchange; Notice to Trustee and Holders.
     The election of the Company to exchange any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. On or prior to the seventh Business Day prior to Maturity of the Securities, the Company shall provide written notice to the Holders of record of the Securities and to the Trustee and will publish a notice in a daily newspaper of national circulation stating whether the Company has made such election.
     SECTION 1603. No Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of securities shall be delivered upon exchanges of Securities of any series. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for exchange at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be delivered upon exchange shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. If, except for the provisions of this Section 1603, any Holder of a Security or Securities would be entitled to a fractional share of a security upon the exchange of such Security or Securities, or specified portions thereof, the Company shall pay to such Holder an amount in cash equal to the current market value of such fractional share computed on the basis of an average Closing Price of such security. The "Closing Price" of any security on any date of determination means, (i) if such security is listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange, the last reported sale price regular way on such exchange, (ii) if such security is not at the time so listed, as reported by the NASDAQ National Market, or (iii) if such security is not at the time so listed or reported or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange, the average of the bid and asked prices of such security in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated or similar organization if the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated is no longer reporting such information, or if not so available, the market price as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company.
     SECTION 1604. Adjustment of Exchange Rate.
     The exchange rate of Securities of any series that is exchangeable for other securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company shall be adjusted for any stock dividends, stock splits, reclassification, combinations or similar transactions or any consolidation, merger or other reorganization event in accordance with the terms of the supplemental indenture or Board Resolution setting forth the terms of the Securities of such series.
     Whenever the exchange rate is adjusted, the Company shall compute the adjusted exchange rate in accordance with terms of the applicable Board Resolution or supplemental indenture and shall prepare an Officers' Certificate setting forth the adjusted exchange rate and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall forthwith be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of exchange of Securities pursuant to Section 1002 and, if different, with the
 
Trustee. The Company shall forthwith cause a notice setting forth the adjusted exchange rate to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at its address appearing on the Security Register and to any exchange agent other than the Trustee.
     SECTION 1605. Payment of Certain Taxes Upon Exchange.
     The Company will pay any and all taxes that may be payable in respect of the transfer and delivery of shares of other securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company on exchange of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the delivery of shares of securities in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security or Securities to be exchanged, and no such transfer or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such transfer has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.
     SECTION 1606. Shares Free and Clear.
     The Company hereby warrants that upon exchange of Securities of any series, the Holder of a Security shall receive all rights held by the Company in such security for which such Security is at such time exchangeable under this Article Sixteen, free and clear of any and all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances other than, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Securities of such series, any liens, claims, charges and encumbrances which may have been placed on any such security by the prior owner thereof, prior to the time such security was acquired by the Company. Except as provided in Section 1604, the Company will pay all taxes and charges with respect to the delivery of such security delivered in exchange for Securities hereunder.
     SECTION 1607. Cancellation of Security.
     Upon receipt by the Trustee of Securities of any series delivered to it for exchange under this Article Sixteen, the Trustee shall cancel and dispose of the same as provided in Section 309.
     SECTION 1608. Duties of Trustee Regarding Exchange.
     Neither the Trustee nor any exchange agent shall at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities of any series that is exchangeable into other securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the exchange rate, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, whether herein or in any supplemental indenture, any resolutions of the Board of Directors or written instrument executed by one or more officers of the Company provided to be employed in making the same. Neither the Trustee nor any exchange agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company, or of any Securities and neither the Trustee nor any exchange agent makes any representation with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section 612, neither the Trustee nor any exchange agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any stock certificates or other securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of exchange or to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article Sixteen or in the applicable supplemental indenture, resolutions of the Board of Directors or written instrument executed by one or more duly authorized officers of the Company.
     SECTION 1609. Repayment of Certain Funds Upon Exchange.
     Any funds which at any time shall have been deposited by the Company or on its behalf with the Trustee or any other paying agent for the purpose of paying the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on any of the Securities (including funds deposited for the sinking fund referred to in Article Twelve hereof) and which shall not be required for such purposes because of the exchange of such Securities as provided in this Article Sixteen shall after such exchange be repaid to the Company by the Trustee upon the Company's written request.
 
     SECTION 1610. Exercise of Conversion Privilege.
     In order to exercise a conversion or exchange privilege, the Holder of a Security of a series with such a privilege shall surrender such Security to the Company at the office or agency maintained for that purpose pursuant to Section 1002, accompanied by written notice to the Company that the Holder elects to convert or exchange such Security or a specified portion thereof. Such notice shall also state, if different from the name or names (with address) in which the Securities are registered, the name or names in which the securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company which shall be issuable on such conversion or exchange shall be issued. Securities surrendered for conversion or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by or accompanied by instruments of transfer in forms satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the registered Holder or its attorney duly authorized in writing; and Securities so surrendered for conversion or exchange during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (excluding Securities or portions thereof called for redemption during such period) shall also be accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of such Security then being converted, and such interest shall be payable to such registered Holder notwithstanding the conversion or exchange of such Security, subject to the provisions of Section 307 relating to the payment of Defaulted Interest by the Company. As promptly as practicable after the receipt of such notice and of any payment required pursuant to a Board Resolution and, subject to Section 303, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in an Officers' Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of such series of Security, and the surrender of such Security in accordance with such reasonable regulations as the Company may prescribe, the Company shall issue and shall deliver, at the office or agency at which such Security is surrendered, to such Holder or on its written order, securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company issuable or deliverable upon the conversion or exchange of such Security (or specified portion thereof), in accordance with the provisions of such Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture, and cash as provided therein in respect of any fractional share of such common stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion or exchange. Such conversion or exchange shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which such notice and such payment, if required, shall have been received in proper order for conversion or exchange by the Company and such Security shall have been surrendered as aforesaid (unless such Holder shall have so surrendered such Security and shall have instructed the Company to effect the conversion or exchange on a particular date following such surrender and such Holder shall be entitled to convert or exchange such Security on such date, in which case such conversion or exchange shall be deemed to be effected immediately prior to the close of business on such date) and at such time the rights of the Holder of such Security as such Security Holder shall cease and the person or persons in whose name or names any securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company shall be issuable or deliverable upon such conversion or exchange shall be deemed to have become the Holder or Holders of record of the shares represented thereby. Except as set forth above and subject to the final paragraph of Section 307, no payment or adjustment shall be made upon any conversion or exchange on account of any interest accrued on the Securities surrendered for conversion or exchange or on account of any interest or dividends on the securities or property (including securities of other issuers, provided that such securities are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and such issuer is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or any successor form) for a primary offering of its securities) of the Company issued or delivered upon such conversion or exchange.
     In the case of any Security which is converted or exchanged in part only, upon such conversion or exchange the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted or unexchanged portion of such Security.
 
     SECTION 1611. Effect of Consolidation or Merger on Conversion Privilege.
     In case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into or with any other Person, or in case of any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Company or the Person formed by such consolidation or the Person into which the Company shall have been merged or the Person which shall have acquired such assets, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the Holder of each Security then outstanding of any series that is convertible into common stock of the Company shall have the right, which right shall be the exclusive conversion right thereafter available to said Holder (until the expiration of the conversion right of such Security), to convert such Security into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such consolidation, merger or sale by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the Company into which such Security might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or sale, subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Indenture, such Security and such supplemental indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in such Security. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers or sales. It is expressly agreed and understood that anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if, pursuant to such merger, consolidation or sale, holders of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company do not receive shares of common stock of the surviving corporation but receive other securities, cash or other property or any combination thereof, Holders of Securities shall not have the right to thereafter convert their Securities into common stock of the surviving corporation or the corporation which shall have acquired such assets, but rather, shall have the right upon such conversion to receive the other securities, cash or other property receivable by a holder of the number of shares of common stock of the Company into which the Securities held by such holder might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or sale, all as more fully provided in the first sentence of this Section 1611. Anything in this Section 1611 to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this Section 1611 shall not apply to a merger or consolidation of another corporation with or into the Company pursuant to which both of the following conditions are applicable: (i) the Company is the surviving corporation and (ii) the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company are not changed or converted into any other securities or property (including cash) or changed in number or character or reclassified pursuant to the terms of such merger or consolidation.
     As evidence of the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) into which Securities may properly be convertible after any such consolidation, merger or sale, or as to the appropriate adjustments of the conversion prices applicable with respect thereto, the Trustee shall be furnished with and may accept the certificate or opinion of an independent certified public accountant with respect thereto; and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely thereon, and shall not be responsible or accountable to any Holder of Securities for any provision in conformity therewith or approved by such independent certified accountant which may be contained in said supplemental indenture.
     This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Indenture.

[THE FOLLOWING LEGEND SHALL APPEAR ON THE FACE OF EACH GLOBAL SECURITY:
     THIS NOTE IS A SECURITY IN GLOBAL FORM ("GLOBAL SECURITY") WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 203 OF THE BASE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION (THE "DEPOSITORY") OR A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY, WHICH MAY BE TREATED BY THE COMPANY, THE TRUSTEE AND ANY AGENT THEREOF AS OWNER AND HOLDER OF THIS NOTE FOR ALL PURPOSES.
     UNLESS THIS NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TO REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY NOTE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
     UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR NOTES IN DEFINITIVE REGISTERED FORM IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES REFERRED TO IN THE BASE INDENTURE, THIS GLOBAL SECURITY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TO THE DEPOSITORY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY OR BY THE DEPOSITORY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITORY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITORY.]
 
     REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., the principal sum of four hundred million United States Dollars (U.S.$400,000,000) on August 8, 2008 (the "Maturity Date") and to pay interest thereon, from and including August 8, 2005 (the "Original Issue Date") to but excluding November 8, 2005 at the Initial Interest Rate (as defined below) and from and including November 8, 2005 to but excluding the Maturity Date, quarterly in arrears on February 8, May 8, August 8 and November 8 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), beginning on November 8, 2005, at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR (as defined below) plus 0.08% until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The initial interest rate shall be equal to LIBOR plus 0.08% per annum (the "Initial Interest Rate") as determined by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as calculation agent for this Note (the "Calculation Agent"), as described below.
     The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date (each such date, a "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date and shall otherwise be payable, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. "Business Day" shall mean any day, other than Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or Birmingham, Alabama are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. Interest on this Note at maturity shall be payable to the persons to whom principal is payable.
     Interest shall be computed based on an actual/360 day count basis (as described below). Interest payments on this Note shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the Original Issue Date or the most recent Interest Payment Date on which
 
interest has been paid to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
     If any Interest Payment Date, other than the Maturity Date, falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be the next day that is a Business Day, except if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on this Note or such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date.
     The rate of interest on this Note shall be reset quarterly (the "Interest Reset Period," and the first day of each Interest Reset Period shall be an "Interest Reset Date"). The Interest Reset Dates for this Note shall be February 8, May 8, August 8 and November 8 of each year, beginning on November 8, 2005; provided that the interest rate in effect from and including the Original Issue Date to but excluding the first Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate. If any Interest Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date shall be the next day that is a Business Day, except if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
     As used in this Note, the term "Calculation Agent" includes any successor calculation agent duly appointed by the Company. Upon the request of the Holder of this Note, the Calculation Agent shall provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that shall become effective on the next Interest Reset Date. The determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be final and binding absent manifest error.
     The Calculation Agent shall determine the Initial Interest Rate on the second London Banking Day preceding the Original Issue Date and the interest rates for each succeeding Interest Reset Period by reference to LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date, each of which is referred to herein as an "Interest Determination Date." "London Banking Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
     The interest rates for this Note shall be based on the London interbank offered rate, which is referred to as "LIBOR" herein and shall be determined by the Calculation Agent as follows:
     (i) With respect to an Interest Determination Date, LIBOR shall be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, that appears on Page 3750, or any successor page, on Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date.
 
     (ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the underwriters of the Notes other than Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.) in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Interest Determination Date shall be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Interest Determination Date shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in The City of New York (which may include affiliates of the underwriters of the Notes other than Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.), as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR determined on that Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
     Accrued interest on this Note shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360. The interest rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date shall be the applicable rate as reset on that date. The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, or if none, the Initial Interest Rate. All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on this Note shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with .000005% rounded up to .00001%), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from these calculations shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent rounded upward).
     Payments of principal shall be made upon the surrender of this Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by the Company for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or in the City of Birmingham, Alabama in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, by Dollar check drawn on, or transfer to, a Dollar account. Payments of interest on this Note may be made by Dollar check, drawn on a Dollar account, mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, or, upon written application by the Holder to the Security Registrar setting forth wire instructions not later than the relevant Record Date, by wire transfer to a Dollar account.
 
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof or an Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of one of their respective authorized signatories, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly executed and delivered under its corporate seal.
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company designated as its "Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2008" (herein called the "Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to U.S.$400,000,000, issued under an Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005, (herein called the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Base Indenture), and a Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture;" the Base Indenture, as modified and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Trustee upon such surrender by the Holder shall issue the new Notes in the requested denominations.
     No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. The Notes are not subject to redemption by the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder prior to the Stated Maturity of the Notes.
     The Notes are unsecured and rank equally among themselves and with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
     The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, increase the principal amount of the Notes by issuing additional Notes in the future on the same terms and conditions, except for any differences in the issue price and interest accrued prior to the date of issuance of the additional Notes and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes. The Notes and any additional Notes shall rank equally and ratably and shall be treated as a single series for all purposes under the Indenture.
     The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $5,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes, together with accrued interest to the date of declaration, may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also
 
contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee thereunder and offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request and the Trustee for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by any Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or interest on this Note or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or the City of Birmingham, Alabama (which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee), or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees by the Security Registrar. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to recover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose
 
name this Note is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
