Moore and the Company memorialized in a letter of understanding their agreement to certain amendments to Mr. Moore's compensation arrangements, which they believe to be consistent with Region Financial Corporation's aspirations of best governance practices. Consistent with those aspirations, Regions and Mr. Moore implemented the letter of understanding by formally amending Mr. Moore's employment agreement with Regions, in the form of an amended and restated employment agreement dated as of June 29, 2005 (the "employment agreement," filed as exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on July 6, 2005). Both the letter of understanding and the employment agreement contemplate that Company aircraft will be made available for personal use by Mr. Moore from time to time and that Mr. Moore will pay the Company for his personal use. In the employment agreement, Regions and Mr. Moore agreed to establish the arrangement by which Mr. Moore would bear the cost of his personal use of Company aircraft, subject to compliance with applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Accordingly, on November 2, 2005, Regions and Mr. Moore entered into an aircraft time sharing agreement pursuant to which Mr. Moore will pay the Company for his personal use of company aircraft. Mr. Moore will pay the Company for the actual expenses of each specific flight for: (a) fuel, oil, lubricants and other additives; (b) travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging and ground transportation; (c) hangar and tie down costs away from the aircraft's base of operation; (d) insurance obtained for the specific flight; (e) landing fees, airport taxes and similar assessments; (f) customs, foreign permit and similar fees directly related to the flight; (g) in-flight food and beverages; (h) passenger ground transportation; (i) flight planning and weather contract services; and (j) an additional charge equal to fifty percent (50%) of the expenses listed in clause (a) above. These are the only categories of expenses permitted to be paid by Mr. Moore under applicable FAA regulations. The Company and flight crew retain the authority to determine what flights may be scheduled and when a flight may be cancelled or changed for safety or maintenance reasons. This agreement will terminate on the earlier of (a) termination by mutual consent, (b) the date of Mr. Moore's termination of employment with the Company or (c) the date of Mr. Moore's death. A copy of the aircraft time sharing agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and hereby incorporated by reference. ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. (c) Exhibits.

Moore ("User"). BACKGROUND: A. Owner is the registered owner of certain civil aircraft bearing the United States Registration Numbers and of the types set forth on Exhibit A to this Agreement, which are used in a manner incidental to the Owner's business and not for common carriage (collectively, the "Aircraft" or individually an "Aircraft"); B. Owner employs fully qualified flight crews to operate the Aircraft; and C. From time to time, User may desire to share the Aircraft and flight crews with Owner for User's personal travel at User's discretion on a time sharing basis as defined in Section 91.501(c)(1) of the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FAR"). NOW, THEREFORE, Owner and User agree as follows: 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Owner agrees to share the Aircraft with User for User's personal travel at User's discretion pursuant to the provisions of FAR Section 91.501(c)(1) and to provide a fully qualified flight crew for all operations for flights scheduled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement during the period, commencing on the date of this Agreement and terminating on the earlier of (a) the termination of this Agreement by consent of Owner and User, (b) the date of User's termination of employment with Owner, or (c) the date of User's death. Owner shall have the right to add or substitute aircraft of similar type, quality, and equipment, and to remove aircraft from the fleet, from time to time during the term of this Agreement. Owner shall send User a revised Exhibit A upon each such change in the Aircraft. User accepts the risk that supplements to Exhibit A may eliminate the fleet altogether, in which event, Owner shall have no responsibility to procure additional aircraft for User's needs. 2. User shall pay Owner for each flight conducted under this Agreement the actual expenses of each specific flight as authorized by FAR Section 91.501(d) as in effect from time to time. Provided that the destination of the flight in question is within a state in which Owner or any of its subsidiaries maintains an office or branch bank, a flight shall be deemed conducted under the Agreement only for the legs of flight on which User or his designees are passengers. Otherwise, a flight shall be deemed conducted under the Agreement with respect to both (i) the legs of flight on which User
or his designees are passengers, and (ii) any legs of flight necessary to reposition the aircraft to the point of origination for the legs the on which User or his designees are passengers. On the date of this Agreement these expenses include and are limited to: a) fuel, oil, lubricants and other additives; b) travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging and ground transportation; c) hangar and tie down costs away from the Aircraft's base of operation; d) insurance obtained for the specific flight; e) landing fees, airport taxes and similar assessments; f) customs, foreign permit and similar fees directly related to the flight; g) in-flight food and beverages; h) passenger ground transportation; i) flight planning and weather contract services; j) an additional charge equal to fifty percent (50%) of the expenses listed in clause (a) above. 3. Owner will pay all expenses related to the operation of each Aircraft when incurred and will provide monthly invoices to User for the expenses enumerated in Section 2 above. User shall pay Owner for these expenses within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the related invoice. 4. In the event that User desires to use the Aircraft pursuant to this Agreement, User will so notify Owner and will provide Owner with requests for flight time and proposed flight schedules reasonably in advance of the requested flight. Requests for flight time shall be in a form mutually convenient to and agreed upon by Owner and User. In addition to proposed schedules and flight times, User shall provide at least the following information for each proposed flight at some time prior to scheduled departure as required by Owner or Owner's flight crew: a) departure point; b) destinations; c) date and time of flight; d) the identity of each anticipated passenger, including, for international flights, citizenship of each non U.S. citizen and copies establishing their right to be present in the USA, including passport, visa and immigration forms; e) the nature and extent of luggage or cargo to be carried; f) the date and time of a return flight, if any; and g) any other information concerning the proposed flight that may be pertinent or required by Owner or Owner's flight crew. 5. Owner shall have sole and exclusive authority over the scheduling of the Aircraft, including which Aircraft is used for any particular flight. Scheduling shall be conducted in accordance with Owner's corporate aircraft use policy as in effect from time to time. -2-
6. Owner shall be solely responsible for securing maintenance, preventive maintenance, and required or otherwise necessary inspections on the Aircraft and shall take such requirements into account in scheduling flights of the various Aircraft. No period of maintenance, preventive maintenance, or inspection shall be delayed or postponed for the purpose of scheduling the Aircraft, unless such maintenance or inspection can be safely conducted at a later time in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and within the sound discretion of the pilot-in-command. The pilot-in-command shall have final and complete authority to cancel any flight for any reason or condition that in his or her judgment would compromise the safety of the flight. 7. Owner shall employ, pay for, and provide to User a qualified flight crew for each flight undertaken under this Agreement. In accordance with applicable FAR, the qualified flight crew provided by Owner will exercise all of its duties and responsibilities with respect to the safety of each flight conducted under this Agreement. User agrees that the flight crew, in its sole discretion, may terminate any flight, refuse to commence any flight, or take other action that in the considered judgment of the pilot-in-command is necessitated by considerations of safety, in which event, the flight crew shall take reasonable effort to resume or reschedule the flight as soon as practicable. Without limiting the generality of Section 8, no such action of the pilot-in-command shall create or support any liability for loss, injury, damage, or delay to User or any other person. User shall at all times obey and cause each other passenger on his time share flights to obey, all crewmember instructions, placards, and safety requirements imposed by any member of the crew. 8. The Owner and User agree that Owner shall not be liable to User or any other person for loss, injury, or damage occasioned by the delay or failure to furnish the Aircraft and crew pursuant to this Agreement for any reason, including, without limitation, any and all special or consequential damages, for any reason whatsoever. 9. The risk of loss during the period when any Aircraft is operated on behalf of User under this Agreement shall remain with Owner, and Owner will retain all rights and benefits with respect to the proceeds payable under policies of hull insurance maintained by Owner that may be payable as a result of any incident or occurrence while an Aircraft is being operated on behalf of User under this Agreement. User shall be named as an additional insured on liability insurance policies maintained by Owner on the Aircraft with respect to flights conducted pursuant to this Agreement. 10. Owner will assure that a copy of this Agreement shall be carried in the Aircraft and available for review upon the request of the FAA on all flights conducted pursuant to this Agreement. -3-
