Exhibit 99.1 (REGIONS FINANCIAL CORP.(SM) LOGO) Jan. 20, 2006 REGIONS ENDS 2005 WITH STRONG EARNINGS, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES MERGER INTEGRATION AND INCREASES DIVIDEND FOR 35TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR BIRMINGHAM, ALA. - Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) today announced highlights for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2005, including: - Earnings of 62 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2005 excluding 7 cents in merger and other charges, up 2 percent linked quarter and 11 percent annually; reported earnings of 55 cents per share which includes merger and other charges (see p. 5 for additional details) - Earnings of $2.39 per share for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005, excluding merger and other charges; reported earnings of $2.15 per share - Successful merger execution, with customer base expansion - Higher net interest margin and higher net interest income - Faster core deposit growth - Lower operating expenses - Excellent credit quality - Record year and quarter for Morgan Keegan SOLID, BROAD-BASED PROGRESS "Regions' momentum continued in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a transition year of excellent overall progress and good earnings," said Regions President and Chief Executive Officer Jackson W. Moore. "I'm proud of our 2005 achievements and believe the stage is set for further positive change in 2006." "Fourth quarter's profit improvement was driven by higher net interest income, lower core expenses and strong core deposit growth," Moore noted. "During the period, we also successfully executed the final phase of our bank branch systems conversions which has freed up associates to focus fully on business development and growth. With merger integration behind us, our primary emphasis is on maximizing the franchise's profitability. "Our accomplishments in 2005 support our belief that Regions has the footprint, business mix, talent and skills to achieve higher long-term returns for our shareholders. We completed the merger integration ahead of schedule and realized our targeted cost saves. And, we made these accomplishments with virtually no negative impact to our customers. Operating leverage was improved--reflecting revenue gains and core cost containment. Outstanding balance sheet management enabled our net interest margin and net interest income to rise. Morgan Keegan, our broker-dealer operation, booked record earnings--even though the fixed income market was less favorable. "Thanks to our associates for making these successes possible. I am confident that in 2006 our team will build on the successes Regions achieved in 2005." Continued Next Page
Jan. 20, 2006 Page 2 4Q EPS UP 2 PERCENT LINKED QUARTER, UP 11 PERCENT ANNUALLY BEFORE MERGER AND OTHER CHARGES (See p. 5 for additional details) Regions' fourth quarter 2005 net income was $254 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, including after-tax merger-related and other costs of $34 million (7 cents per diluted share). This compares to third quarter's 55 cents per diluted share, including 6 cents of merger and other costs, and fourth quarter 2004's 50 cents per diluted share, including 6 cents of merger and other charges. Excluding merger and other charges, per share earnings increased 2 percent linked quarter to 62 cents from 61 cents and were 11 percent above year-ago fourth quarter's 56 cents. For the full year 2005, Regions earned a record $1 billion, or $2.15 per diluted share, including $115 million (25 cents per diluted share) in after-tax merger-related and other costs. In 2004, Regions reported net income totaling $823.8 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, including $40.5 million (10 cents per diluted share) in after-tax merger-related and other costs. Regions' July 1, 2004, merger with Union Planters Corporation was accounted for as a purchase; therefore, the former Union Planters is only included in 2004 financial data for six months compared to a full 12 months in 2005. BUILT CUSTOMER BASE WHILE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING MERGER INTEGRATION The third and final round of bank branch conversions took place in the fourth quarter--successfully concluding the merger integration earlier than initially planned. In 2005, more than 700 legacy Union Planters bank branches were smoothly converted to Regions' customer systems. As a result, Regions ended the year with more than 1,300 bank branches located in 16 states, all of which have common systems and common product offerings that will enhance customer convenience and provide operating efficiencies. Regions grew its customer base throughout this major project. Specifically, new demand deposit accounts opened exceeded accounts closed by approximately 30 percent in 2005 and Regions opened 27 percent more demand deposit accounts in 2005 than in 2004, on a combined basis. BANKING FRANCHISE GENERATES GOOD CORE DEPOSIT AND NET INTEREST INCOME GAINS "Regions' banking operations achieved good fourth quarter results despite additional yield curve flattening," Moore said. "Core deposit growth was strong and net interest income continued to increase." Average community banking deposit growth accelerated to an annualized 12 percent linked quarter. Compared to fourth quarter 2004, average community banking deposits were up 6 percent. Approximately $830 million of the $1.5 billion linked-quarter improvement was due to new account openings and balance additions in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Interest-free deposits accounted for the bulk of the increase, continuing third quarter's positive shift in funding mix which benefited Regions' net interest margin. In 2005, Regions grew interest free deposit balances by more than $2 billion. Taxable equivalent net interest income grew an annualized 4.8 percent linked quarter and 7.7 percent year-over-year fourth quarter. A respective 8 basis point and 25 basis point improvement in the net interest margin to 4.01 percent provided a boost to net interest income. During the fourth quarter, Regions sold $665 million of investment securities at a $17.6 million loss in combination with an $18 million mortgage servicing rights recapture. MORGAN KEEGAN REGISTERS RECORD PROFITS IN 2005 "Morgan Keegan achieved outstanding fourth quarter results, lifting full-year 2005 earnings to a record $102 million--22% above 2004's $84 million," Moore said. "And we are anticipating another record year in 2006 based on current market activity." On a linked quarter basis, fourth quarter revenues rose 5.8 percent (23 percent annualized), to $211 million from $199.4 million. Profits increased to $27 million from third quarter's $24.1 million, or 12 percent. Year-over-year, fourth quarter revenues and earnings were up a respective 4 percent and 13 percent. Fourth quarter 2004's results included a sizable closed-end fund IPO contribution. Continued Next Page
Jan. 20, 2006 Page 3 Morgan Keegan continued to benefit from a broad business mix. Third-to-fourth quarter improvement in fixed income and asset management-related revenues, in particular, more than offset a slowdown in the equity capital markets and trust businesses. MORTGAGE BANKING AFFECTED BY EQUIFIRST'S MARGIN SLIPPAGE EquiFirst, Regions' non-conforming mortgage operation, experienced a fourth quarter earnings pullback to $6.1 million from third quarter's record $17.3 million. Origination volume declined approximately $300 million to $2.2 billion, and loan sale volume was also down. But a significant decline in gain on sale margins primarily caused the profit drop. A flat yield curve and industry-wide competitive pressures have created ongoing margin compression. EquiFirst earned $7.3 million in fourth quarter 2004. "Profitability is likely to remain constrained until margins begin to recover," said Moore. Conforming mortgage earnings jumped to $6.1 million (excluding $18 million mortgage servicing rights reserve recapture) in the fourth quarter from third quarter's $3.5 million (excluding $32 million mortgage servicing rights reserve recapture). Profitability has been helped mainly by a reduction in mortgage servicing rights amortization expense. Origination volume declined to $1.5 billion from $1.7 billion in third quarter 2005. OPERATING EXPENSES DECLINE Regions' fourth quarter operating expenses declined to $719 million, or approximately 1.5% linked quarter, annualized, excluding mortgage servicing rights reserve recapture and merger-related and other costs. Including the mortgage servicing rights reserve recapture and merger-related and other costs, non-interest expenses increased $12.9 million linked quarter. Merger-related cost saves increased to approximately $41.5 million in the fourth quarter, up from third quarter's approximate $40 million. Total 2005 merger savings approximated $135 million--in line with earlier estimates. Full merger integration savings of at least $50 million quarterly should be realized starting first quarter 2006 as the benefit from the final bank branch conversions is realized. "In 2006, we will actively control operating costs but not to the detriment of needed investment spending," Moore stated. "Operating efficiency improvement, though, remains a major goal. We made headway in 2005, as exemplified by fourth quarter's 60.4% operating efficiency ratio versus a year earlier 62.1%, and expect further improvement this year. And since the merger integration is behind us, there should be no additional merger-related expenses." CREDIT QUALITY REMAINS EXCELLENT Credit quality was outstanding in the fourth quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, non-performing assets dropped 7.6 percent to $406.9 million (0.70 percent of loans and other real estate) from $440.5 million at Sept. 30, 2005. Resolution of a single commercial credit largely explained the decline. Non-performing assets were 10% lower than year-end 2004. Fourth quarter net loan charge-offs were $40.4 million, or an annualized 0.28 percent of average loans. This compares to third quarter's annualized 0.25 percent and year-ago fourth quarter's annualized 0.33 percent. Full year 2005 net charge-offs totaled 0.23 percent of average loans. After a fourth quarter provision for loan losses of $40 million, Regions' year-end 2005 loan loss allowance totaled $784 million, or 1.34 percent of total loans. STOCK BUYBACKS AND DIVIDEND INCREASE RETURN EXCESS CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS During the fourth quarter, Regions repurchased 3.8 million common shares at an average cost of $33.65 per share. This brought full-year 2005 buybacks to 16.6 million shares and leaves authorization to repurchase up to an additional 27.6 million shares of common stock as part of an active capital management program. As further evidence of Regions' emphasis on returning excess capital to shareholders, on Jan. 19, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a one cent increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.35 per share, Continued Next Page
Jan. 20, 2006 Page 4 payable on Feb. 15, 2006, to shareholders of record as of Feb. 1, 2006. This increased dividend marks Regions' 35th consecutive year of dividend increases and 139th consecutive quarter of paying dividends, both going back to the company's formation in 1971. Regions remained well capitalized at year-end 2005. Tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets was 6.64 percent, relatively stable compared to the 6.68 percent reported at Sept. 30, 2005.

FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END 2005 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 10 DEPOSITS DEPOSIT PORTFOLIO - PERIOD END DATA AVERAGE COMMUNITY BANKING AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - Drivers of deposit growth were interest-free deposits and commercial money market sweep accounts. - - Interest-free deposits increased 34.7%, linked-quarter, annualized, due primarily to a free checking marketing campaign and new deposits in Hurricane Katrina-affected areas. - - Money market deposits increased 22.7% linked-quarter, annualized, due primarily to an increase in the number of commercial money market sweep accounts. - - CD's greater than $100K declined due to a reduction in wholesale CD's offset by a moderate increase in retail CD's greater than $100K. - - The increase in average community bank deposits is attributable to marketing campaigns in the quarter along with an $830 million increase in average new deposits in Katrina-affected areas. - - The decline in average wholesale deposits is primarily attributable to wholesale CD's and short term Euro dollar deposits. - - The demand deposit account open/close ratio was 1.29 for the year ended December 31, 2005. - - Approximately 27% more demand deposit accounts were opened in 2005 than in 2004 (adjusting 2004 to include both Regions and Union Planters for the entire year).
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END 2005 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 11 OPERATING PERFORMANCE * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - The net interest margin increased from 3.93% in 3Q05 to 4.01% in 4Q05 primarily as a result of a favorable deposit mix change toward low-cost deposits. - - Regions is positioned slightly asset-sensitive at December 31, 2005, and expects to remain slightly asset-sensitive for the near term. - - However, when short-term rate increases begin to slow, Regions anticipates moderate compression of the net interest margin as the benefit from the lag currently experienced in deposit re-pricing diminishes. - - Linked-quarter drop in non-interest income is primarily due to EquiFirst's reduction in mortgage sales gains from third quarter's record level.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END 2005 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 12 NON-INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE NON-INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE NON-INTEREST INCOME NON-INTEREST EXPENSE * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. ** Net of merger and other charges. - - $665 million of securities were sold at a loss of $17.6 million in conjunction with the recognition of $18.0 million of mortgage servicing rights recapture. - - The $2.9 million linked quarter decline in service charges on deposit accounts is largely a result of the migration of legacy Union Planters fee structure onto legacy Regions lower fee structure post-conversion. - - Capital Factors and SOI were sold in 2Q05 and 3Q05, respectively. - - Higher linked quarter other non-interest income is attributable to several individually smaller increases including approximately $4 million in increased revenues from Albrecht & Associates, the oil and gas divestment advisory firm purchased in 2005 by Morgan Keegan, $4 million in other fees related to the sale of mortgages, a $1.1 million increase in international department income, and a $2 million increase in ATM income. - - Salaries and employee benefits expense declined primarily as a result of a decline in incremental expenses related to EquiFirst revenue production, offset somewhat by an increase in Morgan Keegan's commission expense. - - Amortization of MSR's declined as mortgage rates increased and prepayment speed assumptions declined. - - The change in other non-interest expense was due to several smaller increases including advertising, supplies, and legal and professional fees. - - Total merger cost saves in 4Q05 were $41.5 million, compared to 3Q05's approximate $40 million. - - $6.4 million of expenses related to hurricanes affecting the Regions footprint, net of insurance reimbursements, are included in 4Q05 merger-related and other charges. - - Excluding merger-related and other costs, MSR effects, and debt extinguishment loss, operating non-interest expenses were approximately $719 million in 4Q05 compared to $721 million in 3Q05.

The largest addition was a $6.5 million commercial real estate loan in Georgia. - - Regions' non-performing loan portfolio is composed primarily of small to medium-sized loans that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. - - Management considers the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses from loans in the portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgments and estimates that may change in the future. Unfavorable changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the reserve, or the availability of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END 2005 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 17 HURRICANE KATRINA UPDATE LOANS/CREDIT QUALITY - - Loans in the hardest hit areas have been placed into a separate pool to track them against the $62 million allowance for loan losses that was identified for them in 3Q05. - - For certain consumer and mortgage loans, 90 day payment extensions were granted. These extensions expired on November 30, 2005. Approximately 50% of mortgage customers continued to make payments as originally scheduled. We expect to have much better knowledge of the portfolio quality as we approach the 90 day past due point for these loans, close to the end of 1Q06.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Regions. Any such statement speaks only as of the date the statement was made. Regions undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Some factors that may affect the accuracy of our projections apply generally to the financial services industry, including: (1) the easing of restrictions on participants in the financial services industry, such as banks, securities brokers and dealers, investment companies, and finance companies, may increase our competitive pressures; (2) possible changes in interest rates may increase our funding costs and reduce our earning asset yields, thus reducing our margins; (3) possible changes in general economic and business conditions in the United States and the South, in general, and in the communities we serve, in particular, may lead to a deterioration in credit quality, thereby increasing our provisioning costs, or a reduced demand for credit, thereby reducing our earning assets; (4) the existence or exacerbation of general geopolitical instability and uncertainty, including the threat or occurrence of acts of terror or the occurrence or escalation of hostilities; (5) possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws, and regulations, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations, including changes in accounting standards, may have an adverse effect on our business; and (6) possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits could have an effect on our ability to grow our assets and to attract deposits. Other factors that may affect the accuracy of our projections are specific to Regions, including: (1) the cost and other effects of material contingencies, including litigation contingencies; (2) our ability to expand into new markets and to maintain profit margins in the face of pricing pressures; (3) our ability to keep pace with technological changes; (4) our ability to develop competitive new products and services in a timely manner and the acceptance of such products and services by Regions' customers and potential Regions customers; (5) our ability to effectively manage interest rate risk and other market risk, credit risk and operational risk; (6) our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to support our business; and (7) our ability to achieve the earnings expectations related to the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future, which in turn depends on a variety of factors, including: our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements with respect to acquired operations; the assimilation of acquired operations to the Regions corporate culture, including the ability to instill our credit practices and efficient approach to acquired operations; and the continued growth of the markets that the acquired entities serve, consistent with recent historical experience.

The following factors, among those addressed above and others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements: (1) the level and timeliness of realization, if any, of expected cost savings and revenue synergies from the merger; (2) difficulties related to the operational effects of the merger and the integration of the businesses of Regions and Union Planters, including integration of information systems and retention of key personnel; (3) disruption from the merger may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, employees or suppliers; (4) a materially adverse change in the financial condition of Regions; (5) lower than expected revenues following the merger (6) other difficulties resulting from the merger.
