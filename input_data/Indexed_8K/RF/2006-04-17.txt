INDEX TO EXHIBITS

EXHIBIT 99.1 [REGIONS FINANCIAL CORP. LOGO] April 17, 2006 REGIONS BEGINS 2006 WITH RECORD EARNINGS, CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN BUSINESS MODEL BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) today reported highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, including: o Record earnings of 64 cents per diluted share o Increased net interest margin and strong net interest income o Record-breaking Morgan Keegan profits o Excellent credit quality SOLID START, FIRM FOUNDATION "Regions' first quarter results are a very positive start to 2006 and provide a good foundation for further profit improvement," said Regions President and Chief Executive Officer Jackson W. Moore. "I am pleased with Regions' progress and believe our strategy represents a solid action plan to maximize franchise profitability and enhance long-term growth that will enable us to realize our vision of becoming the leading regional financial services company. "First quarter's earnings particularly benefited from strong net interest income, record Morgan Keegan profits, and a low level of net loan charge-offs," Moore stated. "Linked-quarter revenue comparisons were encouraging. And, we began to implement new models and programs that, over time, will enable Regions to provide better, more efficient customer service, deepen customer relationships, and more effectively capitalize on business development opportunities for all of our products. "I remain optimistic about Regions' prospects--for 2006 and beyond." RECORD FIRST QUARTER EPS First quarter 2006 net income was $295 million, or 64 cents per diluted share compared to fourth quarter 2005's 55 cents per diluted share, including 7 cents of merger and other costs, and year-ago first quarter's 51 cents per diluted share, including 6 cents of merger and other charges. Excluding merger and other charges in first quarter 2005, per share earnings increased 12 percent year-over-year. The increase was primarily a result of strong net interest income, record Morgan Keegan results and the impact of merger-related cost saves. BANKING BUSINESS PRODUCES STRONG NET INTEREST INCOME "Regions' banking operations made good progress in the first quarter," Moore said. "With the merger integration successfully completed, our associates were fully able to refocus on profitable business development and the implementation of our matrix business model." Average community banking deposits continued to increase in the seasonally challenging first quarter, after already reflecting strong growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year, the increase was 6 percent, driven by significant growth in interest-free accounts and strong retail certificate of deposit growth. Continued Next Page
April 17, 2006 Page 2 Taxable equivalent net interest income rose 10 percent linked-quarter, annualized, and 9 percent compared to first quarter 2005, helped by further net interest margin expansion. Continued disciplined balance sheet management, including a positive shift in funding mix and modest deposit price increases, lifted first quarter's net interest margin to 4.18 percent. Regions' margin improved 17 basis points compared to the fourth quarter and 34 basis points year-over-year, as deposits grew with very disciplined pricing controls. MORGAN KEEGAN'S EARNINGS REACH NEW RECORD LEVEL "Morgan Keegan's first quarter performance was impressive," Moore stated. "Earnings climbed to $41 million, including a $9 million after tax gain on the swap of NYSE seats for stock. Profits were over 50 percent higher than fourth quarter 2005's $27 million and year-ago first quarter's $26 million." Favorable equity and fixed income markets, along with a successful closed-end fund IPO and the $13 million pre-tax gain on the exchange of NYSE seats for common stock, helped boost revenue 19 percent linked quarter, to $252 million from $211 million. Revenue was 23 percent above first quarter 2005. During the quarter, Morgan Keegan continued to build out its sales force, which is expected to drive future business generation. OPERATING EXPENSE CONTROL REMAINS A PRIORITY First quarter non-interest expenses were $756 million compared to operating expenses of $719 million (excluding mortgage servicing rights reserve recapture, and merger-related and other costs) in fourth quarter 2005. In the first quarter, a $9 million mortgage servicing rights recapture was offset by an approximate $8 million loss on the call of trust preferred securities. The linked-quarter jump largely reflected seasonal increases and costs directly tied to incremental revenue production. Partially offsetting these increases was an additional $8 million of merger cost saves, which brought total quarterly integration savings to approximately $50 million, reaching Regions' target of $200 million in annualized cost saves. STRONG CREDIT QUALITY Credit quality remained very good in the first quarter, with net loan charge-offs declining to $29 million, or an annualized 0.20 percent of average loans, from fourth quarter 2005's $40 million (annualized 0.28% of average loans). Notably, first quarter charge-offs included $3 million related to borrowers located in areas hard-hit by Hurricane Katrina versus $972,000 in the preceding quarter. First quarter 2005 net loan charge-offs totaled $25 million, or an annualized 0.17% of average loans. At March 31, 2006, non-performing assets totaled $409 million (0.70 percent of loans and other real estate) compared to $407 million at year-end 2005. Total non-performing assets were 16 percent below the March 31, 2005 level. Loans past due greater than 90 days rose $5 million linked quarter largely due to the aging of delinquent Katrina-area residential mortgages. During 2005's third quarter, Regions set aside reserves approximating $62 million for estimated Katrina-related loan losses. First quarter 2006's provision for loan losses was $27.5 million, which more than covered non-Katrina-related charge-offs and resulted in a $782 million loan loss allowance (1.34 percent of loans) at March 31, 2006. Based on information currently available, Regions continues to believe the original Katrina-related reserve is adequate. ONGOING STOCK BUYBACKS Regions continued to return excess capital to shareholders through an active share repurchase program. During the first quarter, 3.7 million common shares were repurchased at an average cost of $34.36 per share. At March 31, 2006, up to an additional 23.9 million common shares can be repurchased under the company's remaining authorization. Regions' overall balance sheet and capital position remained strong. Tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets was 6.77 percent at March 31, 2006 compared to 6.64 percent at year-end 2005. Continued Next Page
