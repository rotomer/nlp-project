ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. ITEM 5.02 (b) ---- -------- Richard D. Horsley, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Regions Financial Corporation and CEO of Business Enterprises, will retire as a director of the Company effective as of the Regions-AmSouth merger closing date and will retire as an officer of the Company on December 31, 2006. In a letter to the board of directors dated August 31, 2006, Mr. Horsley stated: "After communicating with all of you, and a great deal of thought and deliberation, I have decided to retire as an officer and director of Regions. I am extremely grateful for the support you have shown for my decision. With the anticipated closing date for the Regions-AmSouth merger set for the fourth quarter and the integration planning effort well on its way under the combined leadership team, I believe that a year-end retirement is best for the Company and for me personally. During the remaining months of this year, I will continue to provide leadership and support for our Company, and will assist with the transition of my current responsibilities. I also will continue to work with the Company and you to document and formalize my decision. Upon retirement, I will be leaving at age 64 and only a couple of months shy of 35 years with this great Company. I am extremely proud of its accomplishments over that time and excited about its future. I will miss being a part of it, and most of all, I will miss my associations with this board, the Regions' management team and all of the Regions' associates."
