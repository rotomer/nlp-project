ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. Item 5.02(b) - ------------ Regions Financial Corporation has 15 directors at present. The merger agreement between Regions and AmSouth Bancorporation requires a reduction in the number of present Regions directors on the post-merger board of directors from 15 to 12 (plus up to one additional director to be added prior to the completion of the merger with the mutual agreement of Regions and AmSouth). On September 19, 2006, director Margaret H. Greene advised Regions of her decision to retire as a director, to be effective on the closing date of the merger. On September 21, 2006, Regions received a communication on behalf of director Michael S. Starnes advising of his decision to retire as a director, to be effective on the closing date of the merger. Both Ms. Greene and Mr. Starnes indicated that the approaching requirement for a reduction in the number of present Regions directors on the post-merger board of directors played a part in the timing of their decisions. As previously reported, Richard D. Horsley has communicated to Regions his decision to retire as a director, also to be effective on the closing date of the merger. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
