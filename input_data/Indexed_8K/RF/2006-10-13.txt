INDEX TO EXHIBITS

Exhibit 99.1 (REGIONS FINANCIAL CORP.(SM) LOGO) October 13, 2006 REGIONS ANNOUNCES RECORD THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS, MERGER PLANNING PROGRESS BIRMINGHAM, ALA.--Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) today reported highlights for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2006, including: - - Record earnings of 77 cents per diluted share - - Increased net interest income - - Steady loan growth - - Reduced operating expenses - - Lower net loan charge-offs - - On-schedule merger planning REPEATS RECORD-LEVEL PROFIT PERFORMANCE "Regions sustained record-level, high-quality earnings in the third quarter, resulting from associates' hard work and commitment to implement revenue enhancement and cost containment initiatives," said Regions Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jackson W. Moore. "We reduced operating expenses and achieved higher net interest income, solid fee revenues and lower credit-related costs, all of which contributed to our third quarter's bottom-line strength." "We have a strong, solid earnings base to build on and believe the soon-to-be completed AmSouth merger offers significant new opportunities to boost Regions' profits and shareholder returns over the long term. We are firmly committed to successfully executing on these opportunities, while providing superior products and services to our customers and creating a rewarding work environment for associates," Moore noted. "There was also good merger planning progress in the third quarter," according to Moore. "And, on October 3, AmSouth and Regions shareholders approved our planned merger, which paves the way for an on-target fourth quarter completion, pending regulatory approvals. "I am extremely proud of Regions' significant accomplishments and overall excellent performance since the mid-2004 merger of equals with Union Planters. Nonetheless, I believe the best is yet to come--with the merger of AmSouth and Regions." EPS UP 26 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR BEFORE MERGER AND OTHER CHARGES Third quarter 2006 net income was $352 million, or 77 cents per diluted share, an increase from second quarter 2006's record 75 cents per diluted share and up sharply from year-ago third quarter's 55 cents per share, including 6 cents of merger-related and other charges. Thus, per share earnings increased 26 percent year-over-year third quarter, excluding merger and other charges. Continued Next Page
October 13, 2006 Page 2 For the first nine months of 2006, net income totaled $992 million, or $2.16 per diluted share compared to $1.60 per diluted share, including 18 cents of merger and other charges, reported in the first nine months of 2005. The 21 percent annual rise, excluding merger and other charges, was the result of good revenue growth, realization of merger-related cost saves, and improved credit-related expenses. BANKING FRANCHISE DELIVERS GOOD RESULTS Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $15 million in the third quarter to $806 million vs. second quarter's strong $791 million. Modest asset growth and an extra day in the third quarter more than offset a three basis point dip in the net interest margin to 4.21 percent. Year-over-year third quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income rose 9 percent, largely due to 28 basis point net interest margin expansion. Regions continues to take a very disciplined approach to balance sheet management which should minimize the effect of future interest rate shifts on net interest income levels. Average total loans grew at a relatively steady pace second-to-third quarter, or an annualized 4 percent. Commercial and construction lending accounted for the bulk of the gain. Regions' money market campaign was successful, generating approximately $1.5 billion of deposits since its inception in mid-June. The increase in money market deposits was offset by a decline in interest-free and other low-cost deposit accounts, as customers continued to shift funds into higher-yielding instruments. Nonetheless, average total deposits grew 7 percent linked-quarter, annualized. Regions remains focused on carefully managing funding costs while sustaining a strong core deposit base. FEE-BASED REVENUES MAKE SOLID CONTRIBUTION Service charges on deposit accounts increased an annualized 8 percent from second quarter's robust level, primarily as a result of seasonally higher NSF fees on strong underlying base levels of service charge fees. Compared to a year-ago third quarter, service charges were up 13 percent, largely due to increased NSF fee levels. Mortgage originations were down to a still strong $4 billion in the third quarter contributing to a good third-quarter showing by Regions Mortgage. Gains on sale of mortgage loans were down as non-conforming mortgage premiums declined and early payment defaults increased. As a result, total mortgage-related profits, excluding mortgage servicing rights impairment and recapture, declined to $2.6 million in third quarter 2006 from $10.3 million in 2Q06, as weaker industry fundamentals pressured EquiFirst's revenues and earnings. Regions continues to manage the cost structure and efficiency of the mortgage business. Regions sold $310 million dollars of securities during the quarter at an approximate $8 million gain. MORGAN KEEGAN SET FOR RECORD FULL-YEAR 2006 PROFITS "Given continued strength in third quarter results, 2006 should mark another record earnings year for Morgan Keegan," Moore stated. Morgan Keegan earned $30.6 million in the third quarter, 27 percent above the comparable 2005 period. Profits declined 6 percent from second quarter's very strong $32.7 million, reflecting both seasonality and less favorable capital markets conditions. Morgan Keegan revenue totaled $231 million, rising 16 percent from third quarter 2005's $199 million but declining 3 percent compared to second quarter 2006's $239 million. The linked-quarter revenue pullback was largely due to less robust fixed income and equity capital markets business flows relative to a very strong second quarter. OPERATING EXPENSES DECLINE Non-interest expenses dipped to $715 million from second quarter's $727 million, helped by cost control initiatives rolled out earlier this year. Linked-quarter expense comparisons are impacted by an $8 million mortgage servicing rights impairment charge in the third quarter of 2006 and $10 million of mortgage Continued Next Page
October 13, 2006 Page 3 servicing rights reserve recapture in the second quarter of 2006. Excluding these items, non-interest expenses declined $30 million or 4 percent linked-quarter. Regions experienced positive operating leverage in the third quarter of 2006 as the operating efficiency ratio improved to 55.9 percent compared to 57.5 percent in the second quarter. Since third quarter 2005, Regions' operating efficiency ratio has improved 364 basis points, reflecting success in growing revenue while controlling expenses. NET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS DROP Credit quality trends were broadly favorable in the third quarter. Net loan charge-offs declined to $24 million, or an annualized 0.16 percent of average loans, from second quarter's $31 million (annualized 0.21 percent of average loans). Net charge-offs were down 34 percent from a year-ago third quarter's $37 million (annualized 0.25 percent of average loans). Regions' third quarter 2006 provision for loan losses was $25 million and the loan loss allowance was $778 million at both June 30 and Sept. 30, 2006. The allowance-to-loans ratio was 1.31 percent compared to mid-year's 1.32 percent. Non-performing assets dropped $8 million linked quarter, or to $312 million at Sept. 30, 2006--0.52 percent of loans and foreclosed real estate. By comparison, non-performing assets were $441 million (0.75 percent of loans and foreclosed real estate) at Sept. 30, 2005. Loans greater than 90 days past due were steady linked quarter at $79 million. SHARE BUYBACKS REMAIN PART OF ACTIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY During the third quarter, Regions repurchased 1.4 million common shares at an average cost of $35.46 per share. Year-to-date Sept. 30, buybacks totaled 8.7 million shares, leaving an additional 18.9 million shares that can be repurchased under the company's current authorization. At Sept. 30, 2006, Regions maintained a strong capital position, or tangible shareholders' equity-to-tangible assets of 7.08 percent. This compared to 6.69 percent at mid-2006. MERGER WITH AMSOUTH EXPECTED TO CLOSE FOURTH QUARTER 2006 On Oct. 3, 2006, AmSouth and Regions shareholders voted to approve the merger of the two companies, meaning the transaction is likely to be completed in the fourth quarter pending regulatory approvals. Upon completion of the merger, AmSouth shareholders will receive 0.7974 Regions shares for each AmSouth share. The combined company will retain the name Regions Financial Corporation. The merger planning process is proceeding on schedule. Over 600 senior leadership positions have been announced and preliminary integration timelines have been laid out.

Construction loan balances related to various types of properties grew including single family residential, multi-family residential, retail developments and commercial use facilities. - - Average community banking loans increased 5.9%, linked-quarter, annualized, primarily due to an increase in commercial and construction loans, offset partially by a decline in consumer lines of credit. - - In the above tables, commercial loans and other real estate loans are impacted by ongoing reclassification of new and renewed loans by purpose as opposed to collateral.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 9 DEPOSITS DEPOSIT PORTFOLIO - PERIOD END DATA AVERAGE COMMUNITY BANKING AND WHOLESALE DEPOSITS * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - The linked-quarter decline in interest-free deposits, interest-bearing checking deposits and savings was primarily due to the combination of a decline in deposits in areas impacted by Hurricane Katrina and customer preference for longer term, higher rate deposit products. - - Regions introduced a money market promotion in mid-June designed to attract rate sensitive customers to a lower cost transaction account. Correspondingly, money market deposits increased and the recent momentum in CD accounts slowed. In addition, as customer preferences for higher rate products increased, some monies shifted from interest-free and interest-bearing checking into these accounts. - - Regions continues to open net new accounts. The DDA open/close ratio remains positive at 1.10 for 3Q06; however, it has declined slightly from 2Q06 levels (1.24) given net outflows in Katrina-impacted areas and customer preferences for longer term, higher rate deposit products. - - Average community banking deposits declined 3.7%, linked-quarter, annualized, primarily as a result of decreases in levels of interest-free, savings and interest-bearing checking deposits, partially offset by an increase in money market deposits. - - The increase in CD's > $100K and average wholesale deposits is a result of increased use of money desk CD's as a funding source.
FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 10 OPERATING PERFORMANCE REVENUE * Linked quarter percentage changes are presented on an annualized basis. - - Net interest margin was 4.21% in 3Q06, a decrease of 3 bps linked-quarter, from 4.24% in 2Q06 and an increase of 28 bps compared to 3Q05. - - Linked-quarter decline in non-interest income is primarily due to a decline in mortgage and brokerage revenues. - - Regions is positioned slightly asset-sensitive at September 30, 2006.

The favorable effect of the insurance recoveries was offset by higher utilities and building insurance expenses linked-quarter. - - Regions sold $310 million dollars of securities during the quarter at an $8.1 million gain. - - Excluding MSR impairment/recapture, total non-interest expense declined $30 million or 16% linked-quarter, annualized.

FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 13 MORGAN KEEGAN (CONT.) - - 20,000 new accounts were opened in 3Q06 compared to 22,200 in 2Q06 and 21,300 in 3Q05. - - Total customer assets were $65.9 billion at September 30, 2006, compared to $62.5 billion at June 30, 2006 and $54.4 billion at September 30, 2005.

FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD QUARTER 2006 EARNINGS RELEASE PAGE 15 CREDIT QUALITY CREDIT QUALITY - - Net charge-offs totaled $24 million, or an annualized 0.16 percent of average loans, and included approximately $1.4 million of net charge-offs from the Katrina-related portfolio. - - The provision for loan losses was $25 million in 3Q06. - - Regions' September 30, 2006, allowance for loan losses includes approximately $55 million of reserves identified for the Katrina portfolio; approximately $7 million in cumulative Katrina portfolio net charge-offs have been recognized through September 30, 2006. - - Non-performing assets decreased to 0.52% of loans and other real estate at September 30, 2006 from 0.54% at June 30, 2006. - - Regions' non-performing loan portfolio is composed primarily of small to medium-sized loans that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. - - Management considers the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses from loans in the portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgments and estimates that may change in the future. Unfavorable changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the reserve, or the availability of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods.
