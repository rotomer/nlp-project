ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A DEFINITIVE MATERIAL AGREEMENT Revisions to performance restricted stock awards. - ------------------------------------------------- On October 18, 2006, the compensation committee adopted revisions to Regions Financial Corporation's 2005 performance restricted stock awards, contingent upon completion of the merger of Regions and AmSouth Bancorporation. The committee considered the effect of the merger on the original performance goals and revised the performance goals to preserve the benefit of the awards in a manner equitable to the recipients. The awards, which were granted to approximately 150 Regions executives and key employees, provide for the granting of restricted stock in 2007 and 2008 based on Regions' achievement of company-wide performance goals related to earnings per share for 2006 and earnings per share growth relative to peers in 2007. As the awards were originally structured, the restricted stock was to have been granted if Regions attained the performance goals. The restricted stock grant would have varied from 0% to 75% of the maximum award depending on the level of 2006 goal attainment, and for the second year from 0% to 100% of the balance depending on the level of 2007 goal attainment. When issued, the restricted stock will vest ratably at the end of each year in a three year period. The compensation committee determined that Regions' merger with AmSouth will affect the measurement of the performance goals in the last fiscal quarter of 2006 and in 2007, compared to the committee's original intent. The committee also determined that for the first three quarters of 2006, the Company's earnings per share have substantially exceeded the maximum level of the 2006 performance goals on a pro rata basis. Based on these determinations, the committee eliminated the second year contingency and the 2007 performance goals, reaffirmed the 2006 performance goals, and increased the first year award maximum level to 100%, such that the award levels are threshold - 25%, target - 50%, and maximum - 100%. As a result, but contingent upon the completion of the Regions-AmSouth merger, the performance restricted stock will be issued in 2007 to those award recipients who remain employed through the date of issuance, based on the level of attainment of the 2006 performance goals. The executive officers of Regions potentially affected by this revision include Jackson W. Moore, D. Bryan Jordan, Samuel E. Upchurch, Jr., Andrew W. Stein, John I. Fleischauer, Jr., Peter D. Miller, Steven J. Schenck, John V. White, G. Douglas Edwards, David C. Gordon, William E. Askew, Doyle R. Rippee, H. Lynn Harton, Robert A. Goethe , and Steve R. Vinson.
