Earnings Highlights
(in millions except per share data)
 
 
 
Important Note
: Regions' fourth quarter 2006 financial data includes three months of operating results for legacy Regions while legacy AmSouth results are only included since the Nov. 4, 2006 merger date. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, prior period financial information does not include AmSouth.
Strong core results and merger integration progressing as planned
"Our first quarter earnings demonstrate strong core results," said Dowd Ritter, president and chief executive officer. "This quarter was also marked by progress in our merger integration, including successful systems conversions and completion of required branch divestitures. In addition, we completed the sale of EquiFirst, our non-conforming mortgage origination business. This strong start to 2007 is tangible evidence that the many anticipated benefits of the merger are beginning to be realized."
During the first quarter, Regions began implementing its integration plans, successfully completing the conversion of its brokerage operations system and its mortgage servicing platform. As we enter the second quarter, conversion of payroll and employee benefit systems is also well underway. Additionally, four carefully planned branch conversion events are on track to begin in July.
On March 30, 2007, Regions completed the sale of its non-conforming wholesale mortgage originator, EquiFirst Holdings Corp., to Barclays Bank PLC. Thus, EquiFirst's first quarter results were reported as discontinued operations, and prior periods were reclassified accordingly. EquiFirst sustained a first quarter after tax net loss of $141.1 million (19 cents per diluted share). The closing of the EquiFirst transaction essentially ends Regions' direct exposure to a business that had become increasingly difficult and was outside the company's strategic focus.
First quarter EPS rises 6 percent versus the corresponding prior year period, excluding merger-related charges and discontinued operations
Regions' first quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was $474.1 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, which included $30.4 million in after-tax merger-related expenses (4 cents per diluted share). Excluding the impact of merger-related expenses, per diluted share earnings from continuing operations were 69 cents, or 6 percent above 2006 first quarter's 65 cents and 12 percent higher, on a linked-quarter annualized basis, than the 67 cents reported in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Banking business generates solid net interest income growth
A strong and relatively stable net interest margin drove solid performance in Regions' banking franchise during the quarter. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.2 billion, benefiting from a healthy net interest margin. First quarter's margin was 3.99 percent, compared with 4.10 percent in the fourth quarter, and reflects the combination of AmSouth's balance sheet and its lower net interest margin with Regions' for the first full quarter since the Nov. 4 merger date. Approximately 7 basis points of the linked-quarter margin decline was due to a lower tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income from the first quarter adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) relating to accounting for uncertain tax positions.
Low-cost deposits increased versus the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of divestitures, largely resulting from a successful free interest-bearing checking campaign and higher money market balances. This result, coupled with a slowdown in the growth of higher cost certificates of deposit, had a positive impact to the Company's overall deposit mix. Loan growth remained challenging in the current environment. While real estate construction lending increased, net decreases in other categories, led by a decline in real estate mortgage loans, more than offset portfolio growth. Required branch divestitures reduced March 31, 2007, deposits and loans held-for-sale balances by a respective $2.8 billion and $1.6 billion compared to year-end 2006.
Fee-based revenues increase
Deposit service charges and brokerage income remained key drivers of non-interest revenue from continuing operations, which totaled $696.9 million in the first quarter.
Morgan Keegan's momentum continued during the quarter, earning $45.5 million on revenue of $302.0 million. Results were driven by the private client retail brokerage division and trust division which both increased revenue during the quarter due to strong sales levels. Offsetting this success somewhat was a seasonal slowdown in equity capital markets activities.
Regions Mortgage's revenues declined $7.1 million as a result of lower secondary marketing gains, reflecting the challenging operating environment for the mortgage industry as a whole.
Operating expenses well-controlled / Cost saves remain on track
In spite of seasonal increases and inclusion of legacy AmSouth for a full three months versus two months in the prior period, first quarter non-interest expenses, excluding merger costs and discontinued operations, were well controlled and resulted in improved efficiency. A contributing factor was the realization of $50.8 million in pre-tax merger-related cost savings in the first quarter. The Company remains on track to reach an estimated $150 million in pre-tax net cost saves for full-year 2007.
Credit losses remain low
Net loan charge-offs declined to $46.0 million, or an annualized 0.20 percent of average net loans in first quarter 2007 compared to $56.1 million or an annualized 0.27 percent of average loans in fourth quarter 2006. Net loan charge-offs in the previous quarter included $11.0 million related to conforming certain credit policies between Regions and AmSouth.
The first quarter's provision for loan losses totaled $47.0 million. The total reserve for credit losses was 1.18 percent of net loans at March 31, 2007, up one basis point from the previous quarter. Total non-performing assets at March 31, 2007, were $422.5 million, or 0.45 percent of loans and other
real estate, compared to $379.1 million, or 0.40 percent at Dec. 31, 2006. The increase in non-performing assets is primarily attributable to real estate loans for which Regions believes it is adequately reserved.
Share buybacks continue
During the first quarter, Regions repurchased 10.0 million of its common shares at an average cost of $36.09 per share. This leaves 53.9 million shares remaining under current authorizations.
At March 31, 2007, Regions' capital position, as measured by the tangible shareholders' equity-to-tangible assets ratio, was 6.52 percent. This compared to 6.53 percent at Dec. 31, 2006. Due to the first quarter adoption of FIN 48, Regions adjusted equity lower by a cumulative $259 million. This adjustment does not materially affect our capital adequacy. Additionally, the adoption of FIN 48 creates an ongoing approximate 200 basis point increase in Regions' effective tax rate.

Forward looking statements
This press release includes forward-looking statements about Regions Financial Corporation within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "project," and similar expressions often signify forward-looking statements. Such statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Regions cautions that actual results and events could differ materially from expectations expressed in forward-looking statements as a result of factors such as possible changes in economic and business conditions and interest rates; Regions' ability to integrate the recent combination with AmSouth Bancorporation and to retain and attract customers; the effects of geopolitical instability and risks such as terrorist attacks; the effects of weather and natural disasters such as hurricanes; possible changes in laws and regulations and governmental monetary and fiscal policies; the cost and other effects of legal and administrative cases and similar contingencies; possible changes in the credit worthiness of customers and the possible impairment of collectibility of loans, increased competition from both banks and non-banks, and effects of critical accounting policies and judgments. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please look under the caption "Forward Looking Statements" in
Regions' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, as on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures
Page one of this earnings release presents a computation of earnings and earnings per diluted share excluding discontinued operations and merger charges (non-GAAP). Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Merger charges are included in financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Regions believes the exclusion of merger charges in expressing earnings and certain other financial measures provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons. See page 15 of the supplement to this earnings release for additional computations of earnings and certain other financial measures excluding discontinued operations and merger charges and corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures for the periods presented.

Discontinued Operations - EquiFirst
Q. What caused the decline in estimated purchase price from $225 million to $76 million?
A. The final purchase price of $76 million was based on the closing book value of assets and liabilities. The value of these assets and liabilities declined due to operating losses during the quarter.
Q. Where is this decline in purchase price reflected in the financial statements?
A. The decline in purchase price is reflected in the loss on discontinued operations and in a corresponding reduction of stockholders' equity. See page 3 of this document for the income statement impact.
Q. Was there a gain or loss on the transaction?
A. There was a slight gain of approximately $1 million after tax recognized on the transaction. It is included in discontinued operations.
Q. Will there be any additional adjustments to the purchase price after close?
A. There will be a final settlement of the net book value which will be completed during the second quarter. Any adjustments are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Q. Does Regions have any exposure to EquiFirst loans on its balance sheet?
A. Regions has a small amount of EquiFirst paper in its loan portfolio (less than $100 million).
Q. Does Regions have any additional exposure (i.e., recourse on early payment default, etc.) to this business?
A. Regions does not anticipate any material impact on its financial statements from ongoing exposure.
