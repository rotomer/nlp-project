("Morgan Keegan") and each of the other Underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), for whom Merrill Lynch and Morgan Keegan are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective principal amounts of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2009 (the "2009 Notes") and Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2012 (the "2012 Notes" and, together with the 2009 Notes, the "Securities") set forth in said Schedule A opposite the name of such Underwriter.
     The Securities will be issued in book-entry form to Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), pursuant to a letter agreement, to be dated as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2(b) hereof) (the "DTC Agreement"), between the Company and DTC.
     The Securities are to be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), and the Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of June 26, 2007 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the First Supplemental Indenture and the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), in each case, between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"). Regions Bank, a banking corporation chartered under the laws of Alabama and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Interest Calculation Agent"), will act as calculation agent with respect to the Securities pursuant to an Interest Calculation Agreement, to be dated as of June 26, 2007, between the Company and the Interest Calculation Agent (the "Interest Calculation Agreement").
 
The Indenture, the Interest Calculation Agreement, the DTC Agreement and this Agreement are collectively referred to as the "Operative Agreements."
     The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representatives deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.
     The Company and certain trusts sponsored by the Company have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a joint automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-142839), and a post-effective amendment thereto, including the related prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "1933 Act Regulations") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Such registration statement covers the registration of the Securities and certain other securities described therein under the 1933 Act. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B ("Rule 430B") of the 1933 Act Regulations and paragraph (b) of Rule 424 ("Rule 424(b)") of the 1933 Act Regulations. Any information included in such prospectus that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information." Each prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein called a "preliminary prospectus." Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto to such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by 1933 Act Regulations, is herein called the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement." The final prospectus in the form first furnished to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement, is herein called the "Prospectus." For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
     All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

Actions against Parties; Notification
provided
however
     (d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
     SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
 
     The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
     SECTION 8. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its respective officers or trustees and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

     (b) .

     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.

[THE FOLLOWING LEGEND SHALL APPEAR ON THE FACE OF EACH GLOBAL SECURITY:
     THIS NOTE IS A SECURITY IN GLOBAL FORM ("GLOBAL SECURITY") WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 203 OF THE BASE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION (THE "DEPOSITORY") OR A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY, WHICH MAY BE TREATED BY THE COMPANY, THE TRUSTEE AND ANY AGENT THEREOF AS OWNER AND HOLDER OF THIS NOTE FOR ALL PURPOSES.
     UNLESS THIS NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TO REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY NOTE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
     UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR NOTES IN DEFINITIVE REGISTERED FORM IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES REFERRED TO IN THE BASE INDENTURE, THIS GLOBAL SECURITY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TO THE DEPOSITORY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY OR BY THE DEPOSITORY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITORY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITORY.]
 
     REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., the principal sum of two-hundred fifty million United States Dollars (U.S.$250,000,000) on June 26, 2009 (the "Maturity Date") and to pay interest thereon, from and including June 26, 2007 (the "Original Issue Date") to but excluding September 26, 2007 at the Initial Interest Rate (as defined below) and from and including September 26, 2007 to but excluding the Maturity Date, quarterly in arrears on March 26, June 26, September 26, and December 26 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), beginning on September 26, 2007, at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR (as defined below) plus 0.03% until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The initial interest rate shall be equal to LIBOR plus 0.03% per annum (the "Initial Interest Rate") as determined by Regions Bank, as calculation agent for this Note (the "Calculation Agent"), as described below.
     The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date (each such date, a "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date and shall otherwise be payable, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Interest on this Note at maturity shall be payable to the persons to whom principal is payable. "Business Day" shall mean any day, other than Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and is also a London Banking Day. "London Banking Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
     Interest shall be computed based on an actual/360 day count basis (as described below). Interest payments on this Note shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the Original Issue Date or the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
 
     If any Interest Payment Date, other than the Maturity Date, falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except if that Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the day such payment was due, and no interest on this Note shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date.
     The rate of interest on this Note shall be reset quarterly (the "Interest Reset Period," and the first day of each Interest Reset Period shall be an "Interest Reset Date"). The Interest Reset Dates for this Note shall be March 26, June 26, September 26 and December 26 of each year, beginning on September 26, 2007; provided that the interest rate in effect from and including the Original Issue Date to but excluding the first Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate. If any Interest Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
     The Company has appointed Regions Bank, an Alabama-chartered banking corporation, as the Calculation Agent for this Note. As used in this Note, the term "Calculation Agent" includes any successor calculation agent duly appointed by the Company. Upon the request of the Holder of this Note, the Calculation Agent shall provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that shall become effective on the next Interest Reset Date. The determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be final and binding absent manifest error.
     The Calculation Agent shall determine the Initial Interest Rate by reference to LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the Original Issue Date and the interest rates for each succeeding Interest Reset Period by reference to LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date, each of which is referred to herein as an "Interest Determination Date."
     LIBOR with respect to an Interest Determination Date shall be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in United States dollars for a three-month period that appears on Reuters on page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service (or any successor service) for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date. If Reuters Page LIBOR01 does not include this rate or is unavailable on the Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the London interbank market (which may include affiliates of the underwriters of this Note (other than Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.)), as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide that bank's offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date to prime
 
banks in the London interbank market for deposits in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in United States dollars for a three-month period beginning on the second London Banking Day after the Interest Determination Date. If at least two offered quotations are so provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in The City of New York (which may include affiliates of the underwriters of this Note (other than Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.)), as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide that bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date for loans in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in United States dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the second London Banking Day after the Interest Determination Date. If at least two rates are so provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those rates. If fewer than two rates are so provided, then LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
     Accrued interest on this Note shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360. The interest rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date shall be the applicable rate as reset on that date. The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate. All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on this Note shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with .000005% rounded up to ..00001%), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from these calculations shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent rounded upward).
     Payments of principal shall be made upon the surrender of this Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by the Company for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or in the City of Birmingham, Alabama in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, by Dollar check drawn on, or transfer to, a Dollar account. Payments of interest on this Note may be made by Dollar check, drawn on a Dollar account, mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, or, upon written application by the Holder to the Security Registrar setting forth wire instructions not later than the relevant Record Date, by wire transfer to a Dollar account.
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof or an Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of one of their respective authorized signatories, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly executed and delivered under its corporate seal.
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company designated as its "Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2009" (herein called the "Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to U.S.$250,000,000, issued under an Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005, (herein called the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Base Indenture), and a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2007, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Second Supplemental Indenture;" the Base Indenture, as modified and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Trustee upon such surrender by the Holder shall issue the new Notes in the requested denominations.
     No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder prior to the Stated Maturity of the Notes.
     The Notes are unsecured and rank equally among themselves and with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
     The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, increase the principal amount of the Notes by issuing additional Notes in the future on the same terms and conditions, except for any differences in the issue price and interest accrued prior to the date of issuance of the additional Notes and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes. The Notes and any additional Notes shall rank equally and ratably and shall be treated as a single series for all purposes under the Indenture.
     The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $5,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default under Section 501(4) of the Indenture relating to a breach of the covenant contained in clause (x) of the second paragraph of Section 1009 of the Indenture) shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes, together with accrued interest to the date of declaration, may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee thereunder and offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request and the Trustee for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by any Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or interest on this Note or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or the City of Birmingham, Alabama (which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee), or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees by the Security Registrar. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of
 
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to recover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture, in this Note or because of any indebtedness evidenced hereby, shall be had against any promoter, as such, or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance by the Holders hereof and as part of consideration for the issue hereof.
     THE INDENTURE AND THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
     All capitalized terms used in this Note but not defined herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

     Interest shall be computed based on an actual/360 day count basis (as described below). Interest payments on this Note shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the Original Issue Date or the most recent Interest Payment Date on which
 
interest has been paid to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
     If any Interest Payment Date, other than the Maturity Date, falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except if that Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the day such payment was due, and no interest on this Note shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date.
     The rate of interest on this Note shall be reset quarterly (the "Interest Reset Period," and the first day of each Interest Reset Period shall be an "Interest Reset Date"). The Interest Reset Dates for this Note shall be March 26, June 26, September 26 and December 26 of each year, beginning on September 26, 2007; provided that the interest rate in effect from and including the Original Issue Date to but excluding the first Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate. If any Interest Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
     The Company has appointed Regions Bank, an Alabama-chartered banking corporation, as the Calculation Agent for this Note. As used in this Note, the term "Calculation Agent" includes any successor calculation agent duly appointed by the Company. Upon the request of the Holder of this Note, the Calculation Agent shall provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that shall become effective on the next Interest Reset Date. The determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be final and binding absent manifest error.
     The Calculation Agent shall determine the Initial Interest Rate by reference to LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the Original Issue Date and the interest rates for each succeeding Interest Reset Period by reference to LIBOR on the second London Banking Day preceding the applicable Interest Reset Date, each of which is referred to herein as an "Interest Determination Date."
     (i) LIBOR with respect to an Interest Determination Date shall be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in United States dollars for a three-month period that appears on Reuters on page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service (or any successor service) for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars) ("Reuters Page LIBOR01") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date. If Reuters Page LIBOR01 does not include this rate or is unavailable on the Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the London interbank market (which may include affiliates of the underwriters of this Note (other than Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.)), as selected
 
by the Calculation Agent, to provide that bank's offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market for deposits in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in United States dollars for a three-month period beginning on the second London Banking Day after the Interest Determination Date. If at least two offered quotations are so provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in The City of New York (which may include affiliates of the underwriters of this Note (other than Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.)), as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide that bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date for loans in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in United States dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the second London Banking Day after the Interest Determination Date. If at least two rates are so provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those rates. If fewer than two rates are so provided, then LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
     Accrued interest on this Note shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Note by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which interest is being paid. The interest factor for each day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360. The interest rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date shall be the applicable rate as reset on that date. The interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date, or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate. All percentages used in or resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest on this Note shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with .000005% rounded up to ..00001%), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from these calculations shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent rounded upward).
     Payments of principal shall be made upon the surrender of this Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by the Company for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or in the City of Birmingham, Alabama in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, by Dollar check drawn on, or transfer to, a Dollar account. Payments of interest on this Note may be made by Dollar check, drawn on a Dollar account, mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, or, upon written application by the Holder to the Security Registrar setting forth wire instructions not later than the relevant Record Date, by wire transfer to a Dollar account.
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof or an Authenticating Agent by the manual signature of one of their respective authorized signatories, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly executed and delivered under its corporate seal.
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company designated as its "Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2012" (herein called the "Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to U.S.$350,000,000, issued under an Indenture, dated as of August 8, 2005, (herein called the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Base Indenture), and a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2007, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Second Supplemental Indenture;" the Base Indenture, as modified and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Trustee upon such surrender by the Holder shall issue the new Notes in the requested denominations.
     No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder prior to the Stated Maturity of the Notes.
     The Notes are unsecured and rank equally among themselves and with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
     The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, increase the principal amount of the Notes by issuing additional Notes in the future on the same terms and conditions, except for any differences in the issue price and interest accrued prior to the date of issuance of the additional Notes and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes. The Notes and any additional Notes shall rank equally and ratably and shall be treated as a single series for all purposes under the Indenture.
     The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $5,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
     If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default under Section 501(4) of the Indenture relating to a breach of the covenant contained in clause (x) of the second paragraph of Section 1009 of the Indenture) shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes, together with accrued interest to the date of declaration, may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee thereunder and offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request and the Trustee for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes that are Outstanding. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by any Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal of or interest on this Note or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or the City of Birmingham, Alabama (which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee), or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees by the Security Registrar. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of
 
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to recover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture, in this Note or because of any indebtedness evidenced hereby, shall be had against any promoter, as such, or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance by the Holders hereof and as part of consideration for the issue hereof.
