loss, claim, damage, liability, action, litigation, investigation or proceeding whatsoever (whether or not such Underwriter Indemnified Party is a party thereto), whether threatened or commenced, based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Final Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the 5

paragraphs concerning short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales by the Underwriters.
(c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Guarantor or the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
Contribution
 
opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Trust Preferred Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(d).
9. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase the Trust Preferred Securities hereunder on a Closing Date and the aggregate principal amount of the Trust Preferred Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Trust Preferred Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Guarantor for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Trust Preferred Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Trust Preferred Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Trust Preferred Securities that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Guarantor for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor, except as provided in Section 10. As used in this Agreement, the term "" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

If the purchase of the Trust Preferred Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities, and the respective obligations of the Guarantor and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall remain in effect. In addition, if any Trust Preferred Securities have been purchased hereunder, the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of  -   - % Trust Preferred Securities, liquidation amount $25 per security (the "Securities"), of Regions Financing Trust III, a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), and the related guarantee thereof by Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), which is the depositor of the Trust and the guarantor under the Guarantee Agreement referred to below.
The Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the Company's 8.875% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2078 (the "JSNs") (File No. 333-142839) (the "Registration Statement") was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, documents incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated May 11, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated April 25, 2008 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated April 23, 2008 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), the Final Term Sheet, dated April 25, 2008 (the "Final Term Sheet") and filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act (such Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and Final Term Sheet, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and the Prospectus Supplement and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Trust and the Company and the Company's accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and the Trust and the Company's accountants concerning certain matters relating to the Company and the Trust and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company and the administrative trustees of the Trust, an opinion addressed to you from the Trust's counsel and a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and insofar as it relates to the offering of the Securities, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 3:20 p.m. on April 25, 2008 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this paragraph has caused us to believe that the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement except for those made under the captions "The Trust," "Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes," "Description of the Trust Preferred Securities," "Description of the Guarantee of the Trust Preferred Securities," "Relationship Among Trust Preferred Securities, Junior Subordinated Notes and Guarantee," "Replacement Capital Covenant," and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement insofar as they relate to provisions of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement, the Replacement Capital Covenant and the Underwriting Agreement therein described and under the captions "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "ERISA Considerations," insofar as they relate to provisions of the United States federal tax law and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the auditor's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the statements of the eligibility of the respective Trustees under the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Indenture and the Guarantee Agreement under which the Securities and the JSNs are being issued.
This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the several Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities or the JSNs and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities or the JSNs.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement, dated April 25, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among Regions Financing Trust III, a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as depositor of the Trust and as guarantor under the Guarantee Agreement referred to below, and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of  -  of the Trust's  - % Trust Preferred Securities, liquidation amount $25 per security (the "Securities"), issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of April 30, 2008 (the "Trust Agreement"), of the Trust, we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that:
1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2. Each of (i) the Trust Agreement, (ii) the Guarantee Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2008 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as guarantee trustee, and (iii) the Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 15, 2002, between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 30, 2008, between the Company and the Indenture Trustee (together, the "Indenture"), has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
3. The Company's 8.875% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2078 (the "JSNs") have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Guarantee Agreement, the Indenture and the JSNs constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
4. All regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for (i) the issuance, sale and delivery of the Securities by the Trust to the Underwriters and (ii) the issuance, sale and delivery of the JSNs by the Company to the Trust have been obtained or made.
5. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
6. Neither the Company nor the Trust is or, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the JSNs and the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus Supplement, dated April 25, 2008, relating to the JSNs and the Securities, would not be on the date hereof an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
As contemplated by the qualifications set forth in paragraph (3) above, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
We have also relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that each of the Trust Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each party thereto other than the Company, that the JSNs conform to the specimen thereof examined by us, that the Indenture Trustee's certificate of authentication of the JSNs has been manually signed by one of the Indenture Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Assistant General Counsel of Regions Financial Corporation (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, and as such, have served as counsel for the Company and Regions Financing Trust III, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), in connection with the issuance and sale of the Trust's  - % Trust Preferred Securities (the "Issuance"). This opinion is rendered pursuant to that certain Underwriting Agreement dated April 25, 2008 by and among the Company, the Trust and you (the "Agreement"), as representative of the Underwriters named on Schedule A thereto. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Agreement.
For the purposes of this opinion, I am familiar with and have examined the Agreement, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company and such corporate records and other documents and have made such examinations of law as I have deemed relevant. As to factual matters, I have relied upon statements, certificates and other assurances of public officials and of officers and other representatives of the Company, and upon such other certificates as I deemed appropriate, which factual matters have not been independently established or verified by me. I have also assumed, among other things, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the accuracy of representations contained in reviewed documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copied documents.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications herein set forth, I am of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The qualification of any opinion or statement herein by the use of the words "to the best of my knowledge" or "known to me" means that, during the course of my employment in connection with the affairs of the Company and with respect to the Issuance, no information has come to my attention that gives me actual knowledge of the existence or absence of the matters, actions, proceedings, orders, items, indentures, agreements, documents or facts so qualified. However, I have not undertaken any independent investigation or inquiry to determine the existence of such matters, actions, proceedings, orders, items, indentures, agreements, documents or facts, other than such investigation or inquiry of the other attorneys in the legal department of the Company that I have deemed necessary or appropriate to render the forgoing opinions, and no inference as to my knowledge thereof shall be drawn from the fact of my employment by any entity. As used in this paragraph, the term "actual knowledge" means conscious awareness.
I am licensed to practice law only in the State of Alabama, and accordingly, I offer no opinion as to the application of decisions or statutory law (including conflict of law rules) of any jurisdiction other than the States of Alabama and Delaware and the United States of America.
In rendering the foregoing opinions, I have relied in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company or its Significant Subsidiaries, with respect to which I believe that both the Company and the Underwriters are justified in relying upon such certificates.
This opinion is intended solely for your use as Underwriters. As such, it may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose than for the legal conclusions expressed herein.
(i) The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing and in good standing under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and all filings required under the laws of the State of Delaware with respect to the creation and valid existence of the Trust as a statutory trust have been made;
(ii) Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Declaration of Trust, the Trust has the trust power and authority to own its property and conduct its business, all as described in the General Disclosure Package;

(iv) Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Declaration of Trust, the Trust has the trust power and authority to (x) execute and deliver this Agreement and the Expense Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Expense Agreement, and (y) issue and perform its obligations under the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities;

(vi) Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the form of certificate attached to the Declaration of Trust to represent the Trust Preferred Securities is an appropriate form of certificate to evidence ownership of the Trust Preferred Securities. The Trust Preferred Securities have been duly authorized by the Declaration of Trust and, when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters, in accordance with this Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable beneficial interests in the Trust. The holders of the Trust Preferred Securities are entitled to the benefits provided by the Declaration of Trust (subject to the terms of the Declaration of Trust); and the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, provided that such counsel may note that the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities and of the Trust Common Securities may be obligated, pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, to (a) provide indemnity and/or security in connection with, and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from, transfers or exchanges of Trust Preferred Security certificates and the issuance of replacement of Trust Preferred Security certificates, and (b) provide security and indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Property Trustee (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) to exercise its rights and remedies under the Declaration of Trust;
(vii) The Trust Common Securities have been duly authorized by the Declaration of Trust and when issued and delivered by the Trust to the Guarantor against payment therefor described in the Declaration of Trust, will be validly issued and fully paid (subject to the qualifications described in the proviso to clause (vi) next above) beneficial interests in the Trust. The Guarantor, as holder of the Trust Common Securities, will be entitled to the benefits of the Declaration of Trust;
(viii) Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Declaration of Trust, the issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities is not subject to preemptive rights;
(ix) The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of this Agreement and the Expense Agreement, the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by the Trust with its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not violate (A) any of the provisions of the Certificate of Trust of the Trust or the Declaration of Trust, or (B) any applicable Delaware law or administrative regulation;
(x) No authorization, approval, consent or order of any Delaware court or Delaware governmental authority or Delaware agency is required to be obtained by the Trust solely in connection with the issuance and sale of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities or the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of this Agreement or the Expense Agreement. In rendering the opinion expressed in this paragraph (x), such counsel need express no opinion concerning the securities laws of the State of Delaware; and
(xi) Assuming that the Trust derives no income from or connected with services provided within the State of Delaware and has no assets, activities (other than maintaining the Delaware Trustee and the filing of documents with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware) or employees in the State of Delaware and assuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust or as an association not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the holders of Trust Preferred Securities (other than those holders who reside or are domiciled in the State of Delaware) will have no liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware solely as a result of their participation in the Trust, and the Trust will not be liable for any income tax imposed by the State of Delaware.
