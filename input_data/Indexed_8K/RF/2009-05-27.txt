On May 27, 2009, Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions") issued 250,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below). Under the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Regions' ability to declare or pay dividends or make distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of its common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event that Regions does not pay in full or declare and set aside for payment in full dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are more fully set forth in the Certificate of Designations described in Item 5.03 below and filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the form of certificate for the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On May 26, 2009, Regions filed a Certificate of Designations (the "Certificate of Designations") with the Secretary of State of Delaware to establish the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The Certificate of Designations became effective upon filing, and a copy is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On May 27, 2009, Regions issued and sold 460 million shares (which includes 60 million optional shares purchased by the underwriters) of its common stock at a price to the public of $4 per share and 250,000 shares of its 10% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B ("Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock"), at a price to the public of 100% of the initial liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, pursuant to its previously announced offering of these securities. The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15 percent of the offered amount of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock from Regions. The sales were made pursuant to Underwriting Agreements, each dated May 20, 2009, between Regions and the underwriters. The shares of common stock and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-142839).
The offerings will generate gross proceeds of approximately $2.09 billion, without giving effect to the exercise of the underwriters' options to purchase additional shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.
The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will pay, when declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative dividends at a rate of 10% per annum on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, payable quarterly in arrears. The first dividend payment date will be August 15, 2009.
If not earlier converted, each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on December 15, 2010 (the "Mandatory Conversion Date") into between approximately 227.2727 shares and 250.0000 shares of Regions common stock. At any time prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, holders may elect to convert their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at the minimum conversion rate of 227.2727 shares of common stock for each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. In such a conversion, or upon a conversion on the Mandatory Conversion Date, Regions will have the right to pay any dividends payable at the time of such conversion in cash, shares of Regions' common stock or a combination thereof. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is also convertible by holders in the event of certain fundamental change transactions or at the election of Regions, in either case at a higher conversion rate with any dividends payable at the time of conversion to be paid in shares of Regions common stock as described in the Certificate of Designations incorporated by reference herein. The applicable conversion rate will be subject to anti-dilution adjustments in certain circumstances.
The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will generally have no voting rights, except as required by law or in the Certificate of Designations. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will rank with respect to dividend rights and rights upon Regions' liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:

to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act, to notify you and upon your request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as you may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any of the Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon your request but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as you may request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act;

The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder, as to the Securities to be delivered at each Time of Delivery, shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of such Time of Delivery (it being understood, however, that in the case of the Second Time of Delivery the representations and warranties in Sections 1(l) and 1(q) shall be limited to the Optional Securities), true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

(k) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to you that the representations and warranties of the Company are true and correct on and as of such date; the performance by the Company in all material respects of all its obligations required to be performed at or prior to such time; and as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (g) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) or any Pricing Disclosure Package under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any Pricing Disclosure Package in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Pricing Disclosure Package arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any Pricing Disclosure Package
 
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one
 
hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other
 
documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified
 
party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be
 
entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above to
 
require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If for any reason any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein other than because of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities, except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
14. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of the controlling persons referred to in Section 9(e) hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Trust Preferred Securities. The provisions of Section 7 and Section 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter
 
has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
17. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, executors, and administrators, and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
18.
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

If any Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, the dividend payable on such date shall be paid on the next Business Day without adjustment. Accumulations of dividends on shares of Series B shall not bear interest. Dividends payable for any period other than a full Dividend Period (based on the number of days elapsed during the period) shall be computed on the basis of days elapsed over a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
(b) No dividend shall be declared or paid upon, or any sum set apart for the payment of dividends upon, any outstanding share of the Series B with respect to any Dividend Period unless all dividends for all preceding Dividend Periods shall have been declared and paid or declared and a sufficient sum or number of shares of Common Stock shall have been set apart for the payment of such dividends, upon all outstanding shares of Series B.
(c) Holders of shares of Series B shall not be entitled to any dividends on the Series B, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends.

The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) redemptions, purchases
 
or other acquisitions of shares of Common Stock or other Junior Stock in connection with the administration of any employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business (including purchases to offset the Share Dilution Amount (as defined below) pursuant to a publicly announced repurchase plan) and consistent with past practice, that any purchases to offset the Share Dilution Amount shall in no event exceed the Share Dilution Amount; (ii) purchases or other acquisitions by any broker-dealer subsidiary of the Corporation solely for the purpose of market-making, stabilization or customer facilitation transactions in Junior Stock or Parity Stock in the ordinary course of its business; (iii) purchases by any broker-dealer subsidiary of the Corporation of capital stock of the Corporation for resale pursuant to an offering by the Corporation of such capital stock underwritten by such broker-dealer subsidiary; (iv) any dividends or distributions of rights or Junior Stock in connection with a shareholders' rights plan or any redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant to any shareholders' rights plan; (v) the acquisition by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of record ownership in Junior Stock or Parity Stock for the beneficial ownership of any other persons (other than for the beneficial ownership by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries), including as trustees or custodians; and (vi) the exchange or conversion of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock or of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock (with the same or lesser aggregate liquidation amount) or Junior Stock, in each case, solely to the extent required pursuant to binding contractual agreements entered into prior to the Issue Date or any subsequent agreement for the accelerated exercise, settlement or exchange thereof for Common Stock.
provided
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside for the benefit of the Holders thereof on the applicable Record Date) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a Dividend Period related to such Dividend Payment Date) in full upon Series B and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on Series B and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the Dividend Period related to such Dividend Payment Date) shall be declared so that the respective amounts of such dividends declared shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of Series B and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (including, if applicable, dividends on such amount) (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the Dividend Period related to such Dividend Payment Date) (subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds and including, in the case of Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear to each other.

(c) If more than one share of the Series B is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series B so surrendered. If the Corporation pays dividends in Common Stock on more than one share of the Series B held at any one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock payable in connection with such dividend shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series B so held.

Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates
(a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
 
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after (x) the Record Date or (y) the date on which such split or combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
 
 
For purposes of this clause (ii), in determining whether any rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase, or exercise a conversion right for, Common Stock at less than the applicable Average VWAP of the Common Stock on the applicable date, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Corporation receives for such rights, warrants, options, other securities or convertible securities and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. If any right, warrant, option, other security or convertible security described in this clause (ii) is not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such right, warrant, option, other security or convertible security had not been so issued.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall become effective on the date that is immediately after the Record Date.
 
 
 
 
then each Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this clause (iii)(A) shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective on the Record Date.
 
 
 
An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this clause (iii)(B) will occur on the 10th Trading Day from and including the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading Days immediately following and including the date of the Spin-Off, references with respect to the Spin-Off to "the 10 consecutive Trading-Day period" shall be deemed replaced with a period of consecutive Trading Days containing such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the effective date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date and the adjustment in respect of such conversion shall occur immediately prior to the conversion.
provided
If any such dividend or distribution described in this clause (iii) is declared but not paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
 
 
An adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this clause (iv) shall become effective on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution. If any dividend or distribution described in this clause (iv) is declared but not so paid or made, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
 
 
If the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in a Fixed Conversion Rate, no adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate will be made. Any adjustment to a Fixed Conversion Rate made pursuant to this clause (v) shall become effective on the date immediately following the last Trading Day included in the determination of the Average VWAP of the Common Stock for purposes of SP

above; that in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading-Day period commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, references to the "10 consecutive Trading-Day period" with respect to this clause (v) shall be deemed replaced with a period of consecutive Trading Days containing such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Expiration Date and the Conversion Date, and the adjustment in respect of such conversion shall occur immediately prior to the conversion. If the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer but is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchase or all such purchases are rescinded, each new Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Fixed Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
provided
 
(b) The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 12, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of the Corporation's shares (or

If any adjustment to the Fixed Conversions is treated as a distribution to any U.S. Alien Holder which is subject to withholding tax, the Corporation (or Transfer Agent or any paying agent on behalf of the Corporation ) may set off any withholding tax that is required to be collected with respect to such deemed distribution against cash payments and other distributions otherwise deliverable to such Holder.
