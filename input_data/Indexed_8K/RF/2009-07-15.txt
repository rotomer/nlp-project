Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 9, 2009, Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc. ("Morgan Keegan") (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Regions Financial Corporation), Morgan Asset Management, Inc. and three employees, each received a "Wells" notice from the Staff of the Atlanta Regional Office of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") stating that the Staff intends to recommend that the Commission bring enforcement actions for possible violations of the federal securities laws. The potential actions relate to the Staff's investigation of certain mutual funds formerly managed by Morgan Asset Management, Inc. A Wells notice is not a formal allegation nor a finding of wrongdoing. The notice provides the recipients the opportunity to provide their perspective and to address issues raised prior to any formal action being taken by the Commission.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
