Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filed a complaint in United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc. ("Morgan Keegan"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Regions Financial Corporation, alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with auction rate securities ("ARS") that Morgan Keegan underwrote, marketed and sold. The SEC is seeking an injunction against Morgan Keegan for violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as disgorgement, financial penalties and other equitable relief for customers, including repurchase by Morgan Keegan of all ARS that it sold prior to March 20, 2008. Beginning in February 2009, Morgan Keegan commenced a voluntary program to repurchase ARS that it underwrote and sold to the firm's customers, and will extend that repurchase program in the third quarter of 2009 to include ARS that were sold by Morgan Keegan to its customers but were underwritten by other firms. As of June 30, 2009, customers of Morgan Keegan owned approximately $365 million of ARS, and Morgan Keegan held approximately $128 million of ARS on the balance sheet.
On July 21, 2009, the Alabama Securities Commission issued a "Show Cause" order to Morgan Keegan arising out of the ARS matter that is the subject of the SEC complaint described above. The order requires Morgan Keegan to show cause why its registration as a broker-dealer should not be suspended or revoked in the State of Alabama and also why it should not be subject to disgorgement, repurchasing all ARS sold to Alabama residents and payment of costs and penalties.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
