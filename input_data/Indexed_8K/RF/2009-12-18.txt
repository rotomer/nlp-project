EXHIBIT 10.4
Regions Financial Corporation further amends the Plan as follows:
1. Effective January 1, 2010, Section 3.05 is hereby amended to read as follows:
. This Section 3.05, originally adopted on February 27, 2009 and originally effective April 16, 2009, implements a benefit freeze for the period April 16, 2009 through December 31, 2009 (the "Freeze Period"). The benefit freeze described in this Section applies to all Participants in the Plan, including (without limitation of the foregoing) Participants covered under Section 12.19 and Appendix O, as well as Participants covered by Sections 12.02 through 12.18. To the extent that terminology in Appendix O and Sections 12.02 through 12.19 differs from the terminology used below, the same principles shall be applied to any analogous terms.
3.05
Temporary Benefit Freeze
(a) . Effective April 16, 2009 and thereafter until December 31, 2009, the Accrued Benefit of each Participant in the Plan shall be the Participant's Accrued Benefit on April 15, 2009. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no Participant's Accrued Benefit shall increase or decrease after April 16, 2009 and before January 1, 2010 due to changes in the Participant's Average Monthly Earnings, Credited Service, covered compensation or any other factor. The benefit freeze described herein shall not affect the increase in the amount of a Participant's benefit due to the Participant's increasing age (and the consequent effect on the applicable Early Retirement Factor).
Benefit Freeze
(b) . Effective January 1, 2010, accrual of benefits shall resume. Thereafter, the Accrued Benefit of each Participant in the Plan shall be the greater of: (1) the Participant's Accrued Benefit on April 15, 2009; and (2) the Participant's Unfrozen Accrued Benefit. The Unfrozen Accrued Benefit (and all other benefits under the Plan) shall be determined by treating 2008 and 2010 as consecutive years for purposes of Credited Service, Average Monthly Earnings, and any other factors. Specifically, except for purposes of determining the Accrued Benefit as of April 15, 2009, a Participant shall receive no Credited Service for 2009 and the Participant's Compensation for 2009 shall not be considered in determining the Participant's Average Monthly Earnings. Notwithstanding the above, a Participant's service in 2009 shall not be disregarded in determining the Participant's vesting status or eligibility for early retirement benefits or other benefits. Notwithstanding the above, 2009 shall not be disregarded in determining the Participant's age or covered compensation. The benefit freeze described herein shall not affect the increase in the amount of a Participant's benefit due to the Participant's increasing age (and the consequent effect on the applicable Early Retirement Factor).
Resumption of Accruals
 
(c) . Except as specifically provided for in this Section, the benefit freeze provided for in this Section shall override any other provision of the Plan that existed on April 16, 2009, including provisions that purport to apply "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan" or using similar language.
Coordination With Other Provisions
(d) .
Provisions Not Overridden
(1) This Section shall not affect the operation of Sections 1.03 and 4.08(c)(ii) or any other Plan provisions relating to Actuarial Equivalence, Actuarial Value or any similar terms that incorporate by reference statutory or regulatory provisions relating to the mortality table, interest rate, or similar actuarial assumption used in the computation of a Participant's benefit in any form. To the extent that such actuarial assumptions would change due to the operation of such statutory or regulatory provisions (including amendments to such statutory or regulatory provisions) and such changes affect the computation of the Participant's benefit in any form, this Section shall not preclude such changes from taking effect.
(2) This Section shall not affect the operation of Section 4.13 (implementing the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code) to the extent that any statutory or regulatory changes occurring after April 16, 2009 may be incorporated by reference and may affect the computation or payment of a Participant's benefit.
(3) This Section shall not affect changes in benefits that arise solely due to the operation of provisions of Article VIII relating to allocation of benefits upon the termination of the Plan and vesting due to termination or partial termination of the Plan.
(4) This Section shall not affect the operation of Article IX (implementing the limitations in Section 415 of the Code) to the extent that such provisions are incorporated by reference and to the extent that changes in benefits result from the indexing of any limitation therein, the automatic change in any actuarial assumption, or any amendment to the statutory or regulatory provisions implemented by Article IX.
(5) This Section shall not affect the operation of Article X (implementing the requirements of Section 416 of the Code).
(6) This Section shall not affect the operation of Section 11.19 relating to reemployment rights of veterans with respect to qualified military service, or any similar legal requirements applicable upon the reemployment of a veteran.
 
(7) Notwithstanding the benefit freeze described in this Section, a Participant shall continue to earn service towards vesting and eligibility for early retirement benefits.
(8) This Section shall not affect any provisions of Section 12.19 or Appendix O corresponding to the provisions listed in (c)(1) through (c)(7) above.
(d) . Actuarial increases for commencement after age 65 under Section 4.03 (or Section 4.01 of Appendix O) shall not be provided during the Freeze Period, except that: (1) actuarial increases shall be given as provided for up to April 16, 2009; (2) further actuarial increases shall be given for a Participant whose benefit commences in a calendar year after the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70
Actuarial Increases After Normal Retirement Age

/
2
in accordance with Section 401(a)(9)(C)(iii) of the Code and the regulations thereunder; and (3) after the Freeze Period, such actuarial increases shall be provided without regard to the benefit freeze. A Participant to whom this subsection applies during the Freeze Period shall be given a notice of suspension of benefits in accordance with applicable regulations of the Treasury and the Department of Labor.
(e) . The Accrued Benefit of a Participant who has continued to earn Credited Service under Section 1.16(a)(3) (generally, Participants determined to be disabled on or before June 30, 2004) shall be frozen as of April 16, 2009 (with continued accrual after December 31, 2009) in the same manner as an active Participant.
Certain Disabled Participants
2. All other terms, provisions and conditions of the Plan not herein amended shall remain in full force and effect.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Regions Financial Corporation on behalf of itself and all participating Employers has caused this Amendment Number Five to be executed on this 16th day of December, 2009 by its duly authorized officers, effective as provided herein.
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.5
Regions Financial Corporation hereby amends the Plan as follows:
1. Effective January 1, 2010, Section 3.01(f) shall be amended to read as follows:
(f) . This subsection (f), originally adopted on February 27, 2009, implements a benefit freeze for the period from April 16, 2009 to December 31, 2009 (the "Freeze Period"). The benefit freeze described in this Section applies to all Participants in the Supplemental Plan, including Participants eligible for Supplemental Benefits, Participants eligible for Enhanced Benefits, and Participants eligible for the greater of the two benefits.
Temporary Benefit Freeze
(i) . Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e), effective April 16, 2009, no Participant shall accrue any additional benefit in the Plan during the Freeze Period. This benefit freeze shall be implemented as follows. The Supplemental Benefit shall be calculated by determining the benefit in (A) thereof as of April 15, 2009 (the "Freeze Date") using the Participant's Credited Service and Average Monthly Earnings (along with any other factors applicable to such calculation) as of the Freeze Date. The remainder of the calculation of such benefit shall be in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Plan without regard to this subsection (f). The Enhanced Benefit shall be calculated by determining the benefit in (A) thereof as of the Freeze Date using the Participant's Credited Service and Average Monthly Earnings as of the Freeze Date. The estimated Social Security benefit shall be determined using the law in effect on the Freeze Date and all other factors determined as if the Participant had a Termination of Employment on the Freeze Date. The remainder of the calculation of the Enhanced Benefit shall be in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Plan without regard to this subsection (f).
Calculation of Benefits During the Freeze Period
(ii) . Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e), effective January 1, 2010, the Supplemental Benefit shall be calculated by determining the benefit in (A) thereof without regard to service and compensation earned in 2009, and treating 2008 and 2010 as consecutive years. The remainder of the calculation of such benefit shall be in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Plan without regard to this
Calculation of Benefits After the Freeze Period
 
subsection (f). The Enhanced Benefit shall be calculated by determining the benefit in (A) thereof using the Participant's Credited Service and Average Monthly Earnings without regard to any service or compensation earned in 2009, and for this purpose, treating 2008 and 2010 as consecutive years. The remainder of the calculation of the Enhanced Benefit shall be in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Plan without regard to this subsection (f).
(iii) The calculation of the Supplemental Benefit and the Enhanced Benefit, in each case, involves the calculation of the Participant's benefit in the Retirement Plan. The benefit in the Retirement Plan has also been frozen for the period April 16, 2009 through December 31, 2009. However, the benefit determined in this Supplemental Plan during and after the Freeze Period shall take into account the actual benefit in the Retirement Plan as of the date of determination, and not the Freeze Date, as a variety of factors could cause the benefit in the Retirement Plan to increase or decrease notwithstanding the freeze (including, without limitation, changes in the required actuarial assumptions, indexing of the limits under Section 415 of the Code, and the possibility of an amendment unfreezing the Retirement Plan as of a different date than the Supplemental Plan).
2. All other terms, provisions and conditions of the Supplemental Plan not herein amended shall remain in full force and effect.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Regions Financial Corporation on behalf of itself and all participating Employers has caused this Amendment Number Two to be executed on this 16th day of December, 2009 by its duly authorized officers, effective as provided herein.
