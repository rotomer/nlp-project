On May 24, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions") approved 2012 annual bonus opportunities under Regions' Amended and Restated Management Incentive Plan for certain of its officers and key employees, subject to achievement of certain corporate and/or business unit performance goals and individual performance ratings. The bonus opportunity for Regions' named executive officers was pro-rated for the portion of Regions' 2012 fiscal year following its repurchase of the Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program's Capital Purchase Program. The Amended and Restated Management Incentive Plan is included as Exhibit 10.1 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The long-term incentive awards, which are expected to be granted on June 1, 2012, will be made under the Regions Financial Corporation 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan and are structured in the form of restricted stock units, performance stock units and performance units. The vesting of each of these long-term incentive awards is generally contingent on the award recipient remaining employed with Regions through the third anniversary of the date of grant. The vesting and amount of payout under the performance stock unit and performance unit awards is further subject to achievement by Regions of earnings per share ("EPS") growth and return on tangible equity ("ROTE") on both an absolute basis and relative to the EPS growth and ROTE of the companies set forth in the award agreement over the three-year performance period for the awards (2012-2014).

You have been granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "Award") under the Regions Financial Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the terms and conditions of which are incorporated in this document by reference as if fully set forth herein. This document sets out some of the specific terms of your Award and constitutes the Award Agreement required by the Plan. You should retain it for future reference. You should also pay particular attention to the Plan and its prospectus since they set forth other provisions applicable to your Award. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Award Agreement are references to defined terms in the Plan. The prospectus for the Plan and the Plan document itself provide you helpful information and explanations related to your grant. These documents are currently accessible by logging in to your account at Solium Shareworks, the online equity compensation management system for Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions"). If you do not have access to a personal computer and would like copies of the documents, please contact Executive Compensation at (205) 264-7341. You should note that in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Award Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement will control.
The grant date of your Award, the number of shares of Stock underlying your Award and the date on which your Award vests, are set forth in the enclosed grant notice ("Notice of Grant"). The Restricted Period for your Award begins on the grant date and ends on the vesting date, at which time all restrictions will lapse, provided you are still employed by Regions or one of its Subsidiaries as of such date (except as provided below). On such date, the Award will be fully vested, and shares of Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units you were granted will be issued and released to your control.
During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Stock Units will be accounted for by the Company in a bookkeeping account. Since this Award constitutes a grant of Restricted Stock Units, there are no voting rights applicable to these Restricted Stock Units. During the Restricted Period, all ordinary cash dividends (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) that would have been paid upon shares of Stock underlying these Restricted Stock Units had such shares of Stock been issued will be accumulated (and deemed reinvested in shares of Stock based on the then current value of a share of Stock) and paid at the time and to the extent these Restricted Stock Units are vested (the "Dividend Equivalents"). Upon the lapse of restrictions on these Restricted Stock Units and any Dividend Equivalents, you may elect to satisfy any federal tax withholding requirements in whole or in part by reducing the number of shares of Stock that would otherwise be issued to you, to the extent and in the manner allowed by the Plan.
If, during the Restricted Period, any of the following events occurs, this Award will be treated as described below:
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you are or become eligible for Retirement (within the meaning of the Plan) at any time during the Restricted Period and if you are a "specified employee" at the time you separate from service with Regions, the shares of Stock described above shall be issued to you on the date that is six months after your separation from service, all as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.
If your employment with Regions terminates during the Restricted Period for any reason other than those listed above, your Award will be forfeited as of your termination date.
Any amounts paid or payable or shares of Stock delivered or deliverable under this Award shall be subject to claw-back and/or forfeiture in accordance with the terms of Applicable Law or Company policy, as in effect from time to time.
By signing the enclosed Notice of Grant, you acknowledge that you accept this Award on the terms and conditions set forth in this Award Agreement and the Plan and you further acknowledge and agree as follows: (1) That this Award Agreement and the Plan set forth the entire agreement of Regions and you relating to the subject matter of this document and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements and understandings with respect to such subject matter; (2) that Regions and you have made no agreements, representations or warranties relating to the subject matter of this Award Agreement which are not set forth herein; (3) that no provision of this Award Agreement may be amended, modified or waived unless such amendment, modification or waiver is authorized by the Committee and is agreed to in writing signed by an officer of Regions actually authorized to do so, and (4) that this Award Agreement is binding on Regions' successors and assigns. You also agree that Regions, the Board and the Committee, in their oversight and conduct of the business and affairs of Regions, may in good faith cause Regions to act or fail to act in a way that prevents this Award from vesting. This Award Agreement is not intended to and will not be interpreted to impose any liability upon Regions, the Board, the Committee or any officer, agent or employee of Regions for any forfeiture of the Award that results from such action or omission.
