On November 30, 2012, Regions entered into an agreement with a third party investor in Regions Asset Management Company, Inc., a real estate investment trust, pursuant to which the investment was fully redeemed. This resulted in extinguishing a $203 million liability, including accrued, unpaid interest, as well as incurring early termination costs of approximately $42 million on a pre-tax basis. This will result in approximately $38 million in after tax expense for the fourth quarter.
Excluding the early termination costs, during 2012 Regions incurred approximately $28 million of non-interest expenses related to this liability. Approximately $13 million in non-interest expense occurred during the first quarter of the year and approximately $15 million occurred from January through November, the latter of which was not deductible for income tax purposes. These costs will no longer recur.
 
(d) Exhibits. The exhibit listed in the exhibit index is furnished pursuant to Regulation FD as part of this current report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
