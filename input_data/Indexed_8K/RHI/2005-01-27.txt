Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On January 27, 2005, Robert Half International Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The foregoing information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being "furnished" and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such future filing.
 
Item 8.01    Other Events
 
On December 6, 2004, Plaintiffs Ian O'Donnell and David Jolicoeur, ("Plaintiffs"), on behalf of themselves and a putative class of salaried Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers, filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court naming the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, "RHI") as Defendants. The complaint alleges that RHI's salaried Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers based in Massachusetts within the past two years have been misclassified under Massachusetts law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount equal to three times their unpaid overtime compensation alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees, plus costs and legal fees. The complaint also makes similar allegations under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act on behalf of all Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers employed in any state other than Massachusetts and California within the past three years and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees, plus an equal amount as liquidated damages.
 
This litigation is at a very early stage and discovery has not commenced. The case has been removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. At this early phase of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of this proceeding. Based on a preliminary review, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to vigorously defend against the litigation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. REPORTS RECORD REVENUES AND EARNINGS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004
 
MENLO PARK, California, January 27, 2005  Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported record revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, net income was $49.7 million or $.28 per share, on revenues of $754.2 million. Net income for the prior year's fourth quarter was $4.8 million or $.03 per share, on revenues of $517.7 million.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income was $140.6 million or $.79 per share, on revenues of $2.7 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net income was $6.4 million or $.04 per share, on revenues of $2.0 billion.
 
"All of our operations performed well during the quarter," said Harold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half International Inc. "Overall revenues for the company rose 46 percent year over year and 7 percent sequentially, leading to record quarterly revenues and earnings.
 
"We estimate that 17 to 20 percent of our consolidated revenues related directly to Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance work," Messmer said. "The balance of our revenues reflected organic growth of more than 20 percent on a year-over-year basis. This broad-based improvement was particularly noteworthy in our Accountemps and OfficeTeam staffing divisions."
 
The company's Protiviti subsidiary, which specializes in internal audit and business and technology risk consulting, achieved sequential revenue growth in excess of 20 percent in every quarter in 2004. "Fourth-quarter revenues for Protiviti were more than triple those of the same period in 2003," Messmer said. "Protiviti has been expanding its services steadily in areas such as forensic and fraud investigations, litigation consulting, information technology security, financial-process improvement, business continuity and enterprise-wide risk management."
 
Messmer continued: "We believe there also will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley-related initiatives. This includes remediation efforts to improve controls, annual testing to support ongoing compliance, initial efforts by non-accelerated filers, and development of long-term compliance processes and programs."
