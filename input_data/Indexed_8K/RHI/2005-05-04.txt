Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Approval of Stock Incentive Plan
 
On May 3, 2005, following stockholder approval at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Stock Incentive Plan (The "Plan") became effective and replaced the Company's five then existing equity plans. Employees (including officers), consultants and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to participate under the Plan.
 
The Plan provides for the grant of stock options (both nonstatutory and incentive stock options), restricted stock, stock units, and stock appreciation rights. Awards under the Plan will be evidenced by an agreement with the Plan participant or a notice to the Plan participant. 10,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock ("Shares") are available for awards under the Plan. Under the Plan, no participant may be granted awards covering in excess of 2,000,000 Shares per fiscal year, and nonemployee directors may be granted awards covering no more than 15,000 Shares per fiscal year. Such Share amounts may be adjusted by the Plan administrator in the event of stock splits and other events.
 
Awards under the Plan to the Company's officers (within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) must be made subject to a performance condition utilizing the Company's diluted earnings per share as a performance goal.
 
Under the Plan, all awards granted to a participant fully vest upon the participant's death or termination due to total and permanent disability (as defined in the Plan). In addition, all awards granted to an individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act also vest upon a change in control or such individual's retirement (as such terms are defined in the Plan). Each stock option or stock appreciation right held by an individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act that vests as described in this paragraph will remain outstanding until the earlier of its exercise or its remaining term.
 
The Board or Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") may amend the Plan at any time, subject to any required stockholder approval. The Board or Compensation Committee may terminate the Plan at any time, and the Plan is currently set to terminate at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless re-adopted or extended by the stockholders prior to or on such date.
 
The foregoing description of the Plan is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, which is filed as an exhibit hereto.
 
Approval of Annual Performance Bonus Plan
 
On February 15, 2005, the Board approved the amendment and restatement, effective May 3, 2005, of the Company's Annual Performance Bonus Plan (the "Performance Plan"), subject to approval by the Company's stockholders. At the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 3, 2005, the Company's stockholders approved the Performance Plan.
 
The Performance Plan provides for the annual grant of performance-based cash bonuses to elected executive officers and to such other senior executives as may be designated from time to time by the Performance Plan administrator (currently the Compensation Committee). Bonuses are paid based on the Company's performance against a diluted earnings per share target set by the Performance Plan administrator at the beginning of the performance period. The Performance Plan administrator has the authority to alter, amend or discontinue the Performance Plan at any time without stockholder approval, except as required by applicable law. No individual may receive a bonus in any year in excess of $9,000,000.
Material changes from the prior version of the Performance Plan are:

Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Board of Directors may authorize one or more officers of RHI to grant Awards and the Committee may designate persons other than members of the Committee to carry out its responsibilities, and the Committee may prescribe such conditions and limitations as it may deem appropriate, except that the Board of Directors or the Committee may not delegate its authority with regard to Awards to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or Awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.

The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under RHI's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or under any power that RHI may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
 
 
(a)        . Only Eligible Participants may be granted Restricted Shares, Stock Units, NSOs or SARs. In addition, only individuals who are employed as common-law employees by the Company may be granted ISOs.
General Rule
 
(b)        . In any fiscal year of RHI, no individual shall receive Options, SARs, Restricted Shares and/or Stock Units covering in excess of 2,000,000 Shares in the aggregate; provided, however, that Outside Directors may only receive Awards covering up to 15,000 Shares in the aggregate per Outside Director in any fiscal year of RHI. The limitations under this Subsection shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the adjustment provisions of the Plan.
Limitation on Awards
 
 
(a)        . Shares offered under the Plan shall be authorized but unissued Shares or treasury Shares. The maximum aggregate number of Options, SARs, Stock Units and Restricted Shares awarded under the Plan shall not exceed 10,000,000 Shares. This limit shall be subject to the provisions of the next Subsection and shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the adjustment provisions of the Plan. No fractional Shares shall be issued under the Plan.
Basic Limitation
 
(b)        . If Restricted Shares are forfeited, then such Shares shall again become available for Awards under the Plan. If Stock Units, Options or SARs are forfeited or terminate for any reason before being exercised, then the corresponding Shares shall again become available for Awards under the Plan. If Stock Units are settled, then only the number of Shares (if any) actually issued in settlement of such Stock Units shall reduce the number of Shares available under the Plan and the balance shall again become available for Awards under the Plan. If SARs are exercised, then only the number of Shares (if any) actually issued in settlement of such SARs shall reduce the number of Shares available under the Plan and the balance shall again become available for Awards under the Plan.
Additional Shares
 
(c)        . Any dividend equivalents paid or credited under the Plan shall not be applied against the number of Restricted Shares, Stock Units, Options or SARs available for Awards, whether or not such dividend equivalents are converted into Stock Units.
Dividend Equivalents
 
 
(a)        . Each grant of Restricted Shares under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Restricted Share Award between the recipient and RHI. Such Restricted Shares shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan, including those specified in any Other Agreement. The provisions of the various Restricted Share Awards entered into under the Plan need not be identical.
Restricted Share Award
 
(b)        . Subject to the following sentence and applicable law, Restricted Shares may be sold or awarded under the Plan for such consideration as the Committee may determine, including (without limitation) cash, cash equivalents, past services and future services. To the extent that an Award consists of newly issued Restricted Shares, the Award recipient shall furnish consideration with a value not less than the par value of such Restricted Shares in the form of cash, cash equivalents, or past services rendered to the Company, as the Committee may determine. To the extent an Award of Restricted Shares consists solely of treasury shares, the Award may be made without consideration furnished by the recipient.
Payment for Awards
 
(c)        . Each Award of Restricted Shares shall be subject to vesting. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Restricted Share Award or as specified in any Other Agreement. Unless the Restricted Share Award or an Other Agreement provides otherwise, each grant of Restricted Shares shall vest with respect to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares covered by the grant on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that the Participant's Service has not terminated on the applicable vesting date. A Restricted Share Award may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant's Protiviti Retirement, Staffing/Headquarters Retirement, a Change in Control, or other events, including as provided in any Other Agreement. To the extent that an Award of Restricted Shares has not vested prior to, or concurrently with, termination of a Participant's Service, such Award shall immediately terminate.
Vesting

Except as provided herein, or in a Restricted Share Award, or as required by applicable law, Restricted Shares shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor's process, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law. Any act in violation of this Subsection shall be void. However, this Subsection shall not preclude a Participant from designating a beneficiary who will receive any outstanding Restricted Shares in the event of the Participant's death, nor shall it preclude a transfer of Restricted Shares by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Assignment or Transfer of Restricted Shares
 
 
(a)        . Each grant of an Option under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Award between the Optionee and RHI. Such Option shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions which are not inconsistent with the Plan, including those specified in any Other Agreement. The Stock Option Award shall specify whether the Option is an ISO or an NSO. The provisions of the various Stock Option Awards entered into under the Plan need not be identical. A Stock Option Award may not provide that a new Option will be granted automatically to the Optionee when he or she exercises a prior Option and pays the Exercise Price.
Stock Option Award
 
(b)        . Each Stock Option Award shall specify the number of Shares that are subject to the Option and shall provide for the adjustment of such number in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the Plan. The maximum aggregate number of ISOs awarded under the Plan shall not exceed the number of Shares subject to the Plan under Section 5(a). The limitation of this Subsection shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the adjustment provisions of the Plan.
Number of Shares
 
(c)        . Each Stock Option Award shall specify the Exercise Price. The Exercise Price of an Option shall not be less than 100 percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. Subject to the foregoing in this Subsection, the Exercise Price under any Option shall be determined by the Committee at its sole discretion. The Exercise Price shall be payable in one of the forms permitted under the Plan.
Exercise Price
 
(d)        . Unless the Stock Option Award or an Other Agreement provides otherwise, each Option shall become exercisable with respect to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares covered by such Option on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that the Participant's Service has not terminated on the applicable vesting date. The term of an Option shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant unless the Stock Option Award provides for a shorter term. A Stock Option Award may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Optionee's Protiviti Retirement, Staffing/Headquarters Retirement, a Change in Control, or other events, including as provided in any Other Agreement, and may provide for expiration prior to the end of its term in the event of the termination of the Optionee's Service, subject to the provisions of any Other Agreement. Options may be awarded in combination with SARs, and such an Award may provide that the Options will not be exercisable unless the related SARs are forfeited. Subject to the foregoing in this Subsection, the Committee at its sole discretion shall determine when all or any installment of an Option is to become exercisable and when an Option is to expire.
Exercisability and Term
 
(e)        . Except as set forth in a Stock Option Award, or as provided by an Other Agreement, with respect to an NSO, during an Optionee's lifetime, his Option(s) shall be exercisable only by him and shall not be transferable, and in the event of an Optionee's death, his Option(s) shall not be transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Nontransferability
 
(f)        . Each Stock Option Award shall set forth the extent to which the Optionee shall have the right to exercise the Option following termination of the Optionee's Service, and the right to exercise the Option of any executors or administrators of the Optionee's estate or any person who has acquired such Option(s) directly from the Optionee by bequest or inheritance. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, need not be uniform among all Options issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of Service. Unless the Stock Option Award or an Other Agreement provides otherwise, Options which are unvested at the time of an Optionee's termination of Service shall expire upon such termination, and any vested Options shall remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of 90 days following such termination and the expiration of the Option's term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if exercise of an Option during the 90-day period described in the previous sentence would subject the Optionee to liability under Section 16 of the Exchange Act by reason of transactions by the Optionee prior to the Optionee's termination of service ("Prior Transaction"), such Option shall be exercisable until the earliest of (a) its normal termination date and (b) the 30
Exercise of Options Upon Termination of Service
th
day after the first date upon which the Optionee would not be subject to Section 16 liability by reason of the Prior Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Optionee's Misconduct Termination, effective as of the date notice of such termination is given by the Committee to the Optionee, all of the Optionee's vested and unvested Options shall automatically terminate and lapse, unless the Committee shall determine otherwise.
 
(g)        . Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options. The foregoing notwithstanding, no modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the Optionee, impair his rights or increase his obligations under such Option. Options may not be repriced without the approval of RHI's stockholders.
Modification, Extension and Renewal of Options
 
 
(a)        . The entire Exercise Price of Shares issued under the Plan shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America, as permitted under this Section. Payment may be made by any combination of the methods described in this Section.
General Rule
 
(b)        . Payment may be made by cash, check, wire transfer or similar means, subject to the requirements of applicable law.
Cash
 
(c)        . Payment may be made all or in part by surrendering, or attesting to the ownership of, Shares which have been owned by the Optionee or his representative for such period of time
Surrender of Stock
 
required to avoid RHI's recognition of additional compensation expense with respect to the Option for financial reporting purposes as a result of the surrender or attestation of such previously owned shares. Such Shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date when the new Shares are purchased under the Plan.
 
(d)        . To the extent permitted by applicable law, payment may be made all or in part by delivery (on a form prescribed by the Committee) of an irrevocable direction to a securities broker to sell Shares and to deliver all or part of the sale proceeds to RHI in payment of the aggregate Exercise Price and applicable tax withholding.
Cashless Exercise
 
(e)        . To the extent that a Stock Option Award so provides, payment may be made in any other form that is consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules.
Other Forms of Payment
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or in any agreement under the Plan, the Committee may disallow the use of any type of payment that the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, would result in adverse accounting or legal consequences to the Company or Affiliate.
 
 
(a)        . Each grant of a SAR under the Plan shall be evidenced by a SAR Award between the Optionee and RHI. Such SAR shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan, including those specified in any other Agreement. The provisions of the various SAR Awards entered into under the Plan need not be identical. A SAR Award may not provide that a new SAR will be granted automatically to the holder thereof when he or she exercises a prior SAR.
SAR Award
 
(b)        . Each SAR Award shall specify the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains and shall provide for the adjustment of such number in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the Plan.
Number of Shares
 
(c)        . Each SAR Award shall specify the Exercise Price, which may not be less than 100 percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. A SAR Award may specify an Exercise Price that varies in accordance with a predetermined formula while the SAR is outstanding.
Exercise Price
 
(d)        . Unless the SAR Award or an Other Agreement provides otherwise, each SAR shall become exercisable with respect to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares covered by such SAR on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that the Participant's Service has not terminated on the applicable vesting date. The term of the SAR shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant unless the SAR Award provides for a shorter term. A SAR Award may provide for accelerated exercisability in the event of the Optionee's Protiviti Retirement, Staffing/Headquarters Retirement, a Change in Control, or other events, including as provided in any Other Agreement, and may provide for expiration prior to the end of its term in the event of the termination of the Optionee's Service, subject to the provisions of any Other Agreement. SARs may be awarded in combination with Options, and such an Award may provide that the SARs will not be exercisable unless the related Options are forfeited. A SAR may be included in an ISO only at the time of grant but may be included in an NSO at the time of grant or thereafter.
Exercisability and Term
A SAR granted under the Plan may provide that it will be exercisable only in the event of a Change in Control.
 
(e)        . The SAR Award may provide that, upon exercise of a SAR, the Optionee (or any person having the right to exercise the SAR after his or her death) shall receive from RHI (a) Shares, (b) cash or (c) a combination of Shares and cash. Unless otherwise provided in the SAR Award or an Other Agreement, upon exercise of a SAR, the Optionee (or any person having the right to exercise the SAR after his or her death) shall receive Shares from RHI. The amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of Shares received upon exercise of SARs shall, in the aggregate, be equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value (on the date of surrender) of the Shares subject to the SARs exceeds the Exercise Price. Unless the SAR Award or an Other Agreement provides otherwise, SARs which are unvested at the time of an Optionee's termination of Service
Exercise of SARs
 
shall expire upon such termination, and any vested SARs which have not been exercised shall remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of 90 days following such termination and the expiration of the SAR's term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if exercise of a SAR during the 90-day period described in the previous sentence would subject the Participant to liability under Section 16 of the Exchange Act by reason of transactions by the Participant prior to the Participant's termination of service, such SAR shall be exercisable until the earliest of (a) its normal termination date and (b) the 30
th
day after the first date upon which the Participant would not be subject to Section 16 liability by reason of the prior transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Optionee's Misconduct Termination, effective as of the date notice of such termination is given by the Committee to the Optionee, all of the Optionee's vested and unvested SARs shall automatically terminate and lapse, unless the Committee shall determine otherwise.
 
(f)        . Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding SARs. The foregoing notwithstanding, no modification of a SAR shall, without the consent of the Optionee, impair his rights or increase his obligations under such SAR. SARs may not be repriced without the approval of RHI's stockholders.
Modification or Assumption of SARs
 
 
(a)        . Each grant of Stock Units under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Stock Unit Award between the recipient and RHI. Such Stock Units shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan, including those specified in any Other Agreement. The provisions of the various Stock Unit Awards entered into under the Plan need not be identical.
Stock Unit Award
 
(b)        . To the extent that an Award is granted in the form of Stock Units, no cash consideration shall be required of the Award recipients.
Payment for Awards
 
(c)        . Each Award of Stock Units shall be subject to vesting. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Stock Unit Award or as specified in any Other Agreement. Unless the Stock Unit Award or an Other Agreement provides otherwise, each grant of Stock Units shall become exercisable with respect to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares covered by the grant on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that the Participant's Service has not terminated on the applicable vesting date. A Stock Unit Award may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant's Protiviti Retirement, Staffing/Headquarters Retirement, a Change in Control, or other events, including as provided in any Other Agreement. To the extent that an Award of Stock Units has not vested prior to, or concurrently with, termination of a Participant's Service, such Award shall immediately terminate.
Vesting Conditions
 
(d)        . The holders of Stock Units shall have no voting rights. Prior to settlement or forfeiture, any Stock Unit awarded under the Plan may, at the Committee's discretion, carry with it a right to dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one Share while the Stock Unit is outstanding. Dividend equivalents may be converted into additional Stock Units. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, in the form of Shares, or in a combination of both. Prior to distribution, any dividend equivalents which are not paid shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Stock Units to which they attach.
Voting and Dividend Rights
 
(e)        . Settlement of vested Stock Units may be made in the form of (a) cash, (b) Shares or (c) any combination of both, as determined by the Committee. Methods of converting Stock Units into cash may include (without limitation) a method based on the average Fair Market Value of Shares over a series of trading days. Vested Stock Units may be settled in a lump sum or in installments. The distribution may occur or commence when all vesting conditions applicable to the Stock Units have been satisfied or have lapsed, or it may be deferred, in accordance with applicable law, to any later date. The amount of a deferred distribution may be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents. Until an Award of Stock Units is settled, the number of such Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the adjustment provisions of the Plan.
Form and Time of Settlement of Stock Units
 
(f)        . Any Stock Units Award that becomes payable after the recipient's death shall be distributed to the recipient's beneficiary or beneficiaries. Each recipient of a Stock Units Award under the Plan shall designate one or more beneficiaries for this purpose by filing the prescribed form with RHI. A beneficiary designation may be changed by filing the prescribed form with RHI at any time before the Award recipient's death. If no beneficiary was designated or if no designated beneficiary survives the Award recipient, then any Stock Units Award that becomes payable after the recipient's death shall be distributed to the recipient's estate.
Death of Recipient
 
(g)        . A holder of Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of RHI. Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of RHI, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Stock Unit Award.
Creditors' Rights
 
(h)        . Except as provided herein, or in a Stock Unit Award, or as required by applicable law, Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor's process, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law. Any act in violation of this Subsection shall be void. However, this Subsection shall not preclude a Participant from designating a beneficiary who will receive any outstanding Stock Units in the event of the Participant's death, nor shall it preclude a transfer of Stock Units by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Assignment or Transfer of Stock Units
 
 
A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Award until the date of the issuance of a stock certificate for any Shares covered by such award. No adjustments shall be made, except as provided in the adjustment provisions of the Plan.
 
 
(a)        Any Award to an Executive Officer shall be made subject to a Performance Condition with respect to which the Performance Goal shall be Earnings Per Share during the Performance Period in addition to any vesting requirements imposed upon such grant.
 
(b)        Awards to persons other than Executive Officers may, but need not, be made subject to a Performance Condition utilizing any Performance Goal in addition to any vesting requirements imposed upon such grant. The determination as to whether any such grant is subject to a Performance Condition shall be made on or prior to the date of grant.
 
(c)        The Performance Condition shall operate as specified in this Section.
 
(d)        Except in the case of Awards not intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), if an Award is made subject to a Performance Condition, the Committee shall be required to establish the Performance Period and Target Performance Goal for such award no later than the time permitted by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
(e)        After the public release by RHI of its results for the last fiscal quarter of the Performance Period, the Chief Financial Officer shall, with respect to each Award made subject to a Performance Condition, (a) calculate the Actual Performance Goal, (b) determine the Multiplier, (c) calculate the Final Award, and (d) deliver such calculation to the Committee.
 
(f)        The Committee shall review the information submitted by the Chief Financial Officer and certify, in writing, each Final Award.
 
(g)        To the extent that a Final Award is less than the Original Award, the difference shall be forfeited by the Participant. The Final Award shall bear the same vesting schedule as the Original Award, and on each vesting date the percentage of the Final Award that vests shall be the same as the percentage of the Original Award that would have vested had there been no forfeiture as a result of the Performance Condition.
 
(h)        If all or a portion of an Award made subject to a Performance Condition shall vest prior to the Certification Date by reason of death, Total and Permanent Disability or, if applicable, a Change in Control, then the Performance Condition shall be cancelled and none of such Award shall be subject to reduction or forfeiture as provided by the Performance Condition. Such Award shall be treated in accordance with the terms of this plan relating to vested shares.
 
(i)        If all or a portion of an Award made subject to a Performance Condition shall vest prior to the Certification Date for any reason other than death, Total and Permanent Disability or a Change in Control, no portion of the Award shall be released to or exercised by the Participant until after the Certification Date. No such vesting prior to the Certification Date shall in any way be deemed a satisfaction, waiver or cancellation of the Performance Condition, and such Award shall remain subject to reduction and forfeiture as provided by the Performance Condition.
 
(j)        Once established, a Performance Condition for an Executive Officer may not be waived or cancelled by the Committee.
 
 
Subject to the last sentence of this Section, a Participant's Service shall terminate when such person ceases to be an Eligible Participant as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. A Participant's Service does not terminate if he or she is a common-law employee and goes on a bona fide leave of absence of less than six (6) consecutive months that was approved by the Company in writing and the terms of the leave provide for continued service crediting, or when continued service crediting is required by applicable law. However, for purposes of determining whether an Option is entitled to ISO status, a common-law employee's Service will be treated as terminating ninety (90) days after such employee went on leave, unless such employee's right to return to active work is guaranteed by law or by a contract. Service terminates in any event when the approved leave ends, unless such employee immediately returns to active work. The Committee determines which leaves count toward Service, and when Service terminates for all purposes under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Outside Director's Service shall terminate when he or she is neither a member of the Board of Directors or a consultant to RHI.
 
 
All Awards granted to any Participant shall vest upon such Participant's death or termination of the Participant's Service due to Total and Permanent Disability.
 
 
Any Award held by an individual who is a Section 16 Participant at either or both of (a) the grant date of such Award or (b) the effective date of the Change in Control, shall vest upon the effective date of such Change in Control. Any Award held by an individual who is a Section 16 Participant at either or both of (a) the grant date of such Award or (b) the effective date of such individual's Outside Director Retirement, Protiviti Retirement or Staffing/Headquarters Retirement, as the case may be, shall vest upon the effective date of such retirement. Any Options or SARs held by a Section 16 Participant which vest by reason of the provisions of this Section or by reason of death or Total and Permanent Disability shall remain outstanding until the earlier of its exercise or its original term.
 
 
(a)        . In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Stock, or stock split or reverse stock split, a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in a form other than Shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Shares, a recapitalization,
Adjustments
 
reorganization, merger, liquidation, a spin-off, exchange of shares or a similar occurrence (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), the Committee shall make such adjustments as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate in one or more of:
 
(i)        The number of Shares, Options, SARs, Restricted Shares and Stock Units available for future Awards under the Plan;
 
(ii)        The per person per fiscal year limitations on Awards under the Plan and the maximum aggregate number of ISOs that may be awarded under the Plan;
 
(iii)        The number of Shares covered by each outstanding Award;
 
(iv)        The Exercise Price under each outstanding Option and SAR; or
 
(v)        The number of Stock Units included in any prior Award which has not yet been settled.
 
Except as provided in this Section, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issue by RHI of stock of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class.
 
(b)        . To the extent not previously exercised or settled, Options, SARs and Stock Units shall terminate immediately prior to the dissolution or liquidation of RHI.
Dissolution or Liquidation
 
(c)        . In the event that RHI is a party to a merger or other reorganization, outstanding Awards shall be subject to the agreement of merger or reorganization. Such agreement may provide for:
Reorganizations
 
(i)        The continuation of the outstanding Awards by RHI, if RHI is a surviving corporation;
 
(ii)        The assumption of the outstanding Awards by the surviving corporation or its parent or subsidiary;
 
(iii)        The substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent or subsidiary of its own awards for the outstanding Awards;
 
(iv)        Full exercisability or vesting and accelerated expiration of the outstanding Awards; or
 
(v)        Settlement of the full value of the outstanding Awards in cash or cash equivalents followed by cancellation of such Awards.
 
(d)        . Except as provided in this Section, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class. Any issue by RHI of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of Shares subject to an Award or the Exercise Price. The grant of an Award pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of RHI to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure, to merge or consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
Reservation of Rights
 
 
RHI may grant awards under other plans or programs. Such awards may be settled in the form of Shares issued under this Plan. Such Shares shall be treated for all purposes under the Plan like Shares issued in settlement of Stock Units and shall, when issued, reduce the number of Shares available under the Plan.
 
 
No Option may be exercised and no Stock may be issued pursuant to an Option or transferred pursuant to a Restricted Share award unless the Committee shall determine that such exercise, issuance or transfer complies
 
with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, applicable state securities laws, and rules and regulations promulgated under each of the foregoing, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Stock may then be listed or quotation system upon which the Stock may be quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for RHI with respect to such compliance. If the Stock subject to this Plan is not registered under the Securities Act and under applicable state securities laws, the Committee may require that the Participant deliver to RHI such documents as counsel for RHI may determine are necessary or advisable in order to substantiate compliance with applicable securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In no event shall RHI deliver, or be deemed obligated to deliver, cash in lieu of any Share by reason of any failure to satisfy the foregoing provisions.
 
So long as any restrictions or obligations imposed pursuant to this Plan shall apply to a share, each certificate evidencing such share shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions and restrictions. In addition, RHI may instruct its transfer agent that shares of Stock evidenced by such certificates may not be transferred without the written consent of RHI. Any attempt to dispose of such shares of Stock in contravention of such terms, conditions and restrictions shall be invalid. Certificates representing shares that have not vested or with respect to which minimum withholding taxes have not been paid will be held in custody by RHI or such bank or other institution designated by the Committee.
 
 
(a)        . To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, a Participant or his or her successor shall make arrangements satisfactory to RHI for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise in connection with the Plan. RHI shall not be required to issue any Shares or make any cash payment under the Plan until such obligations are satisfied. In the event that such withholding taxes are not paid on a timely basis, as determined by RHI in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted by law RHI shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cause such withholding taxes to be satisfied by reducing the number of Shares or cash (if applicable) deliverable or by offsetting such withholding taxes against amounts otherwise due from the Company to the Participant. If withholding taxes are paid by reduction of the number of Shares deliverable to Optionee, such shares shall be valued at the Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.
General
 
(b)        . Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a Participant may satisfy all or part of his or her minimum withholding or income tax obligations by having RHI withhold all or a portion of any Shares that otherwise would be issued to him or her or by surrendering all or a portion of any Shares that he or she previously acquired. Subject to applicable law and accounting considerations, such Shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date when taxes otherwise would be withheld in cash. A Participant may elect to surrender, or attest to the ownership of, previously acquired Shares in excess of the amount required to satisfy his or her minimum withholding or income tax obligations provided that such Shares have been held by the Participant for such period of time required to avoid RHI's recognition of additional compensation expense for financial reporting purposes as a result of the surrender or attestation of such previously owned shares.
Share Withholding
 
 
No provision of the Plan, nor any right or Award granted under the Plan, shall be construed to give any person any right to become, to be treated as, or to remain an Eligible Participant. RHI and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates reserve the right to terminate any person's Service at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. No provision of the Plan nor any right or Award granted under the Plan shall be construed to create any obligation on the part of the Board of Directors to nominate any Outside Director for reelection by RHI's stockholders, or confer upon any Outside Director the right to remain a member of the Board of Directors for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.
 
 
(a)        . The Plan, as set forth herein, shall terminate automatically on the meeting of the stockholders of RHI in 2008, unless re-adopted or extended by RHI's stockholders prior to or on such date and may be terminated on any earlier date by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, as described in the next Subsection.
Term of the Plan
 
(b)        . The Board of Directors or, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules or regulations, the Compensation Committee may amend or terminate the Plan at any time and from time to time. Rights and obligations under any Award granted before amendment or termination of the Plan shall not be materially impaired by such amendment or termination, except with consent of the person to whom the Award was granted. An amendment of the Plan shall be subject to the approval of RHI's stockholders to the extent required by applicable laws, regulations or rules, including, but not limited to, any applicable rules or regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, no material amendment may be made to the plan without the approval of RHI's stockholders.
Right to Amend or Terminate the Plan
 
(c)        . No Shares shall be issued or sold under the Plan after the termination thereof, except upon exercise of an Award granted prior to such termination. The termination of the Plan, or any amendment thereof, shall not adversely affect any Shares previously issued or any Awards previously granted under the Plan.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
 
This Plan shall become effective upon its approval by RHI's stockholders. Upon its effectiveness, the Plan shall supersede the Existing Equity Plans such that no further awards shall be made under the Existing Equity Plans. This Plan shall not, in any way, affect awards under the Existing Equity Plans that are outstanding as of the date this Plan becomes effective. If RHI's stockholders do not approve this Plan, no Awards will be made under this Plan and the Existing Equity Plans will continue in effect in accordance with their terms.
