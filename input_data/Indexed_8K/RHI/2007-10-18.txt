Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 18, 2007, Robert Half International Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The foregoing information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being "furnished" and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such future filing.
Item 8.01    Other Events.
On September 24, 2007, Plaintiff Van Williamson, on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers, filed a complaint in California Superior Court naming the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. The complaint alleges that salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers based in California were not provided meal periods, paid rest periods, and accurate itemized wage statements. It seeks one hour of wages for each employee for each meal and rest period missed during the statutory liability period. It also seeks an unspecified amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the alleged failure to provide the meal and rest periods and accurate itemized wage statements. The allegations in the complaint are substantially similar to the allegations included in the complaint filed by Mark Lafitte against the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries on September 10, 2004, and described most recently in Note G to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) of the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. At this early stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts will be provided in the financial statements to be included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2007. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to vigorously defend against the litigation.
Item 9.01    Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
