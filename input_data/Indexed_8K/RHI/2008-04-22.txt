Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 22, 2008, Robert Half International Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2008. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The foregoing information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being "furnished" and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such future filing.
Item 8.01    Other Events.
On December 6, 2004, Plaintiffs Ian O'Donnell and David Jolicoeur, on behalf of themselves and a putative class of salaried Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers, filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court, later removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. As previously reported, on January 9, 2008, the Court denied motions brought by the Plaintiffs: (1) for reconsideration of the Court's denial of conditional certification of their federal claims as a collective action on behalf of a group of Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers and (2) for certification of that question to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. In the same January 9, 2008 decision, the Court also denied cross-motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' salary basis claims. Finally, the Court reserved judgment regarding Plaintiffs' motion for certification of a class based on state law claims. On March 27, 2008, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to certify a state law class. Plaintiffs have petitioned for permission to appeal the Court's March 27, 2008 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which petition the Company will oppose. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict its outcome or a range of loss, should a loss occur. Accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. Reference is made to Part I, Item 3 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 for a complete description of this case.
Item 9.01    Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d)    Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
