The Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 and the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, contained disclosure regarding Plaintiffs Ian O'Donnell and David Jolicoeur. As disclosed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Plaintiffs petitioned the Court for permission to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit the Court's March 27, 2008 decision denying their motion for conditional certification. On July 14, 2008, the Court denied the petition. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict its outcome or a range of loss, should a loss occur.
