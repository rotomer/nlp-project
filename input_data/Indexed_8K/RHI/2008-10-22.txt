Item 2.02    Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 22, 2008, Robert Half International Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings for the third fiscal quarter of 2008. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The foregoing information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being "furnished" and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such future filing.
Item 8.01    Other Events.
On September 16, 2008, Plaintiff Donald R. Green, on behalf of himself and a putative class of all temporary staffing employees in California, filed a complaint in California Superior Court naming the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. The complaint alleges that temporary employees in California were improperly denied expense reimbursement and wages for time purportedly spent preparing for, traveling to, and attending interviews with alleged clients of Defendants. Plaintiff seeks penalties and equitable and legal remedies under Section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code and Sections 1194 and 2802 of the California Labor Code. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur from this proceeding. Accordingly, no amounts will be provided in the financial statements to be included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2008. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to vigorously defend against the litigation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. REPORTS REVENUES AND EARNINGS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008
MENLO PARK, California, October 22, 2008  Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, net income was $65.8 million or $.43 per share, on revenues of $1.16 billion. Net income for the prior year's third quarter was $74.0 million or $.46 per share, on revenues of $1.18 billion.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net income was $211.2 million or $1.37 per share, on revenues of $3.61 billion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net income was $217.4 million or $1.32 per share, on revenues of $3.43 billion.
Harold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Robert Half International Inc., said: "Our third-quarter results clearly were impacted by the turmoil in the global financial markets. Revenues were down 2 percent from the third quarter of last year and income per share declined 6 percent during this period. Clients became increasingly cautious with their hiring actions as the quarter progressed."
Messmer pointed out that the quarter was not without its bright spots. "Revenues from our international staffing operations, which make up 30 percent of total staffing revenue, grew 15 percent year over year on a constant-currency basis," he said. "Our technology division also reported positive year-over-year revenue growth."
Messmer noted that the company's return on equity was 26 percent for the third quarter and has averaged 26 percent for the past five years.
