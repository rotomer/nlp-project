On April 22, 2009, Robert Half International Inc. issued a press release reporting earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The foregoing information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being "furnished" and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such future filing.
Item 8.01    Other Events.
On February 26, 2009, Plaintiff Annette Johnson, on behalf of herself and a putative class of all current and former non-exempt employees of the Company, filed a Complaint in California Superior Court naming the Company as Defendant. The Complaint alleges that the Company failed to calculate properly the overtime owed to non-exempt employees in California when it allegedly failed to include certain bonus payments in overtime calculations. Plaintiff seeks the alleged additional overtime amounts, interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. In addition, Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the purported violations. While the Complaint has not been served on the Company, and no Answer has been filed, the Company is engaged in a preliminary review of the allegations included in the Complaint. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding. Accordingly, no amounts will be provided in the financial statements to be included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2009.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. REPORTS REVENUES AND EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009
MENLO PARK, California, April 22, 2009  Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, net income was $8.8 million or $.06 per share, on revenues of $823.3 million. Net income for the prior year's first quarter was $70.8 million or $.45 per share, on revenues of $1.23 billion.
"The labor markets in the United States and around the globe were extremely weak during the first quarter, with the U.S. unemployment rate reaching a 25-year high of 8.5 percent in March," said Harold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half International. "Our experienced field and corporate management teams did an excellent job of aggressively managing costs in response to the challenging economic environment.
"Robert Half International remains in solid financial condition with virtually no debt, and we are confident in our ability to weather this cycle," Messmer said. "We also believe the company is in a good position to grow market share as some of our competitors contract their operations."

Certain information contained in this press release may be deemed forward-looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the company's future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as "estimate", "forecast", "project", "plan", "intend", "believe", "expect", "anticipate", or variations or negatives thereof, or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the global financial and economic situation; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the company's ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the company's services, on the company's ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients' premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the company's ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the company's ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the company's reliance on short-term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the company's SEC filings; the ability of the company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the company's computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted; and the possibility that the company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting.
Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities.
Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the company's business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. The company undertakes no obligation to update information contained in this release.
