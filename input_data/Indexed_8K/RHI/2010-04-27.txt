The foregoing information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being "furnished" and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such future filing.
 
The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, contained disclosure regarding a complaint filed in California Superior Court against the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries by Plaintiff Mark Laffitte, on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers (the "Laffitte Matter"). As the Company disclosed in its previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on August 15, 2008, the California Superior Court stayed the litigation pending the California Supreme Court's ruling in another case unrelated to the Company titled .

However, the ruling in may have a material adverse bearing on the Company's position in the Laffitte Matter.

On April 23, 2010, Plaintiffs David Opalinski and James McCabe, on behalf of themselves and a putative class of similarly situated Staffing Managers, filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey naming the Company and one of its subsidiaries as Defendants. The Complaint alleges that salaried Staffing Managers located throughout the U.S. have been misclassified as exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime pay requirements. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime on behalf of themselves and the class they purport to represent. Plaintiffs also seek an unspecified amount for statutory penalties, attorneys' fees and other damages. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding and, accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the Company's financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to vigorously defend against the litigation.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. REPORTS REVENUES AND EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010
MENLO PARK, California, April 27, 2010  Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, net income was $8.5 million or $.05 per share, on revenues of $737.2 million. Net income for the prior year's first quarter was $8.8 million or $.06 per share, on revenues of $823.3 million.
"We are beginning to see improvement in the demand for our professional staffing services as a result of better economic conditions in North America and abroad," said Harold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half International. "First-quarter revenues for our staffing operations were up 2 percent on a constant-currency basis from the results we reported for the fourth quarter."
Messmer added, "Our permanent placement operations performed particularly well during the quarter, growing 9 percent on a constant-currency basis versus the fourth quarter of 2009. We believe this relates directly to the depth and severity of personnel cuts made during the recession. Many businesses have had to hire at the first sign of a pickup in demand as well as immediately replace workers lost due to turnover."
