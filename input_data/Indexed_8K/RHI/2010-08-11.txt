Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2010, Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010 and Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 (collectively, the "SEC Filings") contained disclosures regarding two lawsuits against the Company filed in the California Superior Court: one by Plaintiff Mark Laffitte on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers; and one filed by Plaintiff Van Williamson on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers. As previously reported, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations and has vigorously defended against each litigation. At this stage of these cases, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from these proceedings, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the financial statements in the SEC Filings. As disclosed in the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2010, these cases were set for mediation on August 10, 2010. The mediation was held on such date but no resolution was reached.
The Company's SEC Filings contained disclosures regarding a case filed by Donald Green (who, as disclosed in the SEC Filings, died in 2009) for which no class has been certified. The Company believes that this matter is not currently a material pending legal proceeding and does not presently intend to make disclosures regarding this case in future Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
