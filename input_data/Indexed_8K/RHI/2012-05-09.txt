Effective May 9, 2012, Harold M. Messmer Jr., the Chief Executive Officer of Robert Half International Inc. (the "Company"), waived the vesting on and forfeited 41,891 shares of his earned but unvested 2011 long-term equity incentive award having an approximate grant date fair market value of $1.4 million reducing his total compensation reported for 2011 from $9,991,022 to $8,591,025. Mr. Messmer also agreed to reduce his target direct compensation for 2012 by $1.4 million such that his target compensation is approximately equal to his reduced total direct compensation for 2011. This results in a total pay reduction over the two years of $2.8 million. In addition, on May 9, 2012, all of the executive officers of the Company agreed to waive their rights under their existing arrangements to "single-trigger" change in control accelerated vesting and any future excise tax restoration payment.
Finally, the Company also entered into amended agreements with each of Mr. Messmer, M. Keith Waddell, Paul F. Gentzkow, Robert W. Glass, Michael C. Buckley and Steven Karel to further revise the performance-based long-term equity incentive awards granted in February 2011 and April 2012 as follows:
The vesting of the 2011 and 2012 long-term equity incentive awards are dependent upon the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies that comprise the S&P 500 Index for the period commencing on May 6, 2012 and ending on December 31, 2014. The agreements have been amended so that if the Company's relative total shareholder return is at or below the 35
th
percentile (previously it was the 25
th
percentile), then 50% (previously it was 25%) of the total shares subject to each equity award will be forfeited. If the Company's relative total shareholder return is at or above the 50
th
percentile, then no shares will be forfeited. If the Company's relative total shareholder return is between the 35
th
and 50
th
percentile, the number of shares forfeited will be determined based on linear interpolation. For example, if the Company's relative TSR is at the 40
th
percentile, then 33.3% of the total shares shall be forfeited.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
