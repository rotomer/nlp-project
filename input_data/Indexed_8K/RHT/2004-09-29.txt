Exhibit 99.1 Red Hat Announces Stock Repurchase Program RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 29, 2004--Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ: RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. "We believe, that based on current market prices, our stock is undervalued and that it is in the best interest of our shareholders for us to acquire shares in the open market. In addition, our repurchase program will help to offset dilution associated with our employee stock plans," said Matthew Szulik, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The timing and the amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with its stock plans and for other corporate purposes. The repurchase program will be funded using the Company's working capital. As of August 31, 2004, the Company had cash and investments in debt secuirties of approximately $997.7 million.
