(NASDAQ: RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2005.

For the full fiscal year 2005, enterprise subscription revenue was $147.4 million, or a 120% year-over-year increase. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company reported net income of $11.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 grew 200% on a year-over-year basis and were in-line with the prior quarter. For the full fiscal year, the company reported net income of $45.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, up from $0.07 per diluted share a year ago. The company generated $30.6 million in cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

After investing $54.8 million to repurchase stock during the quarter, cash and investments totaled $929 million as of February 28, 2005.

At the end of fiscal 2005, the company's total deferred revenue balance was $137.3 million, an increase of 86% on a year-over-year basis. "We are very pleased with the strong momentum of the Linux market place, and our business in particular," commented Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. "Based on publicly available information, we believe our enterprise subscription revenue run rate is more than six times that of the number two Linux provider, and over the past year we have expanded our market leadership position across the globe. A number of leading industry analysts believe that Linux will continue to be the fastest growing operating system over the next 3-5 years and we remain confident in our ability to compete." Charlie Peters also stated "We were very pleased with the company's revenue and bookings performance during the quarter. Heading into fiscal 2006, we feel optimistic about our business opportunity based on the strength of the market and our competitive position, and the growing visibility of our recurring revenue model. Finally, our confidence in the future cash flow capabilities of the company is evidenced by the expansion of our share repurchase program, which was separately announced today." Other highlights from the fourth quarter include: -- For the first time in its history, Red Hat sold to over 10,000 customers in a single quarter, and sold a record 175,000 new and renewed subscriptions. -- During the quarter, Red Hat was rated the number one value and reliability provider of all technology vendors in a survey of over 1,000 CIOs and IT executives conducted by Ziff Davis. -- Channel partner contribution continued to increase, with the percentage of business coming from the indirect channel growing to 56% of orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, up from 51% in the prior quarter and 43% in the first quarter of the fiscal year. -- Significant investments in international operations culminated in bookings from international operations growing more than 60% year-over-year. -- The number of software and hardware applications and platforms supporting Red Hat Enterprise Linux exceeded 1,800 at the end of fiscal 2005, an increase of over 80% compared to the end of the prior fiscal year. -- The company shipped Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 during the quarter, representing a major upgrade to the company's flagship offering and setting the standard for enterprise ready Linux platforms.

Exhibit 99.2 Red Hat Announces Expansion of Stock Repurchase Program and Authorizes Debenture Repurchase Program RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 31, 2005--Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the expansion of its previously announced common stock repurchase program. Under the expanded program, the Company is authorized to repurchase in aggregate up to $250 million of the Company's common stock. Based on the previously announced common stock repurchase program, Red Hat has already repurchased approximately $100 million of the expanded $250 million authorization. The Company also announced that its Board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company's 0.5% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2024. Repurchases of common stock and Convertible Debentures may be effected from time to time, either on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as appropriate and applicable. "We believe it is in the best interest of our shareholders for the Company to engage in this repurchase program. In addition, the repurchase program will help to offset dilution associated with our employee stock plans and our Convertible Debentures," said Charles Peters, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. The timing and the amount of any repurchased common stock and any Convertible Debentures will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors.

The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased common stock will be available for use in connection with its stock plans and for other corporate purposes. All Convertible Debentures will be retired and canceled. The repurchase program will be funded using the Company's working capital. As of February 28, 2005, the Company had cash and investments in debt securities of approximately $929 million.
