Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
2006 Performance Compensation Plan
On June 1, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat" or the "Company") approved, subject to stockholder approval, the 2006 Performance Compensation Plan (the "Performance Plan"). On August 17, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the Performance Plan by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting at the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The summary of the Performance Plan below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Performance Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The purpose of the Performance Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders and assist the Company in attracting and retaining executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who, because of the extent of their responsibilities can make significant contributions to the Company's success by their ability, industry, loyalty and services, by providing incentives and financial rewards to such executive officers. If certain requirements are satisfied, bonuses awarded under the Performance Plan to covered employees will qualify as deductible "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Purpose.
Participants in the Performance Plan ("Participants") are the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who are chosen solely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"). The Company may also pay discretionary bonuses, or other types of compensation, outside of the Performance Plan.
Eligibility.
All awards will be paid in cash or, to the extent provided in such plan, share awards under a stockholder-approved stock plan of the Company. Payment to each Participant will be made no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the fiscal year of the Company in which the applicable performance period ends. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of an award that would otherwise be delivered to a Participant under the Performance Plan.
Awards.
No Participant in the Performance Plan may be granted performance awards that are denominated in shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") in any 12-month period with respect to more than 1,000,000 shares. In addition to the foregoing, the maximum dollar value payable to any Participant in the Performance Plan in any 12-month period with respect to performance awards that are valued in cash or property other than shares is $10,000,000.
Maximum Award.
The Performance Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee shall be responsible for the general administration and interpretation of the Performance Plan and for carrying out its provisions. The Compensation Committee has the authority to select persons to receive awards from among the eligible employees and set the terms and conditions of each award consistent with the terms of the Performance Plan. The Compensation Committee may establish rules and policies for administration of the Performance Plan and adopt one or more forms of agreement to evidence awards made under the Performance Plan. The Compensation Committee interprets the Performance Plan and any agreement used under the Performance Plan, and all determinations of the Compensation Committee that are not inconsistent with the Performance Plan will be final and binding on all persons.
Administration.
Under the Performance Plan, Participants will be eligible to receive awards based upon the attainment and certification of certain performance goals established by the Compensation Committee over the applicable performance period. The performance goals that may be selected by the Compensation Committee include one or more of the following: revenue growth, net revenues, gross margins, net margins, operating income, pre-tax income, after-tax income, net income, net earnings, earning per share (basic and diluted), earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, return on invested capital, return on equity, return on assets, economic value added (or an equivalent metric), cash flow from operations, cash flow per share, changes in deferred revenues, share price performance, total shareholder return, improvement in or attainment of expense levels, improvement in or attainment of working capital levels, attainment of strategic and operational initiatives, market share, gross profits, comparisons with various stock market indices, and/or implementation, completion or attainment of measurable objectives with respect to research, development, products or projects. Performance goals may vary by Participant and award and also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of a subsidiary, division or business unit of the Company for or within which the Participant is primarily employed, or based upon the relative performance of other companies, or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies.
Determination of Awards.
The Compensation Committee may provide that attainment of a performance goal shall be measured by adjusting the evaluation of performance as follows: to eliminate the effects of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and other unusual or non-recurring items, as well as the cumulative effect of accounting changes, in each case as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or identified in the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussion and analysis or other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate any award that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the Performance Plan.
All awards made pursuant to the Performance Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company, or a subsidiary, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to awards under the Performance Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or a subsidiary except as may be determined by the Compensation Committee or by the Board.
Nature of Payments.
Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan
On June 1, 2006 the Board approved, subject to stockholder approval, an Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Amended Plan"). On August 17, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the Amended Plan by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting at the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The summary of the Amended Plan below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The purpose of the Amended Plan is to allow the Company's employees, consultants, advisors and non-employee members of the Board who are selected to receive awards under the Amended Plan the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company.
Purpose.
. A total of 13,000,000 shares of Common Stock, plus any shares previously authorized and available for issuance under the Acquired Plans (as defined in the Amended Plan) and that may become available for issuance under the Acquired Plans, is reserved for issuance under the Amended Plan, subject to adjustment in certain events, including in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, or other similar change in the Common Stock or capital structure of the Company. The Amended Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Code, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards described below. Awards under the Amended Plan may be either performance-based and designed to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code, or discretionary. Subject to the Amended Plan limits, the Compensation Committee has the discretionary authority to determine the size of an award and whether it is intended to be performance-based.
Awards
. Optionees receive the right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock at a specified exercise price and subject to the terms and conditions as are specified in the option grant. The exercise price of stock options granted under the Amended Plan may not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant, and no stock option will be exercisable more than seven years after the date it is granted, except in the event of the optionee's death or disability. The Compensation Committee will determine at the time of grant when each stock option becomes exercisable, with certain minimums. Payment of the exercise price of a stock option may be in cash, Common Stock owned by the participant, withholding of shares otherwise issuable with the consent of the Compensation Committee, other consideration permitted by the Compensation Committee or by a combination of the foregoing.
Stock Options
. Restricted stock awards entitle recipients to acquire shares of Common Stock, subject to forfeiture of all or part of such shares by the recipient in the event that the conditions specified in the applicable award are not satisfied prior to the end of the applicable restriction period established in such award. Restricted stock unit awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of Common Stock to be delivered in the future subject to such terms and conditions on the delivery of the shares as the Compensation Committee may determine. Any awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units which vest on the basis of a participant's continuous active service with Red Hat or a related entity will not provide for vesting which, subject to certain exceptions, is any more rapid than one third of the award vesting after one year and the remainder of the award vesting pro rata over the following two years. Any awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units which provide for vesting upon the attainment of performance goals shall provide for a performance period of at least 12 months.
Restricted Stock
. A stock appreciation right ("SAR") is an award entitling the holder on exercise to receive, at the election of the Company, either cash or Common Stock in an amount determined in whole or in part by reference to the appreciation in the fair market value of a share of Common Stock from the date of grant until the date of exercise. SARs may be granted without regard to any option or other award under the Amended Plan or in conjunction with all or part of any option granted under the Amended Plan.
Stock Appreciation Rights
. Under the Amended Plan, the Compensation Committee has the right to grant other awards of Common Stock or awards otherwise based upon Common Stock or other property, including without limitation performance awards that may be paid in cash, Common Stock, other property or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee at the time of payment.
Other Stock-Based Awards
 
. In the event of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar event affecting the Common Stock, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, in addition to any provisions contained in the terms of a grant, adjust the number and kind of shares granted under the Amended Plan, the number and kind of shares subject to awards and the exercise price of outstanding stock options.
Adjustments
. Except as authorized by the Compensation Committee or the prior approval of the Company's stockholders, no awards and no shares of Common Stock that have not been issued or to which any applicable restriction has not lapsed may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or a qualified domestic relations order. The Compensation Committee may provide in certain types of award for transfer to or for the benefit of the participant's immediate family member, a family trust or any other entity established for the benefit of the participant or his or her immediate family member.
Transferability
. If provided in an award agreement, stock options and other awards granted to employees, non-employee directors, advisors and consultants under the Amended Plan may become exercisable upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the Amended Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, terms and conditions as may be set forth in an award agreement or determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion may supercede the Amended Plan.
Change in Control
. The Compensation Committee shall determine the period of time for which any Awards under the Amended Plan will continue to be exercisable and the terms of exercise upon termination of a participant's employment or service with the Company or its affiliate.
Termination of Employment
. The Amended Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee or such other committee appointed by the Board. The Compensation Committee will select the employees of the Company and other persons who shall receive awards, determine the number of shares covered thereby, and establish the terms, conditions and other provisions of the grants. The Compensation Committee may interpret the Amended Plan and establish, amend and rescind any rules relating to the Amended Plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more directors or officers the right under an award agreement to grant, cancel or suspend awards to employees who are not directors or officers of the Company.
Administration
. The Board may at any time terminate, amend or suspend the Amended Plan as it deems advisable, subject to any requirement for stockholder approval imposed by applicable law, including the rules and regulations of NASDAQ (or any stock exchange or quotation system on which the Company's shares are then listed or quoted). In addition, no action may be taken by the Board (except those described earlier under the heading "Adjustments") without the approval of the stockholders if the amendment would (a) increase the number of shares that may be the subject of awards under the Amended Plan, (b) expand the types of awards available under the Amended Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Amended Plan, (d) amend the provision of the Plan that prohibits re-pricing of options, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any option beyond seven years or (f) amend any provision establishing limitations on grants to individual participants.

Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the provisions of this Plan shall be administered and interpreted in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code to ensure the deductibility by the Company of the payment of Awards.

Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
The Company or an Affiliate shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant, net of any applicable federal, state and local taxes required to be paid or withheld. The Company or an Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages, Awards or other amounts otherwise payable to such Participant such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Participant to pay such withholding taxes.

Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of an Award hereunder shall confer upon any Participant the right to continue in the employment of the Company or an Affiliate or affect any right that the Company or an Affiliate may have to terminate the employment of (or to demote or to exclude from future Awards under the Plan) any such Participant at any time for any reason. Except as specifically provided by the Committee, the Company shall not be liable for the loss of

existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of the termination of employment of any Participant. No Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.
 
All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company or an Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or an Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
5.5.
Nature of Payments.
 
Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
5.6.
Other Plans.
 
If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.
5.7.
Severability.
 
As used in the Plan, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
5.8.
Construction.
 
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation and deferred compensation if permitted by the Committee. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
5.9.
Unfunded Status of the Plan.
 
The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to principles of conflict of laws that might result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, and shall be construed accordingly.
5.10.
Governing Law.
 
. The Plan shall be effective on the date of the approval of the Plan by the holders of the then outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally and voting at a duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company. The Plan shall be null and void and of no effect if the foregoing condition is not fulfilled.

All Options granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be evidenced by a written Award Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.

Any individual who is granted an Option pursuant to this Section 5 may hold more than one Option granted pursuant to the Plan at the same time.
 
5.4. Option Price. Other than in connection with Substitute Awards, the option price per each Share purchasable under any Option granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the date of grant of such Option.

5.5. Option Period. The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided that no Option shall, except in the event of death or disability, be exercisable after (i) with respect to Options granted prior to the Amendment Effective Date, the expiration of ten years from the date the Option is granted or (ii) with respect to Options granted on and after the Amendment Effective Date, the expiration of seven years from the date the Option is granted.

Except with respect to Substitute Awards and grants to Directors or in other limited situations as determined by the Committee (including termination of employment, a Change in Control referred to in Section 11, grants to new hires to replace forfeited compensation, grants representing payment of earned Performance Awards or other incentive compensation), Options subject solely to future service requirements shall have a vesting period of not less than one year from date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options granted under the Plan in lieu of earned, but unpaid, cash compensation shall not be subject to this Section 5.6.
 
5.7. Exercise of Options. Vested Options granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the Participant (or by the Participant's executors, administrators, guardian or legal representative, as may be provided in an Award
 
Agreement) as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby, by the giving of written, telephonic, or electronic notice of exercise to the Company or its designated agent pursuant to rules and procedures established by the Committee for this purpose, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment of the full purchase price for the Shares being purchased. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, full payment of such purchase price shall be made at the time of exercise and shall be made (a) in cash or cash equivalents (including certified check or bank check or wire transfer of immediately available funds), (b) by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period specified by the Committee for the purposes of avoiding accounting charges against the Company's earnings, as applicable), (c) with the consent of the Committee, by delivery of other consideration (including, where permitted by law and the Committee, other Awards) having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the total purchase price, (d) with the consent of the Committee, by withholding Shares otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the Option, (e) through any other method specified in an Award Agreement; (f) as provided by the Committee, cashless exercises as permitted under the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T, subject to applicable securities law restrictions, or (g) any combination of any of the foregoing. The notice of exercise, accompanied by such payment, shall be delivered to the Company at its principal business office or such other office as the Committee may from time to time direct, and shall be in such form, containing such further provisions consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee may from time to time prescribe. In no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance. Except under certain circumstances contemplated by Section 11 or as may be set forth in an Award Agreement with respect to death or disability of a Participant, Options will not be exercisable before the expiration of one year from the date the Option is granted.
 
5.8. Form of Settlement. In its sole discretion, the Committee may provide, at the time of grant, that the Shares to be issued upon an Option's exercise shall be in the form of Restricted Stock or other similar securities, or may reserve the right so to provide after the time of grant.
 
6. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
6.1. Grant and Exercise. The Committee may provide Stock Appreciation Rights alone or in tandem with other Awards (including Options), in each case upon such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee may establish. The provisions of Stock Appreciation Rights need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
(a) Stock Appreciation Rights granted without regard to any Option or other Award (a "Freestanding Stock Appreciation Right") shall generally have the same terms and conditions as Options, including (i) an exercise price not less than Fair Market Value on the date of grant (except in the case of Substitute Awards or in connection with an adjustment provided in Section 12.2) (ii) a term not greater than seven years, and (iii) a vesting schedule not less than one year from the date of grant, except for Substitute Awards or under certain circumstances contemplated by Section 11 or as may be set forth in an Award Agreement with respect to death or disability of a Participant. Upon the exercise of a Freestanding Stock Appreciation Right, the holder shall have the right to receive the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise or such other amount as the Committee shall so determine at any time during a specified period before the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the right on the date of grant.
 
(b) Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in conjunction with all or part of any Option granted under the Plan (a "Tandem Stock Appreciation Right"). Any Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be granted at the same time as the related Option is granted or at any time thereafter before exercise or expiration of such Option if there would be no adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. Upon the exercise of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right, the holder shall have the right to receive (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise or such other amount as the Committee shall so determine at any time during a specified period before the date of exercise over (ii) the related Option exercise price. Any Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised only when the related
 
Option would be exercisable and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the related Option exceeds the option price at which Shares can be acquired pursuant to the Option. Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon and to the extent of the termination or exercise of the related Option; provided that, unless the Committee otherwise determines at or after the time of grant, a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right granted with respect to less than the full number of Shares covered by a related Option shall not terminate until the number of Shares then exercisable under such Option equals the number of Shares to which the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right applies. Any Option related to a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall no longer be exercisable to the extent the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised.
 
(c) The Committee may impose such terms and conditions on Stock Appreciation Rights granted in conjunction with any Award (other than an Option) as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.
 
(d) The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether payment upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, shall be made in cash, in whole Shares or other property, or any combination thereof. If payment will be made in Shares, the number of Shares shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise. If the Committee elects to make full payment in Shares, no fractional Shares shall be issued and cash payments shall be made in lieu of fractional Shares. The Committee shall have sole discretion as to the timing of any payment made in cash or Shares, or a combination thereof, upon exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights. Payment may be made in a lump sum, in annual installments or may be otherwise deferred; and the Committee shall have sole discretion to determine whether any deferred payments may bear amounts equivalent to interest or cash dividends.
 
(e) Other than pursuant to Section 12.2, the Committee shall not be permitted to (i) lower the exercise price per Share of a Stock Appreciation Right after it is granted, (ii) cancel a Stock Appreciation Right when the exercise price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange for another Award (other than in connection with Substitute Awards), and (iii) take any other action with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right that may be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, without shareholder approval.

A Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be subject to restrictions imposed by the Committee covering a period of time specified by the Committee (the "Restriction Period"). The provisions of Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. The Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether any consideration (other than services) is to be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the issuance of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.

Beginning on the date of grant of the Restricted Stock Award and subject to execution of the Award Agreement, the Participant shall become a shareholder of the Company with respect to all Shares subject to the Award Agreement and shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote such Shares and the right to receive distributions made with respect to such Shares. A Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not possess voting rights with respect to such Award. Any Shares or any other property (other than cash) distributed as a dividend, Dividend Equivalent or otherwise with respect to any Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award as to which the restrictions have not yet lapsed shall be subject to the same restrictions as such Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award.
 
7.4. Minimum Vesting Period. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards subject solely to future service requirements shall have a Restriction Period of not less than three years from date of grant (but permitting vesting of up to one-third of the Award after one year with the remainder vesting on a pro-rata basis over the remainder of the Restriction Period). Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards that are: (a) granted after the Amendment Effective Date, and (b) subject in whole or in part to performance based vesting requirements, shall have a Restriction Period of not less than one year. The Committee may, in its discretion either at the time of grant or at some later date, waive the minimum vesting periods imposed collectively by this Section 7.4 and Section 8.2 below with respect to an aggregate of 5% of the total shares authorized for issuance under this Plan in certain limited circumstances determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

Other Awards of Shares and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, Shares or other property ("Other Stock-Based Awards") may be granted hereunder to Participants, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan, and such Other Stock-Based Awards shall also be available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan. Other Stock-Based Awards shall be paid only in Shares. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees and Directors to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be made, the number of Shares to be granted pursuant to such Awards, and all other conditions of the Awards. The provisions of Other Stock-Based Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
8.2. Minimum Vesting Period. Other Stock-Based Awards subject solely to future service requirements shall have a Restriction Period of not less than three years from date of grant (but permitting vesting of up to one-third of the Award after one year with the remainder vesting on a pro-rata basis over the remainder of the Restriction Period). Other Stock-Based Awards that are: (a) granted after the Amendment Effective Date, and (b) subject in whole or in part to performance based vesting requirements, shall have a Restriction Period of not less than one year. Other Stock-Based Awards representing solely the right to receive shares of Common Stock at some future date specified by the Committee (the "Deferral Period") shall have a Deferral Period of not less than three years from the date of grant. The Committee may, in its discretion either at the time of grant or at some later date, waive the minimum vesting periods imposed collectively by this Section 8.2 and Section 7.4 above with respect to an aggregate of 5% of the total shares authorized for issuance under this Plan in certain limited circumstances determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Other Stock-Based Awards granted under the Plan in lieu of previously earned, but unpaid, cash compensation shall not be subject to this Section 8.2.
 
8.3. Terms and Conditions. Shares (including securities convertible into Shares) subject to Awards granted under this Section 8 may be issued for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law. Shares (including securities convertible into Shares) purchased pursuant to a purchase right awarded under this Section 8 shall be purchased for such consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.
 
9. PERFORMANCE AWARDS
 
Terms of Performance Awards. Performance Awards may be issued hereunder to Participants, for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan. The performance criteria to be achieved during any performance period and the length of the performance period shall be determined by the Committee upon the grant of each Performance Award; provided, however, that a performance period shall not be shorter than 12
 
months nor longer than five years. Except as provided in Section 11 or as may be provided in an Award Agreement, Performance Awards will be distributed only after the end of the relevant performance period. Performance Awards may be paid in cash, Shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment. The performance goals to be achieved for each performance period shall be conclusively determined by the Committee and may be based upon the criteria set forth in Section 10. The amount of the Award to be distributed shall be conclusively determined by the Committee. Performance Awards may be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the performance period or, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, on a deferred basis. Performance Awards (other than Options, Freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights or Option/Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights) designed to satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code shall be subject to this Plan and the Company's 2006 Performance Compensation Plan (or any successor plan thereto).
 
10. CODE SECTION 162(m) PROVISIONS

Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12.2, no Participant may be granted (i) Options, Freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights, or Option/Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights during any 12-month period with respect to more than two million (2,000,000) Shares or (ii) Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance Awards and/or Other Stock-Based Awards that are denominated in Shares in any 12-month period with respect to more than one million (1,000,000) Shares (the "Limitations"). In addition to the foregoing, the maximum dollar value payable to any Participant in any 12-month period with respect to Performance Awards that are valued with reference to property other than Shares is $10,000,000. If an Award is cancelled, the cancelled Award shall continue to be counted toward the applicable Limitations. The per-Participant limit described in this Section 10 shall be construed and applied consistently with Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder.
 
11. CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS
 
11.1. Impact of Change in Control on Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, The terms of any Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Award that, upon a "Change in Control" of the Company (as that term may be defined therein), (a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the date of the Change in Control shall become exercisable in full or part, (b) restrictions and deferral limitations on Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards lapse and the Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards become free of all restrictions and limitations and become vested, and (c) the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any Other Stock-Based Awards or any other Awards shall lapse, and such Other Stock-Based Awards or such other Awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested in full or part and transferable to the full extent of the original grant, subject in each case to any terms and conditions contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award, including but not limited to a condition that such treatment will apply only if the Participant remains employed on the effective date of the Change in Control or has incurred an involuntary termination of employment without cause on account of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, within a period of up to 3 months prior to the effective date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, each Option and Stock Appreciation Right outstanding shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the Participant, and such Participant shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of such Share immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control over the exercise price per share of such Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right; such amount to be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of stock or property (including the stock or property, if any, payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its discretion, shall determine.
 
11.2. Assumption of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, and Other Stock-Based Awards Upon Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, the successor company may assume or substitute for an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award. For the purposes of this Section 11.2, an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award shall be considered assumed or substituted for if following the Change in Control the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in the transaction constituting a Change in Control by holders of Shares for each Share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the transaction constituting a Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor company, the Committee may, with the consent of the successor company, provide that the consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award, for each Share subject thereto, will be solely common stock of the successor company substantially equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Shares in the transaction constituting a Change in Control. The determination of such substantial equality of value of consideration shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion and its determination shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in an Award Agreement, in the event of an involuntary termination of a Participant's employment without cause in such successor company within the period of up to 24 months following such Change in Control, each Award held by such Participant at the time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated as described in Sections 11.1 above.
 
11.3. Impact of Change in Control on Performance Awards. The terms of any Performance Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Performance Award that, upon a Change in Control of the Company (as that term may be defined therein),
 
(a) a pro rata portion of Performance Awards shall be considered to be earned and payable based on the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the date of the Change in Control and based on performance to such date, or if performance to such date is not determinable, based on target performance, and
 
(b) the remaining portion of Performance Awards shall be assumed, converted or replaced with restricted stock in the successor company's shares (if the Award is valued by reference to a designated number of Shares) or restricted deferred compensation (for other Awards) based on the portion of the performance period not yet completed and based on target performance. Such assumed, converted or replaced portion of the Performance Award shall be restricted for the remainder of the performance period or vesting period, as applicable. If the successor company does not assume, convert or replace the remaining portion of the Performance Award as described in this Section 11.3(b), the full award shall be considered earned and payable upon consummation of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Award Agreement for a Performance Award may provide that in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's employment with the Company or any Affiliate without cause on account of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, within a period of up to 3 months prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and/or in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's employment without cause in such successor company within the period of up to 24 months following such Change in Control, the vesting of the restricted stock or restricted deferred compensation, as applicable, held by such Participant at the time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated.
 
12. GENERALLY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS
 
12.1. Amendment and Modification of the Plan. The Board may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for shareholder approval imposed by
 
applicable law, including the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or any rule or regulation of any stock exchange or quotation system on which Shares are listed or quoted; provided that the Board may not amend the Plan in any manner that would result in noncompliance with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act; and further provided that the Board may not, without the approval of the Company's shareholders, amend the Plan to (a) increase the number of Shares that may be the subject of Awards under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 12.2), (b) expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) effect an amendment for which shareholder approval is required under Section 422 of the Code, (e) amend any provision of Sections 5.4, 6.1(a)(i) or 6.1(e), (f) increase the maximum permissible term of any Option specified by Section 5.5, or (g) amend any provision of Section 10. In addition, no amendments to, or termination of, the Plan shall in any way materially impair the rights of a Participant under any Award previously granted without such Participant's consent.
 
12.2. Adjustments. In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution (whether in cash, shares or other property), stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar transaction or other change in corporate structure affecting the Shares or the value thereof, such adjustments and other substitutions shall be made to the Plan and to Awards as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equitable or appropriate, including such adjustments in the aggregate number, class and kind of securities that may be delivered under the Plan and, in the aggregate or to any one Participant, in the number, class, kind and option or exercise price of securities subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Plan (including, if the Committee deems appropriate, the substitution of similar options to purchase the shares of, or other awards denominated in the shares of, another company) as the Committee may determine to be appropriate in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number.
 
12.3. Transferability of Awards. Awards shall not, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and voting at a duly constituted meeting of the shareholders of the Company, be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the person to whom they are granted, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, other than in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the life of the Participant, shall be exercisable only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative; provided, however, that the Committee may permit or provide in an Award, other than an Incentive Stock Option for the transfer of the Award by the Participant to or for the benefit of any immediate family member, family trust or other entity established for the benefit of the Participant and/or an immediate family member thereof if, with respect to such proposed transferee, the Company would be eligible to use a Form S-8 for the registration of the sale of the Shares subject to such Award under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to recognize any such transfer until such time as the Participant and such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Company confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Award. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in the context, shall include references to authorized transferees.
 
12.4. Termination of Employment. The Committee shall determine and set forth in each Award Agreement whether any Awards granted in such Award Agreement will continue to be exercisable, and the terms of such exercise, on and after the date that a Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Company or any Affiliate (including as a Director), whether by reason of death, disability, voluntary or involuntary termination of employment or services, or otherwise. The date of termination of a Participant's employment or services will be determined by the Committee, which determination will be final.
 
12.5. Deferral; Dividend Equivalents. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures pursuant to which the payment of any Award may be deferred. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the recipient of an Award (including any deferred Award) may, if so determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, stock or other property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to cash, stock or other property dividends on Shares ("Dividend Equivalents") with respect
 
to the number of Shares covered by the Award, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested.
 
12.6. Past Performance. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may issue fully vested Awards in lieu of previously earned, but unpaid, cash compensation.
 
13. MISCELLANEOUS
 
13.1. Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant (any such person, a "Payee") net of any applicable Federal, State and local taxes required to be paid or withheld as a result of (a) the grant of any Award, (b) the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (c) the delivery of Shares or cash, (d) the lapse of any restrictions in connection with any Award or (e) any other event occurring pursuant to the Plan. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages or other amounts otherwise payable to such Payee such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Payee to pay such withholding taxes. If the Payee shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Payee or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures for election by Participants to satisfy such obligation for the payment of such taxes by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period to avoid accounting charges against the Company's earnings), or by directing the Company to retain Shares (up to the employee's minimum required tax withholding rate) otherwise deliverable in connection with the Award.
 
13.2. Right of Discharge Reserved; Claims to Awards. Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of an Award hereunder shall confer upon any Employee or Director the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate or affect any right that the Company or any Affiliate may have to terminate the employment or service of (or to demote or to exclude from future Awards under the Plan) any such Employee or Director at any time for any reason. Except as specifically provided by the Committee, the Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of termination of an employment or other relationship. No Employee or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Participants under the Plan.
 
13.3. Prospective Recipient. The prospective recipient of any Award under the Plan shall not, with respect to such Award, be deemed to have become a Participant, or to have any rights with respect to such Award, until and unless such recipient shall have executed an agreement or other instrument evidencing the Award and delivered a copy thereof to the Company, and otherwise complied with the then applicable terms and conditions.
 
13.4. Cancellation of Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all outstanding Awards granted to any Participant shall be canceled if the Participant, without the consent of the Company, while employed by the Company or any Affiliate or after termination of such employment or service, establishes a relationship with a competitor of the Company.
 
13.5. Stop Transfer Orders. All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under
 
the Plan or make any other distributions or the benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
 
13.6. Nature of Payments. All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or any Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
 
13.7. Other Plans. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
13.8. Severability. If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.
 
13.9. Construction. All references in the Plan to "Section or Sections" are intended to refer to the Section or Sections, as the case may be, of the Plan. As used in the Plan, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
 
13.10. Unfunded Status of the Plan. The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver the Shares or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards hereunder; provided, however, that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.
 
13.11. Governing Law. The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.
 
13.12. Effective Date of Plan; Termination of Plan. The Plan became effective on September 21, 2004, the date that the Plan was first approved by the shareholders of the Company. Awards may be granted under the Plan at any time and from time to time on or prior to September 21, 2014, on which date the Plan will expire except as to Awards then outstanding under the Plan. Such outstanding Awards shall remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired.
 
13.13. Foreign Employees. Awards may be granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Awards to Employees employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to recognize differences in local law or tax policy. The Committee also may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of Awards in order to minimize the Company's obligation with respect to tax equalization for Employees on assignments outside their home country. The Committee may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of this Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose, and the Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as this Plan.
 
13.14. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. This Plan is intended to comply and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Award shall be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations or other guidance issued with respect thereto, except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Any provision of this Plan that would cause the grant of an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall be amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code on a timely basis, which may be made on a retroactive basis, in accordance with regulations and other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee.
 
13.15. Captions. The captions in the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to narrow, limit or affect the substance or interpretation of the provisions contained herein.
