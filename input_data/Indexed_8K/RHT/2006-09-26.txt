Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition On September 26, 2006, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2006. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006 and August 31, 2005. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on: o the impact of share-based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R") versus share-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB 25"); and o the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of APB 25, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards. The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP share-based expense of $8.3 million and $15.9 million for the three and six months ended August 31, 2006, respectively versus non-GAAP, or what would have been reported had we continued reporting share-based compensation under the provisions of APB 25, of $0.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. During the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $6.5 million and $14.6 million respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 37%. We currently have approximately $450 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5% for the foreseeable future. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in adjusted income tax expense for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006 of $1.2 million and $2.7 million respectively. Likewise, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $1.9 million and $3.2 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2005 was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5%, resulting in adjusted income tax expenses of $0.9 million and $1.6 million for those respective periods.
Management believes that the adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance. The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1 Red Hat Reports Fiscal 2007 Second Quarter Results -- 52% revenue growth -- 6th consecutive quarter adding more than 10,000 new customers -- 18th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in total revenue RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 26, 2006--Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2007 second quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $99.7 million, an increase of 52% from the year-ago quarter and 19% from the prior quarter. Subscription revenue was $84.9 million, up 56% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. JBoss-related revenue of $7 million was at the top of management's previously provided guidance. Net income for the quarter was $11.0 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $16.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the second quarter of the last fiscal year. Due to differences in the accounting treatment for taxes and stock compensation expense between fiscal 2006 and 2007, net income is not directly comparable between these periods. After adjusting for these accounting differences, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $23.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $17.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter of the last fiscal year. At quarter end, the company's total deferred revenue balance was $284.1 million, an increase of $29.4 million, or 12% when compared to the end of the last fiscal quarter. Other highlights from the quarter included: -- Quarterly gross margin improved to 84% from 82% in the year-ago period. -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux OEM revenue grew 90% year-over-year. -- Total cash and investments as of August 31, 2006 were $1.0 billion. "The second quarter was one of intense focus on integrating our recent acquisitions in Argentina, Brazil, India and, of course, JBoss," stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "We are pleased with the pace and progress of our integration work and believe that results in subsequent quarters will benefit from the investments in employee time and expense made in Q2. Revenue grew nicely and we expect the recent introduction of the Red Hat Application Stack will help continue that trend. We expect operating results and cash flow will improve in the second half of fiscal 2007 since much of the heavy integration work is behind us already." "Our better than expected revenue and earnings per share speak to the ongoing demand for open source solutions that we continue to see worldwide," stated Dion Cornett, Vice President of Investor Relations. "Moreover, the particular strength we saw in hardware OEM revenue growth stands in stark contrast to the reported weakness experienced by server suppliers this past quarter. We feel this difference highlights the value Red Hat is able to provide that extends beyond mere box counts."
