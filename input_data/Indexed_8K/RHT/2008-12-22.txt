On December 22, 2008, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2008. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R");
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007,  include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $12.3 million and $33.7 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2008, and $9.5 million and $26.4 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2007, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of  profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.1 million and $12.7 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2008, and $3.3 million and $9.8 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2007, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
During the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $9.2 million and $33.8 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 35.0%. We currently have approximately $111 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5.0% through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008 of $2.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively.  In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.0 million and $34.9 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2007, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5.0%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $2.3 million and $6.3 million for these periods.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method), the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Third Quarter Results
Revenue of $165.3 million, up 22% year over year and within guidance on a comparable currency basis
GAAP EPS of 12 cents, Non-GAAP EPS of 24 cents exceeds guidance
Operating Cash-flow of $59.1 million
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 22, 2008--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2009 third quarter ended November 30, 2008.
Total revenue for the quarter was $165.3 million, an increase of 22% from the year ago quarter and 1% from the prior quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $135.5 million, up 17% year-over-year and flat sequentially.
Foreign exchange rate changes during the quarter, as compared to the second quarter, reduced quarterly revenues and expenses by $6.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, resulting in a negative impact on operating income of $2.1 million. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $21.0 million, or a 12.7% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, non-GAAP operating income was $38.4 million, or a 23.2% operating margin, up 120 basis points from the prior quarter despite the strengthening US dollar and the Qumranet acquisition.
Net income for the quarter was $24.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with $20.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $48.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation, amortization and tax expense as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $42.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow totaled $59.1 million, compared to $59.6 million from the year ago quarter and $54.3 million from the prior quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $505.1 million, an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis and 2% sequentially. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of November 30, 2008 were $1.1 billion after retiring $285 million of convertible debentures and repurchasing 2 million shares of common stock.
Subsequent to these repurchases, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program with a capacity of up to $250 million.
Our solid financial results this quarter reflect our strong market position as the low cost, high value provider of infrastructure solutions, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. Purchasing decisions for IT have changed dramatically for CIOs. In this budget-constrained environment, IT professionals are adopting open source and more specifically Red Hat to save money and enhance their competitiveness.
"This was a strong quarter where we delivered better-than-expected operating income, net income and cash flow, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. While significant devaluations in most foreign currencies depressed our reported revenue, a combination of focused cost management and natural currency hedging enabled the company to deliver better-than-expected operating margin.
We also took advantage of unusual market conditions and repurchased some of our convertible bonds and common stock. This action reduced the diluted shares outstanding by approximately 11 million, or 6%, and produced a gain of $4.1 million, both improving earnings per share. Our balance sheet remains very strong.
Other highlights include the following:
Red Hat announced an agreement with Fujitsu to provide new Linux support services that are designed to provide quicker response times and extended support periods for mission-critical systems through the Red Hat Advanced Mission Critical Program. The Program combines the mainframe expertise of Fujitsu with the enterprise Linux expertise of Red Hat.
Red Hat Chairman Matthew Szulik was named Ernst & Young's Overall National Winner for Entrepreneur of the Year 2008 Award.
Red Hat continued to develop its capabilities and offerings in virtualization. Early in the quarter, Red Hat acquired Qumranet Inc. which accelerates the time to market to deliver an expanded virtualization solutions portfolio.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at . A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the live event will have ended.
