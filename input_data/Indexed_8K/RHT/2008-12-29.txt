Senior Management Severance Plan and Executive Agreements
On December 22, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "") approved a Senior Management Severance Plan (the ""), pursuant to which select Company employees, currently including all of the Company's named executive officers except its Chief Executive Officer, may become eligible to receive certain severance benefits. Participation in the Plan is limited to employees of the Company who:
Board
Company
Plan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent with the foregoing, each of the named executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer, will be eligible to participate in the Plan upon the execution of an Executive Agreement with the Company upon terms materially consistent with those described above and in substantially the form of the Executive Agreement attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The Plan Administrator may within its discretion remove any Plan participant from participation in the Plan at any time but any such removal will be effective no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the date on which such action was taken. If any Plan participant is so removed from participation in the Plan during the term of his employment with the Company, he will cease to be bound by the post-employment covenants of non-solicitation and non-competition under his applicable Executive Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, a Plan participant will be entitled to receive benefits under the Plan in the event that the Plan Administrator determines that:
 
 
 
A Plan participant qualifying for benefits under the Plan is entitled to receive the following benefits following termination of his employment with the Company:
 
 
 
 
The lump-sum payments generally will be paid within 75 days following the Plan participant's termination of employment, subject to delay in order to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, if the Plan participant does not execute the required release, he may be subject to recoupment by the Company for any incremental appreciation or gain obtained by exercising or disposing, or upon vesting, of portions of equity awards that vested after termination of his employment or that exercised during any extended exercise.
The foregoing summaries of the Plan and the form of Executive Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Plan and the form of Executive Agreement, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
See Exhibit Index attached hereto.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
The purpose of this Senior Management Severance Plan (the "Plan") is to provide financial assistance to any Participant (as defined in Section II, below) whose employment with Red Hat, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (the "Company") is terminated under the circumstances described herein.
 
Selected Company employees shall be eligible to participate in this Plan (as a "Participant") as long as they meet the requirements to be a Participant in this Section II.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination for Good Cause shall not have occurred unless (i) the Company gives written notice to the Participant of the Company's intention to terminate the Participant's employment within sixty (60) days after the Board of Directors has knowledge that an event constituting Good Cause has occurred, specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances constituting Good Cause and (ii) there shall have been delivered to the Participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board (excluding the Participant if the Participant is a member of the Board) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Participant and the Participant is given an opportunity, together with legal counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Participant has engaged the conduct described above and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination for Good Reason shall not have occurred unless the Participant gives written notice to the Company of the Participant's intention to terminate employment within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of the event constituting Good Reason, specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances constituting Good Reason, and the Company has failed within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to cure the circumstances constituting Good Reason and the Participant terminates employment within six (6) months of the end of such thirty (30) day period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Payment is due in cash or cash equivalents within ten (10) days after the Committee provides notice to a Participant that it is enforcing this Section. Any equity awards not already vested or exercised will then be immediately forfeited.
Payment will be calculated on a gross basis, without reduction for taxes or commissions. The Committee may, but is not required to, accept retransfer of shares in lieu of cash payments. This provision supplements and does not supersede the recoupment provision in Section 8(a) of the Agreement (relating to violations of restrictive covenants).
 
The Plan constitutes an unfunded severance benefits plan that is intended to be a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), subject to Part 4 and 5 of Title I of ERISA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may reduce the benefits under Section IV.A.1 (and the terms of Schedule A) by up to fifty percent (50%) without the foregoing twelve (12) month delay if the Committee determines that, as a result of a substantially adverse change in the Company's financial condition or in the results of the Company's operation (other than solely a decline in the price of the Company's common stock), it is in the Company's overall best interest to reduce the severance payments. The reduction can apply to any or all Participants. The Committee must make its determination in good faith and set out its conclusions and their basis in writing. Any reduction under this paragraph shall be treated as a reduction covered by Section 3(d) of the Agreement (relating to a reduction in the noncompetition period under the Agreement).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severance Payments (Section IV. A.1.)
The Severance Payment for any Participant under Section IV.A.1. shall equal the Participant's Base Salary
1
times the Multiplier.
