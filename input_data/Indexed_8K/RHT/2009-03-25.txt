Item 2.02.           Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 25, 2009, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and fiscal years ended February 28, 2009 and February 29, 2008. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
        the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R");
        the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
        the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and fiscal years ended February 28, 2009 and February 29, 2008 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $14.6 million and $48.3 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009 and $10.0 million and $36.5 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.9 million and $17.6 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, and $3.1 million and $13.0 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
During the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $9.0 million and $42.8 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 35.2%%. We currently have approximately $80.0 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5.0% for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009.  For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009 of $2.2 million and $9.4 million, respectively. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.9 million and $47.9 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5.0%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $2.4 million and $8.7 million for these periods.  
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) , the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates.  Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2009 Results
Annual revenue of $653 million, up 25% from prior year
Full year GAAP EPS of $0.39, non-GAAP EPS of $0.86
Annual Operating Cash-flow of $236 million
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 25, 2009--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009.
Total revenue for the quarter was $166.2 million, an increase of 18% from the year ago quarter and 1% from the prior quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $139.4 million, up 14% year-over-year and 3% from the prior quarter. For the full year, total revenue was $652.6 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year, and subscription revenue was $541.2 million, up 20% year-over-year.
GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2009 was $20.2 million and $82.5 million, respectively. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $39.8 million, or a 23.9% operating margin, up 70 basis points from the prior quarter and 180 basis points from the year ago quarter. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $148.4 million, an increase of 24% from the prior year.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $16.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with $24.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $22.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $42.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation, amortization and tax expense as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $48.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $45.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Both the prior quarter and the year ago fourth quarter included one-time gains in other income of $4.1 million and $4.7 million respectively that are not included in the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter.
For the full year, GAAP net income was $78.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with $76.7 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year was $178.1 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $165.3 million and $0.77 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2008.
Operating cash flow totaled $59.7 million for the quarter and $236.4 million for the full year. At year end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $543.1 million, an increase of 15% on a year-over-year basis and 8% sequentially. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of February 28, 2009 were $846.1 million after redeeming the remaining balance of $285.5 million of convertible debentures during the quarter.
Our ability to demonstrate real value and deliver cost savings to our customers enabled us to achieve significant new milestones during the quarter, including billings in excess of $200 million and more than 100 deals in excess of $250,000. Our value proposition is even more compelling in a challenging economic environment, and we believe thats a key driver to our solid financial results and market share gains, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. For the full fiscal year, we achieved an impressive combination of 25% revenue growth, 24% non-GAAP operating income growth and operating cash flow of $236 million, while renewing 100% of our top 25 customers up for renewal each quarter.
Solid execution by our associates and focused expense management on a continuing basis has enabled us to exceed our guidance for non-GAAP operating margins and EPS for the fourth quarter, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. We continue to enhance the companys already strong financial profile. We ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents and investments of $846 million and essentially no debt. During fiscal year 2009, we redeemed $570 million in convertible debt and repurchased 2.9 million shares of the companys common stock, which reduced our diluted share count by more than 10%. In summary, it was a strong year in a very difficult economic climate.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at . A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the live event has ended.
