As previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed November 7, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") elected Micheline Chau and Jeff Clarke to serve as members of the Board effective November 3, 2008. At that time, the Company announced that neither Ms. Chau nor Mr. Clarke had been appointed to any Board committees. This Amendment No. 1 to Form 8-K is being filed to announce that on March 24, 2009, the Board appointed Ms. Chau to the Board's Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees and Mr. Clarke to the Board's Audit and Compensation Committees. The Board has determined that neither Ms. Chau nor Mr. Clarke has any material relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of them is an independent director under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
