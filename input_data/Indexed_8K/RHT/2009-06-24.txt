Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On June 24, 2009, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2009. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"); and
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $10.7 million and $10.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.0 million and $3.7 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets.  Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

Repurchased $47 million of common stock
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 24, 2009--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2010 first quarter ended May 31, 2009.
Total revenue for the quarter was $174.4 million, an increase of 11% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $148.8 million, up 14% year-over-year.
We are pleased to report better than expected revenue and EPS results in Q1, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. Red Hats growth is driven in part by our ability to help enterprise customers save money in a challenging IT spending environment. Our open source solutions drive new capabilities, efficiencies and functionality into the mission critical infrastructure of our customers.
GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $25.1 million, or a 14.4% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $40.7 million, up 19% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.4%, up 160 basis points from the year ago quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $18.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $17.3 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $28.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, as compared to $26.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow totaled $61.2 million, as compared to $63.4 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $567.3 million, an increase of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of May 31, 2009 were $884.5 million.
While we remain focused on managing discretionary costs and improving efficiencies, we also continue to invest in growth opportunities in middleware, virtualization and cloud computing, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. These efforts combined with solid top line growth contributed to non-GAAP operating income growth of 19% year-over-year and healthy cash flow. In the quarter, we repurchased $47 million of common stock while strengthening our balance sheet with a 5% sequential increase in cash and investments. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced our diluted shares outstanding by approximately 11%.
Other highlights include the following:
We announced our JBoss Open Choice strategy, which is intended to address the evolving needs of application developers and the changing market by embracing a variety of programming models, frameworks and languages. Executing on this strategy, Red Hat now has application platform solutions for common Java application workloads; from simple web applications, to light and rich Java applications, to Java Enterprise Edition (EE) based applications. Our new JBoss platforms support a variety of popular programming models including Spring Framework, Seam and Google Web Toolkit.
Delivering on Red Hats virtualization strategy and roadmap, the company announced the beta releases of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization portfolio of products, all of which are integrated with our KVM hypervisor. Included in the beta release is a new management product for the management of server virtualization. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization portfolio will leverage Red Hats broad certified ecosystem and will offer flexibility, operational choice and efficiency to customers.
