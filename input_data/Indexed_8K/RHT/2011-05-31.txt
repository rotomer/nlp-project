As previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 28, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") has elected Sohaib Abbasi and W. Steve Albrecht to serve on the Board, effective March 22, 2011. At that time, the Company announced that neither Mr. Abbasi nor Mr. Albrecht had been appointed to any Board committees. This Amendment No. 1 to Form 8-K is being filed to announce that on May 25, 2011, the Board appointed both Mr. Abbasi and Mr. Albrecht to the Board's Audit and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. The Board has determined that neither Mr. Abbasi nor Mr. Albrecht has any material relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of them is an independent director under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
