On June 22, 2011, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2011. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months ended May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718"); and
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.  
Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $16.2 million and $13.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense which may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the particular period's operational performance. For example, the amount recognized for share-based awards is directly related to the underlying share price of our common stock as of the date of grant, which, in the short-term, may not be directly related to our operational performance. Consequently, management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.9 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the potential variability in valuing share-based awards and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 22, 2011--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2012 first quarter ended May 31, 2011.
Total revenue for the quarter was $264.7 million, an increase of 27% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $225.5 million, up 26% year-over-year.
Red Hat has begun fiscal year 2012 with a strong first quarter including year-over-year billings growth of 28% that contributed to revenue and profitability that exceeded the high-end of our expectations, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. We believe there is a fundamental shift in IT spending, in which cloud computing and virtualization have become key strategic priorities. We believe that Red Hat is well positioned to capitalize on this growing demand as enterprise customers look to Red Hat when upgrading and modernizing their IT infrastructure.
GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $45.4 million, or a 17.1% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $66.5 million, up 28% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.1%, up 30 basis points from the year ago quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $32.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with $24.1 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $47.0 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, as compared to $35.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow was $90.2 million for the first quarter, as compared to $60.6 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $786.0 million, an increase of 26% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of May 31, 2011 was $1.27 billion.
Strong sales execution, focused spending and good collections drove 49% growth in operating cash flow year-over-year, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. Red Hat grew first quarter non-GAAP operating income by 28% year-over-year even as we ramped up marketing spending for the Red Hat Summit and product launches, and continued investments in R&D to enable further broadening of our product portfolio. We introduced innovative new cloud technologies such as OpenShift, our PaaS offering, and CloudForms, our IaaS offering. In addition, we enhanced our core products, including the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 and strengthened our partnerships with the launch of Open Virtualization Alliance.
