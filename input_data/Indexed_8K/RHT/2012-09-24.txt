Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On September 24, 2012, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2012. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
In the press release, we disclosed non-GAAP financial information for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2012 and August 31, 2011. These non-GAAP disclosures include non-GAAP revenue growth rates measured on a constant currency basis and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
We disclosed non-GAAP revenue growth rates for subscription revenue and total revenue measured on a constant currency basis for the three months ended August 31, 2012, in an effort to provide a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed when compared to the three months ended August 31, 2011.   Approximately 43% of our revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2012, was produced by sales outside the United States. The income statements of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for each month in an applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of transactions denominated in foreign currencies results in increased revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations decreases if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies.  Using the average foreign currency exchange rates for each month of the three months ended August 31, 2011, our subscription revenue and total revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2012, would have been higher than we reported by $12.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense which may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the particular periods operational performance. For example, the amount recognized for share-based awards is directly related to the underlying share price of our common stock as of the date of grant, which, in the short-term, may not be directly related to our operational performance. Consequently, management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.     Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $23.9 million and $46.1 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2012, and $18.8 million and $34.9 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.4 million and $10.3 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2012, and $5.2 million and $10.1 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a charge we recorded in connection with the Facility Exit.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP expense of $3.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2012.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the effect of exchange rate differences, potential variations in the amount of expense for share-based awards recognized from period to period due to changes in the price of our common stock, the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and the non-recurring nature of the expense we recognized in connection with the Facility Exit. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.

Total revenue for the quarter was $322.6 million, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars from the year ago quarter, or 20% measured in constant currency, as detailed in the tables below. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $278.8 million, up 17% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, or 22% measured in constant currency, as detailed in the tables below.

GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $50.0 million, down 5% year-over-year. GAAP operating margin was 15.5%. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $79.2 million, up 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.6%.
Net income for the quarter was $35.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $40.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $54.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, as compared to $56.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. The year ago quarter would have been $0.28 per diluted share excluding a discrete tax benefit of $2.1 million, or approximately $0.01 per share.
Operating cash flow was $103.9 million for the second quarter, as compared to $77.1 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $944.4 million, an increase of 16% on a year-over-year basis.

On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue grew 22% year-over-year while total revenue grew 20%. Our business model and offerings continue to appeal to customers despite the global economic malaise, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. This quarter marked a significant ramp-up in investments in our nascent storage business, with the launch in late June of Red Hat Storage Server 2.0. Furthermore, we announced two small technology acquisitions in the middleware space to further round out our offerings, which decreased the quarters EPS by approximately $0.01 per share due to one-time closing costs.

A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at .
