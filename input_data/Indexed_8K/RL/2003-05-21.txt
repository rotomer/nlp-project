Investor Contact: Suzanne J. Rosenberg 212.318.7516 Media Contact: Jim Abernathy 212.371.5999 POLO RALPH LAUREN REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2003 RESULTS; INITIATES REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND New York (May 21, 2003) - Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today reported adjusted net income of $76.1 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 ended March 29, 2003, compared to adjusted net income of $57.0 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the comparable year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter Fiscal 2003 net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") was $73.2 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to net income of $48.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002. The adjusted figures for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 exclude a pre-tax $6.4 million restructuring charge for operational consolidation efforts in Europe, which the Company announced in November 2002. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002, the adjusted numbers exclude a pre-tax $16.0 million real estate restructuring charge. For both the Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 quarters, the results are adjusted to exclude gains on foreign currency translations of $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The Company believes that these adjusted results provide a more meaningful comparison of its ongoing operational and financial results. For a full analysis of the adjustments, please refer to the table reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. For Fiscal 2003, adjusted net income increased to $183.7 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, compared to pro forma adjusted net income of $163.2 million, or $1.66 per diluted share for the prior year. In accordance with GAAP, full year Fiscal 2003 net income was $174.2 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, compared to net income of $172.5 million, or $1.75 per diluted share for Fiscal 2002. The adjusted figures for Fiscal 2003 exclude a pre-tax $14.4 million restructuring charge related to the aforementioned operational consolidation efforts in Europe. For Fiscal 2002, the adjusted pro forma information reports the European business on a current basis consistent with Fiscal 2003 results and is adjusted to exclude a pre-tax $16.0 million real estate restructuring charge. The results are adjusted to exclude a loss on foreign currency translation of $0.5 million in Fiscal 2003 and a foreign currency translation gain of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2002. The Company believes that these adjusted results provide a more meaningful comparison of its ongoing operational and financial results. For a full analysis of the adjustments, please refer to the table reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. "Strong customer demand and a balanced growth strategy delivered another record year of results, despite ongoing challenges in the marketplace," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. "We enjoyed record success in our own specialty retail business, while we continued to be an important brand to our department store partners. We drove solid domestic results and accelerated our growth in international markets. Our ability to produce strong results from multiple channels and in multiple geographies, reinforces our belief that our brands and flexible business model are truly unique, giving us the ability to drive profitable long-term growth." "We enter the 2004 fiscal year with a seasoned executive team, dedicated and creative employees and the necessary resources to continue our worldwide profitable growth," Mr. Lauren added. "Our double-digit earnings growth was driven by the increasingly strong customer response to our luxury lifestyle products and the performance and flexibility of our multi-year initiatives," said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. "We are particularly pleased with the strength of our retail operations as we continue to make improvements in all of our store formats. In addition, ongoing improvements to our supply chain and information systems have significantly enhanced our ability to better manage our global business, despite a difficult environment." "Our focused expense and capital spending, our ongoing improvements in inventory management and the increased efficiencies generated by these ongoing initiatives have enabled us to add to the strength of our balance sheet. We are particularly pleased with the progress we are making in our European consolidation," Mr. Farah stated. INITIATION OF REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND The Board of Directors of Polo Ralph Lauren today declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per share on an annual basis, on Polo Ralph Lauren common stock. The dividend is payable July 11, 2003 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2003. Based on the current number of shares outstanding, the dividend will result in an anticipated annualized payout of approximately $20 million. EARNINGS OUTLOOK The Company reaffirmed its Fiscal 2004 guidance, previously issued on February 6, 2003, which anticipates modest revenue increases to produce adjusted earnings growth to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 per share. The sales increases are expected to be driven by increased retail sales offset by planned decreases in the Company's men's domestic wholesale business and low single digit sales in Europe impacted by the consolidation process. For the first half of Fiscal 2004, the Company would expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.69, excluding foreign currency gains and losses. The Company would expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.02 to $0.06 and second quarter adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.63 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings per share of $0.09 and $0.52 for the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2003, respectively.
