ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. On June 3, 2003, Jones Apparel Group, Inc. ("Jones") filed a lawsuit against the Registrant in the Supreme Court of the State of New York alleging among other things that the Registrant breached its agreements with Jones with respect to the "Lauren" trademark by asserting its rights pursuant to the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement, between the Registrant and Jones dated May 11, 1998, and that the Registrant induced Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the former President of Jones, to breach the non-compete and confidentiality clauses in Ms. Nemerov's employment agreement with Jones. Jones has indicated that it will treat the Lauren license agreements as terminated as of December 31, 2003. Jones is seeking compensatory damages of $550 million as well as punitive damages and to enforce the provisions of Ms. Nemerov's agreement. If Jones' lawsuit against the Registrant were determined adversely to the Registrant, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Registrant; however, we believe that the lawsuit is without merit and that the Registrant will prevail. Also on June 3, 2003, the Registrant filed a lawsuit against Jones in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. A copy of a press release regarding the lawsuit filed by the Registrant is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7.

Exhibit 99.1 Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (ticker: RL, exchange: New York Stock Exchange) News Release - 6/3/2003 - ----------------------------------------- Polo Ralph Lauren to Enforce its Contractual Right to Reclaim Key Licenses from Jones Apparel Group NEW YORK, Jun 3, 2003 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today announced it has filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Jones Apparel Group, Inc. seeking among other things an injunction and a declaratory judgment that the Lauren license agreements terminate as of December 31, 2003 pursuant to the express terms of a separate cross-default agreement executed by the parties. The Cross-Default Agreement executed by the companies on or about May 11, 1998 provides that the "termination or expiration" of any of the Lauren Agreements or Ralph Agreements "shall result in the simultaneous termination or expiration" of all such agreements. Polo Ralph Lauren believes that the Cross-Default Agreement was triggered when Jones failed to meet its minimum aggregate net sales volume for the period of January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 required to permit the renewal of the Ralph license agreements. Jones admits that the Ralph license agreement terminate effective December 31, 2003. Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer of Polo Ralph Lauren, said, "We regret taking this action, but we felt we had no choice but to seek immediate Court relief from what we believe is obstructionist behavior from a business partner that may irreparably damage our brands. We believe that we are well within our legal right to reclaim our licenses. We are confident that the Court will enforce our clear contractual rights enabling us to serve our customers without interruption."
