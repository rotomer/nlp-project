First quarter Fiscal 2004 net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") was $5.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2003. For the Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 quarters, the results are adjusted to exclude a gain on foreign currency translation of $2.3 million and a loss on foreign currency translation of $3.5 million, respectively. The Company believes that these adjusted results provide a more meaningful comparison of its ongoing operational and financial results. For a full analysis of the adjustments, please refer to the table reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. "We are pleased with our strong retail performance, especially in our Ralph Lauren stores. This is testimony to the strength of our brands, the desirability of our designs and our growing expertise in specialty retailing. We continue to expand the Polo Ralph Lauren brands into new markets, countries and shopping environments creating a truly global company that is about product, design, quality and growth," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We're excited about the opportunities that the Lauren women's business brings to us. This is a major brand we designed and created eight years ago and built into the most successful better womenswear line introduced in the past decade. We are on track with the Lauren Spring 2004 line. We have met with many of our key retail accounts and the initial reaction has been extremely positive. We are excited about showing the line to buyers in September. Our customers will benefit from the upgrades in quality and fabrication we are building into the line, while we are remaining true to the style and fit they have come to expect from the brand. We believe that Lauren will be a significant long-term growth driver for our Company," Mr. Lauren added. "During the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our multi-year initiatives. We completed the European consolidation on time and on budget. Our new Geneva headquarters opened in June and we began shipping from our new distribution center in Parma, Italy during the quarter. In addition, we are pleased with the results from our Japanese business since we increased direct ownership of this business," said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. "Our continuing investment in common systems moves us further along our strategy of having an infrastructure to support our global growth plans."
FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2004 ACHIEVEMENTS o Assumed operating responsibility for the Lauren brand as a result of the termination of the Lauren apparel license. In June the Company announced the leadership team to execute the Lauren business and is on track to showcase the Spring 2004 line to the wholesale community in September 2003. o Completed the consolidation of its European operations on schedule, including opening a new headquarters office in Geneva, Switzerland and consolidating the majority of the distribution activities in one state-of-the-art facility in Parma, Italy. The European consolidation was a significant step forward in developing a global operating platform to support long-term growth. o Delivered double digit retail sales comps at Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores and mid-single digit sales comps in outlet stores. o Opened the first domestic Ralph Lauren baby store in New York City offering an enhanced range of Ralph Lauren classic and vintage apparel and accessories for layette and infant, girls and boys in a unique shopping experience. The store also features a selection of fine giftware as well as quilts and pillows in signature Ralph Lauren Home fabrics. o Opened a 14,000 square foot interior designer showroom in the Designers and Decorators Building in New York City. This is a significant first step in expanding the reach of the Company's Ralph Lauren Home business into the professional home decorating and design community and the Company may open showrooms in other major cities in the United States. This is part of a tiered strategy in the Company's home business, which is currently marketed in Ralph Lauren stores in the United States and Europe under the Ralph Lauren Home brand and in department stores in the United States under the Lauren brand. o Reduced short-term bank borrowings by more than $50 million. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, on June 30, the Company paid down the remainder of short-term bank borrowings. o Initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per share on an annual basis, on Polo Ralph Lauren common stock. The first quarterly dividend was paid on July 11, 2003. Based on the current number of shares outstanding, the dividend will result in an anticipated annualized payout of approximately $20 million. FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2004 INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW NET REVENUES Net revenues were $477.7 million for the first quarter, an increase of 2.3%, compared to $467.0 million in the comparable year-ago quarter. Revenues were driven by double digit increases in total retail sales and strong licensing royalty growth, partially offset by a decline in the wholesale business. Retail sales comps rose 8.3%, driven by positive comps in all of the Company's worldwide retail formats. GROSS PROFIT For the first quarter, gross profit was 52.1% of net revenues compared to 49.8% of net revenues in the comparable year-ago quarter. The improved gross margins were driven by increased licensing royalties from the Japanese business and a change in business mix resulting in retail sales representing more than 50% of revenues in the quarter. SG&A EXPENSES Total SG&A expenses were $243.2 million for the first quarter, or 50.9% of net revenues, compared to $214.9 million, or 46.0% of net revenues, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2003. The increase was driven primarily by the costs associated with the consolidation of the European wholesale and retail businesses, a change in business mix as a result of increased retail sales and the consolidation of expenses of the Japanese master license. STORE COUNT At quarter end, the Company operated 261 stores compared to 237 stores at the first quarter end last year. For the period ended June 28, 2003, the company's retail group consisted of 54 Ralph Lauren stores, 62
Club Monaco stores, 93 full line Outlet stores, 22 Polo Jeans Co. Outlet stores, 21 European Outlet stores and nine Club Monaco outlet stores. During the first quarter the Company added six stores. EARNINGS OUTLOOK The Company reiterated that for Fiscal 2004, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05, which anticipates modest revenue increases and ongoing improvements in operating margins. Full-year adjusted earnings per share exclude foreign currency gains and losses, Lauren start-up costs and the loss of licensing royalty associated with the Lauren and Ralph lines in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The Company expects the Lauren start-up costs and the loss of licensing royalty associated with the Lauren and Ralph lines in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 to be approximately $0.20 per share in Fiscal 2004. Including expenses associated with the start-up of the Lauren line and lost licensing royalty, the Company expects adjusted earnings per share in Fiscal 2004 to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.85. The Company also reiterated that for the second quarter of Fiscal 2004, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.63. This compares to adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 for the second quarter of Fiscal 2003. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share exclude foreign currency gains and losses and start-up costs associated with the Lauren line. The Company expects the Lauren line start-up costs to be approximately $0.08 per share in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. Including expenses associated with the start-up of the Lauren line, the Company expects adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004 to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.55. After preliminary discussions with key retailers, the Company is building plans to sell the Lauren line in approximately 850 doors for Missy and approximately 450 doors for special sizes and expects the Lauren line in its first full year of operations to generate revenues of approximately $400 million in Fiscal 2005.
