Second quarter Fiscal 2004 net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") was $54.0 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to net income of $51.7 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2003. For the Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 quarters, the results are adjusted to exclude foreign currency gains and losses resulting from certain balance sheet transactions. The Company believes that these adjusted results provide a meaningful comparison of its ongoing operational and financial results. For a full analysis of the adjustments, please refer to the table reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. "We are pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with our strong retail performance. Our powerful combination of exciting products and advertising and targeted marketing is generating more profitable growth from our stores," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have significantly strengthened our management team with several additions both domestically and internationally. Our organization has never been stronger and we have the right team in place to continue to drive our long-term growth strategies." "Looking toward the second half of our year, we are well positioned for the holiday season and are expecting another strong performance for the balance of the year," Mr. Lauren added. "The increased efficiencies realized from our multi-year operating initiatives enabled us to deliver a 10% sales increase in the quarter while controlling inventory levels and increasing our profits. We made great progress on many fronts that position us well for continued global growth and expansion," said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. "The new Lauren line is on-track with more than 850 doors scheduled to take delivery of the Spring 2004 line that we will begin shipping in January. Internationally, our European operations integration continues on plan which is resulting in a stronger infrastructure to support our anticipated growth there. In addition, we are pleased with our performance in Japan and our ongoing direct involvement as we look to substantially increase our business throughout Asia."
RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS o Delivered mid-to-high-teens retail sales comps in the second quarter at Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores, and mid-single digit sales comps in outlet stores. o Continued Asian expansion by opening a 4,200 square foot Ralph Lauren flagship store in Seoul, South Korea and a 2,300 square foot store in Singapore in September 2003. Both stores, owned and operated by licensed partners, offer a complete range of Ralph Lauren's luxury apparel and accessories. o Introduced Home Collection in London's New Bond Street flagship store in September 2003. The new home floor, including a full design center, is approximately 3,700 square feet, making it the largest Ralph Lauren Home presentation in Europe and one of the largest for Ralph Lauren Home worldwide. o Presented the Spring 2004 Lauren by Ralph Lauren line in September 2003. The line was extremely well received by the retail buyers and we continue to expect revenues of approximately $400 million in Fiscal 2005, the line's first full-year of operations. Our Greensboro distribution center is on schedule to handle the Lauren line. The Summer 2004 Lauren line will open at market to buyers in mid-November. o Paid down our short-term bank borrowings resulting in a zero short-term debt balance. o Continued to strengthen the global management team with the promotion of Bridget Ryan Berman to the newly created position of Group President of Polo Ralph Lauren Retail and with the addition of Ken Pilot as President Factory Stores and Retail Concept Development, Kim Roy as President of Lauren by Ralph Lauren, Brian Duffy as President and Chief Operating Officer of Polo Europe, and Don Baum as Senior Vice President of Global Manufacturing. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2004 INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW NET REVENUES Net revenues were $707.8 million for the second quarter, an increase of 10.4%, compared to $640.8 million in the comparable year-ago quarter. Revenues were driven by double digit increases in total retail sales and international licensing royalties, as well as an 8.2% increase in the wholesale business. Retail sales comps rose 8.3%, driven by positive comps in all of the Company's retail formats. GROSS PROFIT For the second quarter, gross profit was $350.6 million, an increase of 9.1%, compared to $321.3 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2003, benefiting primarily from strong retail sales performance and increased royalties driven by increased ownership of the Japanese business. Gross margin for the second quarter was 49.5% of net revenues compared to 50.1% of net revenues in the comparable year-ago quarter. The change in gross margin is primarily attributable to softness in the European wholesale business and the promotional environment at department stores in men's wholesale, partially offset by strong increases in retail merchandise margins. SG&A EXPENSES Total SG&A expenses in the second quarter were $267.6 million, an increase of 13.1%, compared to $236.6 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2003. The increase was driven primarily by a
change in business mix as a result of increased retail sales, the start-up costs associated with the operations of the Lauren line and the consolidation of expenses of the Japanese master license. STORE COUNT At quarter end, the Company operated 265 stores compared to 243 stores at the second quarter end last year. For the period ended September 27, 2003, the company's retail group consisted of 54 Ralph Lauren stores, 62 Club Monaco stores, 96 full line Outlet stores, 22 Polo Jeans Co. Outlet stores, 22 European Outlet stores and nine Club Monaco outlet stores. During the second quarter the Company opened six stores and closed two stores. EARNINGS OUTLOOK The Company reiterated its previous guidance that adjusted earnings per share for Fiscal 2004 are expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.85, which anticipates mid-single digit revenue increases. These projected results include approximately $0.20 per share associated with Lauren start-up costs and the loss of licensing royalty associated with the Lauren and Ralph lines in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2004. Adjusted earnings per share exclude foreign currency gains and losses resulting from certain balance sheet transactions. For the third quarter of Fiscal 2004 adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.49 compared to $0.47 for the third quarter of Fiscal 2003. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80, compared to $0.77 for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003.
