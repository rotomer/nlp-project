Adjusted net income was $47.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2004 compared to adjusted net income of $47.1 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2003. The results are adjusted to exclude restructuring charges and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from certain balance sheet transactions. The Company believes that these adjusted results provide a meaningful comparison of its ongoing operational and financial results. For a full analysis of the adjustments, please refer to the table reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. "Our success continues to be driven by our own specialty stores and in better department stores, which have the right mix of products, strong customer service and a clear point of view. We know that at the core of our success is the ability to attract customers through exciting products, strong merchandising and dramatic advertising and marketing," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Commenting on the outlook, Mr. Lauren said "We are very excited about the future of our Company and feel that the upcoming year is one where we are ready to deliver a higher profit level as a result of our past years' efforts." "We are very pleased to report such a strong quarter and believe that these results continue to demonstrate our ability to execute on our multi-year initiatives on many fronts. Our retail business had a terrific quarter and our year-to-date retail sales reflect improved performance in all our retail formats," said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. "In addition, the consolidation in Europe is on track for completion this year and we have initiated important new programs in our wholesale business to better control the distribution and presentation of the brands. During this pivotal year, we took on the direct responsibility for the operations of the Lauren brand, and in just eight months built an entire organization, designed, manufactured and brought to market two complete collections with improvements in fabric and details, created an advertising and marketing campaign, constructed a warehouse system that is currently shipping out the first season on schedule, and prepared our Fall collection for market in March."
RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS o Delivered mid-teens sales comps in the third quarter at Ralph Lauren stores, low-twenties retail sales comps at Club Monaco stores, and mid-single digit sales comps in outlet stores, with a 290 basis point improvement in margins. o Continued strategy to expand Ralph Lauren specialty retail stores in appropriate locations by opening a new 3,500 square foot store in New Canaan, CT, offering a selection of apparel for men and women as well as childrenswear. o Presented the Summer 2004 Lauren by Ralph Lauren line in November 2003. The Spring and Summer lines were well received by the retail buyers and we continue to expect revenues of approximately $400 million with mid-teen margins in Fiscal 2005, the line's first full-year of operations. Our Greensboro distribution center has begun to handle the Lauren line and delivery of Spring 2004 merchandise was on schedule to department stores beginning in January. o Continued strategy to further develop growth opportunities in Asia by strengthening the global management team through the addition of Andreas Kurz as Division President of International Licensing to manage Polo's licensed businesses in that part of the world. o Launched international local-language web sites for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Chile, Japan and Australia with features such as store locators and fashion show viewings. o Paid down short-term debt in the first half of the fiscal year and ended the third quarter with $53.0 million in cash net of debt. THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2004 INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW NET REVENUES Net revenues were $645.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 1.0%, compared to $639.2 million in the comparable year-ago quarter. Revenues were driven by double-digit percent increases in retail sales and licensing royalties, which were partially offset by a decrease in the wholesale business, primarily in the secondary off-price market. Retail sales comps rose 8.8%, driven by positive comps in all of the Company's retail formats. GROSS PROFIT For the third quarter, gross profit was $333.0 million, an increase of 8.1%, compared to $307.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2003, benefiting primarily from strong retail sales performance and increased licensing royalties, partially offset by a decrease in the men's wholesale business. Gross margin for the third quarter was 51.6% of net revenues compared to 48.2% of net revenues in the comparable year-ago quarter, an improvement of 340 basis points. SG&A EXPENSES Total SG&A expenses in the third quarter were $256.6 million, an increase of $26.2 million or 11.4%, compared to $230.4 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2003. The increase was driven primarily by the start-up costs associated with the operations of the Lauren line, the change in business mix as a result of increased retail sales, and the consolidation of expenses of the Japanese master license.
STORE COUNT At quarter end, the Company operated 265 stores compared to 251 stores at the third quarter end last year. For the period ended December 27, 2003, the company's retail group consisted of 55 Ralph Lauren stores, 62 Club Monaco stores, 117 Polo Outlet stores, 22 Polo Jeans Co. Outlet stores, and nine Club Monaco outlet stores. During the third quarter the Company opened one store and closed one. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES Third quarter Fiscal 2004 results include a pre-tax $15.9 million restructuring charge. Approximately $12.2 million of the restructuring charge is related to an adjustment to the reserve for lease termination costs primarily associated with two Club Monaco properties, which were included in the Company's 2001 Operational Plan. The reserve was adjusted in the third quarter Fiscal 2004 because of market factors less favorable than estimated. Approximately $3.7 million of the restructuring charge is related to operational consolidation efforts in Europe associated with severance and contract termination costs. Third quarter Fiscal 2003 results include a pre-tax $8.0 million restructuring charge for operational consolidation efforts in Europe associated with severance and contract termination costs included in the Company's 2003 Restructuring Plan. Third quarter Fiscal 2004 results include $3.6 million in foreign currency losses primarily related to transaction losses on unhedged inventory purchases in Europe. Third quarter Fiscal 2003 results include $1.3 million in foreign currency gains primarily related to Japanese forward contracts entered into in November 2002. SECONDARY OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK The Company expects to file a registration statement with the SEC later this month to conduct a secondary offering of up to 10.6 million shares of common stock owned by investment funds managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. Neither the Company, Mr. Ralph Lauren, nor any of his related entities will be converting or selling any shares in the offering or receiving any proceeds from the offering. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Please refer to the separate announcement issued today by the Company. EARNINGS OUTLOOK The Company reiterated its previous guidance that adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 is expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 compared to $0.77 for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. These projected results include approximately $0.04 loss per share associated with Lauren start-up costs and the loss of licensing revenues associated with the Lauren, Ralph and Canadian license royalties. Adjusted earnings per share exclude restructuring charges and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from certain balance sheet transactions. For Fiscal 2005, earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45, excluding any foreign currency gains and losses resulting from certain balance sheet transactions. The Company expects high single-digit percent consolidated revenue growth to drive approximately 150 basis points improvement in operating margins. Revenues are expected to reflect mid-teen percent growth in wholesale and mid-single digit percent growth in retail, partially offset by a slight decrease in licensing revenue as a result of the elimination of the Lauren, Ralph and Canadian license royalties.
