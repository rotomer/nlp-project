Adjusted net income was $14.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for first quarter Fiscal 2005 compared to $3.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for first quarter Fiscal 2004. Adjusted results exclude restructuring charges and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from certain balance sheet transactions. For a full analysis of the adjustments, please refer to the table reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. "We are executing at every level of our company," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "With sales in our retail stores outperforming the industry, we see phenomenal response to our luxury designs. Our Polo brand continues to lead in the menswear arena, and its performance this spring at retail has never been stronger. And the new deliveries of our Lauren women's line have been well received," Mr. Lauren said, adding, "Our company is financially strong and poised to produce record profits for fiscal 2005." "This strong performance in our first quarter gives us a good start for the new fiscal year," said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. "Our retail and wholesale growth initiatives coupled with our more efficient support operations are beginning to yield the significant sales and margin improvements we envisioned. Further, with the groundwork substantially complete in Europe we look forward to renewing our growth in this important market. And we continue to make strong progress on our long-term goals of better controlling our brand worldwide, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of our children's business."
RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS o We completed the acquisition of RL Childrenswear LLC, our licensee for childrenswear in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The purchase was a cash transaction for approximately $240 million, plus contingent and deferred payments not to exceed $20 million. We expect Fiscal 2006 revenues for childrenswear to be more than $200 million, with earnings per share to be accretive in the range of $0.15 to $0.20. o Comparable retail store sales were 16.1% at Ralph Lauren stores, 10.4% at Club Monaco stores, and 11.6% in our outlet stores, with an overall 510 basis point improvement in operating margins. Our store expansion plan is on track with the opening of the Ralph Lauren Nantucket store in the first quarter and with plans to open three Ralph Lauren stores in the second quarter of Fiscal 2005, including our Milan flagship store, as well as five Club Monaco stores. o The women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren Summer line was successfully delivered to approximately 900 department store doors on plan throughout the quarter, with strong sell-throughs. We continue to expect approximately $400 million in revenues in Fiscal 2005 with mid-teens operating margins. o We have a strong balance sheet and continue to make excellent progress in managing our inventory levels. We had a 29% sales increase in the first quarter in our wholesale and retail businesses with 9% less inventory, excluding childrenswear, than the first quarter of last year. At the end of the first quarter, inventory was $418.0 million, including the women's Lauren line and childrenswear this year, compared to $430.1 million last year. We ended the quarter with $174.9 million in cash, after paying cash for the acquisition of RL Childrenswear. FIRST QUARTER INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW NET REVENUES Net revenues for the first quarter increased 24.1% to $592.8 million compared to $477.7 million in the first quarter last year. Retail sales grew 16.6% to $296.8 million compared to $254.5 million last year, with comparable store sales up 12.6%, driven by positive performance in all of our retail formats. Our wholesale revenues were $239.0 million, up 47.9% over last year, driven by the inclusion of the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren line in our wholesale segment, gains in our European business and increased sales in our women's collection business. Wholesale revenues also reflect a decrease in the menswear off-price channel, as we continue to reposition the Polo brand into more selective department and specialty stores while reducing sales into the secondary market. Licensing revenues decreased, as planned, primarily because of the absence of royalty income associated with the previously licensed Lauren business. The increase in Fiscal 2005 net revenues also reflects the favorable impact of the strengthening Eurodollar. GROSS PROFIT For the first quarter, gross profit was $307.1 million, an increase of $58.3 million, or 23.5%, compared to $248.8 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2004. The increased gross profit was generated by the addition of the women's Lauren line and strong full-price sell-throughs in our Ralph Lauren stores in the United States and Europe and in our Club Monaco stores. Gross margin significantly improved in our specialty retail segment and in our domestic wholesale men's and women's lines. Our overall gross margin decreased to 51.8% of net revenues compared to 52.1% last year, reflecting the reduction in licensing revenue and mix of business results. The increase in Fiscal 2005 gross profit also reflects the favorable impact of the strengthening Eurodollar. SG&A EXPENSES Operating expenses as a percent of revenues were 48.2% this year compared to 50.9% last year. In the first quarter, SG&A expenses were $285.8 million, an increase of $42.5 million or 17.5%, compared to $243.2 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2004. The dollar increase was driven primarily by the change in business mix as a result of expenses associated with the operations of the women's Lauren line and increased retail sales. SG&A also includes $3.0 million to buy back a royalty sharing agreement related to the use of our trademarks in various countries in Central and South America. The increase in Fiscal 2005 SG&A also reflects the negative impact of the strengthening Eurodollar.
FIRST QUARTER FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES Adjusted first quarter Fiscal 2005 results exclude $0.7 million in restructuring charges related to operational consolidation efforts in Europe associated with severance costs and $0.2 million in foreign currency losses. Adjusted first quarter Fiscal 2004 results exclude foreign currency gains of $2.3 million primarily related to transaction gains on royalty payments. STORE COUNT At the end of the first quarter, we operated 262 stores, with 1.87 million square feet, compared to 261 stores, with 1.85 million square feet, at the end of the first quarter last year. Our retail group consisted of 56 Ralph Lauren stores, 60 Club Monaco stores, 120 Polo outlet stores, 21 Polo Jeans Co. outlet stores, and five Club Monaco outlet stores. During the first quarter we opened three stores and closed four. EARNINGS OUTLOOK FULL YEAR The company reiterated that for Fiscal Year 2005 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. These projected results anticipate mid-teens percent consolidated revenue growth and approximately 140 basis points improvement in operating margins. The Company expects revenues to reflect low-thirties percent growth in wholesale sales and mid-single digit percent growth in retail revenues, partially offset by a low-double digit percent decrease in licensing revenue as a result of the elimination of the women's Lauren, Ralph and childrenswear license royalties. The Company reiterated that it expects the earnings results of each quarter in Fiscal 2005 to exceed the comparable quarter in Fiscal 2004 with quarterly profit flows similar to Fiscal 2004, with the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of a 52-week year compared to a 53-week year last year. SECOND QUARTER For the second quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company expects consolidated revenues to increase high-teens percent. We expect that our wholesale revenues will increase low-forties percent reflecting the inclusion of women's Lauren and childrenswear revenues in that segment as we ship our Fall merchandise. We expect our second quarter wholesale sales in Europe to increase high-single digits. This will be partially offset by the continuing positioning of our men's apparel in brand-appropriate channels in the United States. Retail revenues are expected to increase mid-single digit percent and licensing revenues are expected to decrease high-teens percent reflecting the absence of royalties associated with the women's Lauren and Ralph lines and childrenswear license royalties. The Company expects operating profits in the second quarter to be the second largest in the year, with operating margin expansion in both wholesale and retail businesses. Licensing operating profit is expected to decrease, reflecting the absence of royalties from the women's Lauren, Ralph and childrenswear lines. Shares outstanding are expected to increase by approximately 2 million shares compared to last year.
