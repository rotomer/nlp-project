EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ 650 Madison Avenue [GRAPHIC OMITTED] New York, New York 10022 [LOGO - POLO RALPH LAUREN] Press Release Investor Contact: Denise Gillen 212.318.7516 Media Contact: Nancy Murray 212.813.7862 Polo Ralph Lauren Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results Second Quarter Operating Profit Increased 49%; Revenues Up 25% Driven by Lauren by Ralph Lauren Women's Line and Childrenswear; Operating Margins Increased 230 Basis Points Company Confirms EPS Outlook for Fiscal Year 2005 in Range of $2.35 to $2.45 New York (November 3, 2004) - Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today reported net income of $80.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2005 compared to net income of $54.0 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. Adjusted net income was $79.0 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2005 compared to $52.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. Adjusted results exclude restructuring charges and foreign currency gains resulting from certain transactions in our European operations. For a full analysis of the adjustments, please refer to the table reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. For the first half of Fiscal 2005, reported net income increased 59% to $93.8 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $59.1 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the first half of Fiscal 2004. Adjusted net income was $93.0 million, or $0.90 per diluted share in the first half of Fiscal 2005 compared to $56.5 million, or $0.56 per diluted share in the first half of Fiscal 2004. "I am pleased with the excitement about our brand and the growing global demand for our products. Through our retail business, we have taken strong steps to expand our luxury position. In September, we opened a flagship store in Milan on Via Montenapoleone establishing a new level of sophistication and glamour. We have always had a strong men's business in Italy and now our women's Collection and accessories have made a tremendous impact," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, adding, "we have set the tone for our European business and we did it in the most fashionable city on the continent." "Last week we launched our new brand, Rugby, in the United States adding another whole new dimension. I have been thinking about a younger customer for several years. Rugby is cooler, hipper and has an attitude. It captures my point of view about heritage and sensibility. It's the new Polo," Mr. Lauren said. "This new success originates from our own creativity. We are forward thinking in our retail and we
have shown our ability to grow within our brands adding new worlds. With the addition of childrens, both at wholesale and retail, we can really take the customer through all ages and sizes." "We are well positioned to execute our global growth strategy. As we expand, we continue to carefully manage our brands to ensure that their integrity and positioning is appropriately maintained," said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. "Our investments in building a strong global platform will be a significant competitive advantage, improving our efficiency and consistency as we continue our domestic and international expansion. These investments in both capital and people are already driving improvements in our wholesale businesses, especially in Europe. And our Lauren by Ralph Lauren and childrenswear businesses are also benefiting. At the same time we continue to improve our specialty retail business where we have seen significant margin improvement in the first half of the year." RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS o We completed the acquisition and successful integration of RL Childrenswear LLC, our former licensee for childrenswear in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We expect Fiscal 2006 revenues to be more than $200 million, with earnings per share to be accretive in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 in Fiscal 2006. o Comparable retail store sales increased 3.7% overall, with a 20 basis point improvement in operating margins. Comparable retail store sales increased 14.2% at Ralph Lauren stores, 4.4% at Club Monaco stores, and 0.2% in our outlet stores. Our store expansion plan is on track with the opening of our Milan flagship store in September, and one Ralph Lauren store and six Club Monaco stores in the United States in the second quarter of Fiscal 2005 and we plan to open six Ralph Lauren stores and three Club Monaco stores in the third quarter of Fiscal 2005. In October we opened our Rugby store in Boston, a new concept store with a full lifestyle collection targeting 18 to 25 year old men and women customers. o We have a strong balance sheet and continue to make excellent progress in managing our inventory levels. At the end of the second quarter, inventory was $444.2 million, including the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren line and childrenswear, compared to $400.7 million at the end of the second quarter last year. We generated a 30% sales increase in wholesale and retail in the second quarter with only an 11% increase in inventory levels due to the inclusion of Lauren and childrenswear. Our inventory turnover improved to 3.6x compared to 3.2x at the end of the second quarter last year. o In October we expanded and extended our existing bank credit facility by entering into a new five-year credit agreement with an expanded syndicate of banks. The new credit agreement, which is substantially on the same terms as the prior credit agreement, increased our revolving line of credit to $450 million, subject to increase to $525 million. The facility is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. o We added to our executive talent when Jacki Nemerov joined the Company in September as Executive Vice President. Jacki has responsibility for the management of our men's, women's and children's wholesales brands, licensed apparel and accessories, and manufacturing. SECOND QUARTER INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW NET REVENUES Net revenues for the second quarter increased 24.9% to $883.7 million compared to $707.8 million in the second quarter last year. Retail sales grew 7.4% to $319.0 million compared to $297.1 million last year, with comparable store sales up 3.7%, primarily driven by our Ralph Lauren stores in the United States and Europe. Our wholesale revenues were $502.6 million, up 49.5% over last year, driven by the inclusion of the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren line and childrenswear in our wholesale segment and increased sales in our European business. Wholesale revenues also reflect a decrease in menswear, as we continue to reposition the Polo brand into more selective department and
specialty stores. Licensing revenues decreased, as planned, due to the absence of royalty income from the previously licensed women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren and childrenswear businesses. The increase in Fiscal 2005 net revenues also reflects the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro to dollar exchange rate. GROSS PROFIT For the second quarter, gross profit was $437.8 million, an increase of $87.2 million, or 24.9%, compared to $350.6 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. The increased gross profit was generated primarily by the addition of the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren line and childrenswear, as well as our European wholesale business. The gross margin rate improved in our specialty retail segment and in our domestic and European wholesale businesses. At 49.5%, our overall gross margin was unchanged from last year, reflecting the above-mentioned reduction in licensing revenue and increase of wholesale versus retail business mix. The increase in Fiscal 2005 gross profit also reflects the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro to dollar exchange rate. SG&A EXPENSES Operating expenses as a percent of revenues were 35.4% this year compared to 37.8% last year. In the second quarter, SG&A expenses were $313.2 million, an increase of $45.6 million or 17.0%, compared to $267.6 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. The rate improvement was achieved by improved infrastructure leverage as well as benefits from our European consolidation. The dollar increase was driven primarily by the change in business mix as a result of expenses associated with the operations of the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren line and childrenswear and also reflects the unfavorable impact of the strengthening Euro to dollar exchange rate. SECOND QUARTER FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES Adjusted results exclude $3.1 million and $1.8 million in foreign currency gains related to certain balance sheet transactions and unhedged inventory purchases in our European operations in the second quarter of Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. Adjusted Fiscal 2005 second quarter results also exclude restructuring charges of $0.9 million related to operational consolidation efforts in Europe primarily associated with severance costs. Management believes that the presentation of results adjusted to exclude these items provides investors with useful information regarding the Company's core business results. STORE COUNT At the end of the second quarter, we operated 270 stores, with 1.92 million square feet, compared to 265 stores, with 1.88 million square feet, at the end of the second quarter last year. Our retail group consisted of 56 Ralph Lauren stores, 66 Club Monaco stores, 123 Polo outlet stores, 20 Polo Jeans Co. outlet stores, and five Club Monaco outlet stores. During the second quarter we opened 11 stores and closed three. EARNINGS OUTLOOK FULL YEAR The Company reiterated that for Fiscal Year 2005 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. These projected results anticipate high-teens percent consolidated revenue growth and approximately 120 basis points improvement in operating margins. The Company expects revenues to reflect mid-thirties percent growth in wholesale sales and high-single digit percent growth in retail revenues, partially offset by a low-double digit percent decrease in licensing revenue as a result of the elimination of the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren and childrenswear license royalties. The Company reiterated that it expects the earnings results of each quarter in Fiscal 2005 to exceed the comparable quarter in Fiscal 2004 with quarterly profit flows similar to Fiscal 2004, with the fourth quarter reflecting the smallest increase due to the impact of a 52-week year in this fiscal year compared to a 53-week year last year. As with the second quarter, we expect to have over 103 million shares outstanding in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2005. The Company expects the consolidated effective tax rate for Fiscal Year 2005 to be 35.6%.
THIRD QUARTER For the third quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company expects consolidated revenues to increase in the low-thirties percent range. We expect that our wholesale revenues will increase in the mid-to-high-seventies percent range reflecting the inclusion of women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren and childrenswear revenues in that segment, as well as improved performance in our domestic menswear and European businesses. Retail revenues are expected to increase in the high-single digit percent range and licensing revenues are expected to decrease in the high-teens percent range reflecting the absence of royalties associated with the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren line and childrenswear license royalties. The Company expects operating margin expansion in both the wholesale and retail businesses, while licensing operating profit is expected to decrease, reflecting the absence of royalties from the women's Lauren by Ralph Lauren and childrenswear lines. The Company expects the consolidated effective tax rate for the third quarter of Fiscal 2005 to be 35.5%. FOURTH QUARTER For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 the Company expects consolidated revenues to increase in the low-single digit percent range. Although the Company expects a slight improvement in wholesale and retail operating margins, it will be offset by a decrease in licensing operating margin, driven by the absence of royalties from childrenswear. The Company expects the consolidated effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005 to be 35.5%.
