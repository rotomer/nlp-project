ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS On March 24, 2005, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's March 2004 orders denying the Company's motion to dismiss Jones Apparel Group, Inc.'s (together with Jones Investment Co., Inc., "Jones") claims against the Company for breach of contract in connection with the termination of the "Lauren" trademark license agreements and granting Jones' motion for summary judgment in the Company's action for declaratory judgment that the Lauren license agreements terminated on December 31, 2003. Jones is seeking $550 million in damages against Polo for Polo's alleged breach of the Lauren license agreements and for allegedly interfering with former Jones employee and current Polo employee Jackwyn Nemerov's employment contract with Jones. The Appellate Division's ruling only related to the Lauren license claim. The issue of damages on the breach of contract claim has not yet been litigated.
