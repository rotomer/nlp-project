ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. On August 19, 2005, Wathne Imports, Ltd. ("Wathne"), Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation's (the "Company") domestic licensee for handbags and luggage, filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, certain of its subsidiaries and Ralph Lauren, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The complaint alleges federal trademark infringements, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract and the obligations of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and negligent misrepresentation relating to the license arrangement and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of $250 million and punitive damages. The Company denies the allegations and intends to seek to have the complaint dismissed. In July 2005, the Company rejected Wathne's proposal that the Company repurchase Wathne's license for approximately $65 million.
