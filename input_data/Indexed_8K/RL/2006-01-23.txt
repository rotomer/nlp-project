"Over the past few years we have been taking more direct control of our brands. Buying back Polo Jeans is a continuation of that long-term strategy and gives us the ability to develop our denim business to its fullest potential," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have the world-class design, marketing and advertising expertise to take this business to the next level as we continue to grow on a global basis." "We already have a strong denim business in Asia and Europe, and with direct ownership of the Polo Jeans business in the United States we will continue to invest in design and infrastructure to leverage our global jeans and denim capabilities," said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. "We have been successful in integrating new merchandise categories and new geographies as we continue to increase our direct ownership on a worldwide basis and this transaction is consistent with that strategic direction."

The transaction is expected to close in early February. UBS Investment Bank acted as financial advisor to Polo Ralph Lauren with respect to this transaction. The Company was advised by the legal firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP.
