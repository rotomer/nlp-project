ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On January 31, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (the "Company") adopted amendments to the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"). The amendments provide that the Compensation Committee may grant discretionary employer contributions to eligible employees in such amounts as the Committee may designate from time to time on an individual basis, including otherwise eligible employees who did not previously participate in the SERP as a result of the plan being closed to new participants as of September 30, 2004. The amendments also made certain conforming technical changes to the SERP. The Committee also approved the restatement of the SERP to reflect all amendments to date. Participants in the SERP have interest bearing accounts that are credited with annual employer contributions of 5% of their base compensation. Participants' accounts are subject to vesting. Officers and other highly compensated managerial employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible for designation by the Committee for participation in the SERP; provided, however, that employees who were not participants in the SERP as of September 30, 2004 may receive only such discretionary contributions as the Committee may award in its discretion. 2
