Together we have built a powerful presence that combines creativity and commerce in a virtual flagship store," said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Polo Ralph Lauren. "We are excited about our complete ownership of Polo.com as we look to grow and elevate our e-commerce presence on a worldwide basis." "This is a very successful and growing business that has become an important part of our domestic retail shopping experience. This transaction allows us to fully integrate the operations of Polo.com into our existing organization and leverage our operational expertise to maximize the online sales performance and financial contribution to our company," said Roger Farah, Polo's President and Chief Operating Officer.
