Polo Ralph Lauren Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2008 Results
 
 
New York (February 6, 2008)  Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today reported net income of $113 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2008, compared to net income of $111 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2007. The reported results include the net dilutive impact associated with recent acquisitions, including non-cash amortization of $16 million, as well as a lower effective tax rate. The lower effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the resolution of discrete tax items that occurred within the quarter.
 
Net income for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 declined 3% to $316 million, compared to $328 million in the comparable period last fiscal year. Net income per diluted share decreased 2% to $2.99 per share from $3.04 per share in the first nine months last year. These results also reflect the net dilutive impact related to the recent acquisitions, including non-cash amortization of $45 million, as well as a lower effective tax rate.
 
Our Company offers the highest quality, aspirational merchandise across the entire consumer spectrum, from the pinnacle of luxury with Ralph Lauren Collection and Purple Label to the American Living brand in our Global Brand Concepts group. The diversity of our brand portfolio, the strength of our lifestyle positioning, the talent of our creative and managerial teams and our increasingly global reach are enviable assets that position us well for long-term growth, said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We believe this provides us with a competitive advantage as we navigate through volatile times, allowing us to maintain the strategic focus that has served us so well over the last forty years, Mr. Lauren added.
 
We delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date results. Even in the context of macroeconomic uncertainty, our strategies remain intact, said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. In the past few years we have made significant long-term investments in our international business with the expansion of Europe, product categories such as Lauren and Childrenswear, and channel expansion with our own Retail stores and eCommerce, as well as infrastructure investments to develop a world-class supply chain. Our more recent efforts include the repositioning of Japan and the development of accessories. While the recent decline in consumer spending presents near-term challenges, we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives as we believe they are long-term drivers of shareholder value.

Third Quarter and Nine Months Fiscal 2008 Income Statement Review
 
Net Revenues.
Net revenues for the third quarter increased 11% to $1.27 billion, compared to $1.14 billion for the comparable period last year. Excluding the impact of recent non-comp acquisitions (Impact 21 Co., Ltd. (Impact 21), a former Japanese sub-licensee and the remaining interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation as well as New Campaign, Inc. (New Campaign), the Companys former small leathergoods licensee in the U.S.), third quarter net revenues increased 6%.
 
Net revenues for the first nine months grew 11% to $3.64 billion from $3.26 billion in the comparable period of Fiscal 2007. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, net revenues for the first nine months of the fiscal year increased by 7%.
 
 
For the first nine months of the fiscal year, wholesale sales increased 17% to $1.97 billion from $1.69 billion in the comparable period of Fiscal 2007. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, wholesale sales were up 6%, primarily driven by Europe, menswear and Chaps. Shipments to support the American Living launch as discussed above also contributed to wholesale sales growth for the year-to-date period.
 
 
Retail sales in the first nine months were up 8% to $1.51 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the same period last fiscal year, reflecting strong comparable store sales. Total comparable store sales for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 were up 6.4%, comprised of a 7.2% increase at Ralph Lauren stores, 6.4% at factory stores and 4.1% at Club Monaco stores. RalphLauren.com sales grew 24% over the comparable nine month period last year.

Licensing royalties in the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 were down 14% to $154 million compared to $180 million in the comparable period last year. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, licensing revenue increased 2%, as higher eyewear, fragrance and Chaps royalties offset the impact related to last years receipt of a one-time accelerated payment to exit a licensing arrangement as discussed above.
 
Gross Profit.
Gross profit for the third quarter increased 10% to $677 million, compared to $614 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007. On a reported basis, the gross profit rate declined 40 basis points to 53.3%, compared to 53.7% during the same period last year, due to the effect of recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, the gross profit rate was 20 basis points higher than the comparable period last year, as the benefit of higher European sales offset increased promotional activity in certain of our domestic businesses.
 
Gross profit for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 increased 10% to $1.96 billion compared to $1.78 billion in the comparable period last year. Gross profit rate for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 was 54.0%, 50 basis points below the prior year, primarily due to the effect of recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 increased 50 basis points from the comparable period last year, primarily due to higher European sales and partially offset by increased promotional activity in certain of our domestic businesses.
 
Operating Expenses.
Operating expenses increased 18% in the third quarter to $506 million, compared to $430 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2007. On a reported basis, expenses as a percent of revenues were 39.8%, 220 basis points higher than last year, as a result of the non-cash effect of purchase accounting, operating expenses at newly acquired businesses and higher stock-based compensation costs.
 
Operating expenses in the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 increased 17% to $1.45 billion from $1.25 billion in the year-earlier period. On a reported basis, the operating expense margin was 40.0%, 180 basis points higher than the first nine months of Fiscal 2007, as a result of the non-cash effect of purchase accounting, operating expenses at newly acquired businesses and higher stock-based compensation costs.
 
Operating Income.
Operating income for the third quarter declined 7% to $171 million, compared to $184 million for the third quarter last year. Approximately $16 million of the decline in operating income reflects higher non-cash amortization of intangible assets and inventory related to purchase accounting for the recent acquisitions. On a reported basis, the operating margin was 13.4%, compared to 16.1% in the third quarter last year. The 270 basis point decrease in the operating margin was primarily due to the effect of purchase accounting related to the recent acquisitions, investment in business expansion and higher stock-based compensation costs.

For the first nine months of Fiscal 2008, operating income declined 4% to $509 million compared to $533 million in the first nine months of Fiscal 2007. Higher non-cash amortization of intangible assets and inventory related to purchase accounting for the recent acquisitions reduced reported operating income by $45 million for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008. Operating margin decreased 230 basis points to 14.0% for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 from 16.3% last year, primarily due to the effect of purchase accounting related to the recent acquisitions, an increase in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses due to business expansion and higher stock-based compensation costs.
 
 
Wholesale operating income increased 14% in the first nine months to $388 million, compared to $339 million in the comparable period last year. Wholesale operating margin for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 was 19.7%, 40 basis points below the 20.1% reported for the first nine months last year. Excluding the full impact of recent acquisitions, wholesale operating income would have grown 10% to $373 million and the wholesale operating margin would have expanded 80 basis points to 20.9%.
 
 
Retail operating income declined 7% in the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 to $210 million compared to $226 million in the year-earlier period, and the retail operating margin was 13.9%, 230 basis points below the 16.2% achieved in the first nine months of Fiscal 2007. The year-over-year declines primarily reflect the non-cash effect of purchase accounting associated with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Ralph Lauren Media we did not already own, increased occupancy costs associated with future store openings, as well as higher markdown activity. Excluding the impact of the Ralph Lauren Media acquisition, retail operating income declined 3% and the retail operating margin was down 160 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the first nine months of Fiscal 2008.

Licensing operating income for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 declined 34% to $70 million compared to $106 million in the year-earlier period. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and even with the receipt of a one-time accelerated payment to exit a licensing arrangement in the comparable period last year, licensing operating income increased 6% in the first nine months of Fiscal 2008.
 
Net Income and Diluted EPS.
Net income for the third quarter of Fiscal 2008 increased 2% to $113 million, compared to $111 million last year. Net income per diluted share increased 5% to $1.08 per share from $1.03 last year. The growth in net income and diluted EPS results principally relates to an effective tax rate of 31.1% in the third quarter of Fiscal 2008 compared to a 38.9% rate in the comparable period last year, which more than offset the decline in operating income as discussed above. The lower effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the resolution of discrete tax items that were partially offset by the higher tax expense associated with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48).
 
Net income for the first nine months of Fiscal 2008 declined 3% to $316 million, compared to $328 million last year. Net income per diluted share decreased 2% to $2.99 per share from $3.04 last year. The decline in net income and diluted EPS results principally relates to the lower operating income as discussed above, including non-cash amortization related to purchase accounting for the recent acquisitions, which was partially mitigated by a lower tax rate of 36.6%, 70 basis points below than the prior year, as discussed above.
 
Third Quarter Fiscal 2008 Balance Sheet Review
 
The third quarter ended with $804 million in cash, or $186 million in cash net of debt (net cash), compared to $564 million in cash and $165 million of net cash at the end of Fiscal 2007. The third quarter ended with inventory up 20% to $581 million from $484 million in the third quarter of last year, including inventory associated with the recent acquisitions, as well as inventory received to support the American Living launch in February 2008.
 
The Company did not repurchase any shares of class A common stock during the third quarter and has approximately $298 million remaining under its share repurchase

program. The Company had $59 million in capital expenditures in the third quarter, compared to $40 million in the prior year period.
 
Global Retail Store Network
 
During the quarter, the Company opened seven directly operated stores and did not close any directly operated stores. Over the last twelve months, the Company has opened 29 directly operated stores and closed 19 directly operated stores.
 
At the end of the third quarter, the Company operated 309 stores with a total of approximately 2.4 million square feet compared to 299 stores with approximately 2.3 million square feet in the prior year. The current retail group consists of 79 Ralph Lauren stores, 65 Club Monaco stores, 155 Polo factory stores and 10 Rugby stores. In addition, at the end of the third quarter, international licensing partners operated 91 Ralph Lauren stores and 46 Club Monaco stores and dedicated shops.
 
Fiscal 2008 Full Year Outlook
 
The Company now expects revenues for Fiscal 2008 to increase by a low double digit percentage, operating margins to decline by approximately 250 basis points and Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share to be at the lower end of the range of $3.64 to $3.74 compared to a prior expectation of $3.50 to $3.60. The higher earnings per share guidance is entirely a function of the impact of the third quarters discrete tax items on the full years lower effective tax rate. The full year diluted earnings per share guidance includes both the full impact of the recent acquisitions as well as the adoption of FIN 48, as previously discussed.
 
Initial Fiscal 2009 Full Year Outlook
 
The Company currently expects consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2009 to increase by a low-to-mid single digit percentage. The full year tax rate is estimated at 38% and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 106 million for the full fiscal year. The Companys preliminary estimate for diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2009 is $3.95-$4.05.
