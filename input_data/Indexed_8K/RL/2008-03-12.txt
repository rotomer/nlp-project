On March 7, 2008, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (the "Company") notified Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte & Touche") that it had determined to dismiss Deloitte & Touche as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of the date of the completion of the audit services conducted by Deloitte & Touche for the fiscal year ending March 29, 2008. Upon completion of the audit services conducted by Deloitte & Touche for such fiscal year, the Company will file an amendment to this Form 8-K with the specific date of dismissal of Deloitte & Touche and an update of the disclosures required by Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and (v) of Regulation S-K through such date.
 
During the Company's two fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006, and the subsequent interim period through March 7, 2008, there were no disagreements between the Company and Deloitte & Touche on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure that, if not resolved to Deloitte & Touche's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the matter in conjunction with its report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the relevant year and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
Deloitte & Touche's audit report dated May 30, 2007 (which was included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on May 30, 2007) on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the two fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles except that the audit report included an explanatory paragraph related to the Company's elected application of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" effective April 2, 2006 and the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," as revised, effective April 2, 2006.
 
During the Company's two fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006, and the subsequent interim period through March 7, 2008, there were no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and (v) of Regulation S-K), except that as of April 1, 2006, Deloitte & Touche's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting contained an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting due to the existence of a material weakness related to income tax accounting as disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on June 15, 2006.
 
The Company furnished a copy of the above disclosures to Deloitte & Touche and requested that Deloitte & Touche provide a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made above. A copy of such letter is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
 
Also on March 7, 2008, the Audit Committee notified Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") that it would engage Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm commencing with the fiscal year ending March 28, 2009.
 
During the Company's two fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006, and through March 7, 2008, neither the Company, nor anyone acting on its behalf, consulted with Ernst & Young with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's
 
 
 
consolidated financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided by Ernst & Young to the Company that Ernst & Young concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue or (ii) any matter that was the subject of either a disagreement as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
