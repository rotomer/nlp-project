As disclosed in the Form 8-K, the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young) as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm commencing with the fiscal year ending March 28, 2009.
On March 7, 2008, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company notified Deloitte & Touche that it had determined to dismiss Deloitte & Touche as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of the date of the completion of the audit services conducted by Deloitte & Touche for the fiscal year ending March 29, 2008. The dismissal of Deloitte & Touche became effective on May 28, 2008.

Deloitte & Touches audit report dated May 28, 2008 (which was included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on May 28, 2008) on the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the two fiscal years ended March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles except that the audit report included an explanatory paragraph related to the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, effective April 1, 2007, the Companys elected application of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements effective April 2, 2006 and the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, as revised, effective April 2, 2006.
