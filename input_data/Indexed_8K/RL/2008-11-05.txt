Polo Ralph Lauren Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2009 Results
 
 
New York -- (BUSINESS WIRE)  November 5, 2008Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation today reported net income of $161 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2009, compared to net income of $115 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for the second quarter of Fiscal 2008. The second quarter results reflect a 10% increase in net revenues, operating income growth of 26% and a 40% increase in net income, which includes the benefit of a lower effective tax rate compared to the prior year period.
 
Net income for the first six months of Fiscal 2009 increased 26% to $256 million, compared to $204 million in the comparable period last fiscal year. The growth in net income for the year-to-date period reflects a 7% increase in net revenues, operating income that is 15% greater than the prior year period and a lower effective tax rate. Net income per diluted share increased 31% to $2.51 from $1.92 in the first six months last year.
 
Our strong performance for the first six months of the year confirms that we are on the right strategic course, said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. While global uncertainty is a reality that we will likely be living with for some time, the desirability of our brand and products continues to expand worldwide. Our business has endured through good times and bad over the last forty years and weve always emerged stronger from any challenge, Mr. Lauren added.
 
I am proud of our year-to-date operating results, which have exceeded our expectations, said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer. The domestic retail environment has been challenging for the last year. Those challenges have begun to materialize around the world and they have intensified recently, creating an environment of unprecedented volatility. Nevertheless, we remain committed to our long-term strategic growth initiatives, which are supported by the strength of our balance sheet and world-class global management capabilities.
 
Second Quarter and First Half Fiscal 2009 Income Statement Review
 
Net Revenues
. Net revenues for the second quarter increased 10% to $1.43 billion, compared to $1.30 billion for the comparable period last year. The higher net revenues primarily reflect shipments of new products, growth in global retail sales and higher European wholesale revenues.
 
 
 
First half net revenues grew 7% to $2.54 billion from $2.37 billion in the comparable period of Fiscal 2008. The growth in net revenues is primarily attributable to shipments of new products, global retail sales growth and higher European wholesale sales.
 
 
For the first six months of the fiscal year, wholesale sales increased 6% to $1.42 billion from $1.35 billion in the first half of Fiscal 2008. The year-over-year increase in wholesale revenue is attributable to new product shipments and higher European sales that more than offset a decline in domestic shipments of our core mens, womens and childrenswear products.
 
 
Retail sales in the first half were up 11% to $1.02 billion compared to $924 million in the first half last fiscal year, reflecting comparable store sales growth and revenues from new stores. Total comparable store sales for the first half of Fiscal 2009 were up 4.6%, comprised of a 3.1% increase at Ralph Lauren stores, 5.9% at factory stores and a 0.3% decline at Club Monaco. RalphLauren.com sales grew 25% over the comparable six month period last year.
 
 
Licensing royalties in the first half were down 1% to $99 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period as new product licenses and growth in domestic Polo mens underwear were offset by a decline in Japanese product licensing royalties associated with the Company assuming direct control of certain product categories in Japan.
 
Gross Profit.
Gross profit for the second quarter increased 13% to $788 million, compared to $695 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2008. The gross profit rate increased 170 basis points to 55.2%, compared to 53.5% during the same period last year. The growth in gross profit and the expansion in gross profit rate reflect the higher sales
mentioned previously, the decline in purchase accounting amortization from last years acquisitions and stronger margins for many of our core apparel products.
 
 
 
 
Gross profit for the first half of Fiscal 2009 increased 11% to $1.43 billion compared to $1.29 billion in the comparable period last year. First half gross profit margin of 56.1% was 180 basis points greater than the prior year, primarily due to higher international sales, a decline in purchase price amortization associated with last years acquisitions and stronger margins for many of our core apparel products.
 
Operating Expenses.
Operating expenses increased 8% in the second quarter to $545 million, compared to $503 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2008. Operating expenses as a percent of revenues were 38.2%, 50 basis points below last year, primarily due to revenue growth and lower purchase accounting amortization that was partially offset by operating expenses at newly acquired and emerging businesses and occupancy costs for unopened stores.
 
Operating expenses in the first half of Fiscal 2009 increased 9% to $1.04 billion from $949 million in the year-earlier period. Operating expense margin was 40.8%, 80 basis points greater than that of the first half of Fiscal 2008, primarily due to operating expenses at newly acquired and emerging businesses as well as occupancy costs for unopened stores that more than offset the benefit of higher sales and lower purchase accounting amortization.
 
Operating Income.
Operating income for the second quarter rose 26% to $243 million, compared to $193 million for the second quarter last year. The operating margin was 17.0%, compared to 14.8% in the second quarter last year, representing a 220 basis point improvement, primarily due to lower purchase accounting amortization, the profit contribution from new products and leverage on unallocated corporate expenses.
 
For the first half of Fiscal 2009, operating income increased 15% to $390 million compared to $338 million in the first half of Fiscal 2008. Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 15.3% for the first half of Fiscal 2009 from 14.3% last year, primarily due to lower purchase accounting amortization compared to the prior year period, the profit contribution from new products and leverage on unallocated corporate expenses.
 
 
Wholesale operating income increased 13% in the first half to $319 million compared to $283 million in the first half last year. Wholesale operating margin for the first half of Fiscal 2009 was 22.5%, 140 basis points greater than the 21.1% reported for the first half last year, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower purchase accounting amortization that was partially offset by expenses at newly acquired and emerging businesses.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Retail operating income increased 7% in the first half to $125 million compared to $116 million in the year-earlier period, and the retail operating margin was 12.2%, 30 basis points below the 12.5% achieved in the first half of Fiscal 2008. The year-over-year decline in the retail operating margin rate is a function of occupancy costs associated with large-scale future store openings and impairment charges relating to certain retail store assets that were partially offset by lower purchase price amortization associated with Ralph Lauren Media.
 
 
First half licensing operating income increased 14% to $51 million compared to $45 million in the year-earlier period. Stronger domestic product licensing revenues and a decline in purchase accounting amortization were partially offset by lower home licensing and Japanese product licensing royalties associated with the Company assuming direct control of certain product categories in Japan.
 
Net Income and Diluted EPS.
Net income for the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 grew 40% to $161 million, compared to $115 million last year. Net income per diluted share rose 45% to $1.58 per share from $1.09 last year. The growth in net income and diluted EPS results principally relates to the increase in operating income and to an effective tax rate of 34.2%, 520 basis points below the prior year.
 
Net income for the first six months of Fiscal 2009 increased 26% to $256 million, compared to $204 million last year. Net income per diluted share rose 31% to $2.51 per share from $1.92 last year. The higher net income and diluted EPS results principally relate to the increased operating income as discussed above and to an effective tax rate of 34.4%, 490 basis points below the prior year.
 
 
 
The lower effective tax rate for both the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2009 was primarily a result of lower income taxes principally relating to statutory law changes, favorable geographic income mix and the resolution of discrete tax items.
 
Second Quarter Fiscal 2008 Balance Sheet Review
 
The Company ended the second quarter with $510 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, or $71 million in cash and short-term investments net of debt (net cash), compared to $626 million in cash and short-term investments and $53 million of debt net of cash and short-term investments at the end of Fiscal 2008. The Companys net cash position reflects strong growth in operating cash flow that was partially offset by stock repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisition spending, including the repayment of a short-term loan to finance last years Japanese acquisitions. The Companys return on equity for the last twelve month period ending with the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 was 21% and its return on investment was 29% for the same time frame.
 
During the second quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of Class A Common Stock totaling $118 million and has approximately $266 million remaining under its share repurchase programs. The Company had $29 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter, compared to $48 million in the prior year period. The second quarter ended with inventory down 3% to $619 million from $636 million in the second quarter of last year. Excluding inventory associated with non-comparable new businesses, the second quarter ended with inventory down 8% compared to the prior year period.
 
Global Retail Store Network
 
During the second quarter, the Company opened 12 directly operated stores and closed one directly operated store. Over the last twelve months, the Company has opened 31 directly operated stores and closed 5 directly operated stores.
 
At the end of the second quarter, the Company operated 328 stores with a total of approximately 2.5 million square feet compared to 302 stores with approximately 2.3 million square feet in the prior year. The current retail group consists of 85 Ralph Lauren stores, 69 Club Monaco stores, 162 Polo factory stores and 12 Rugby stores. In addition, at the end of the second quarter, international licensing partners operated 96 Ralph Lauren stores and 59 Club Monaco stores and dedicated shops.
 
Fiscal 2009 Full Year Outlook
 
The Company expects a low single digit increase in net revenues during Fiscal 2009, which compares to prior guidance for low-to-mid single digit net revenue growth. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2009 is expected to be approximately 35.5%. The Companys estimate for diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2009 remains $4.00-$4.10.
