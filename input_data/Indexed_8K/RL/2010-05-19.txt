Polo Ralph Lauren Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2010 Results
 
 
New York (May 19, 2010)  Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today reported net income of $114 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, compared to net income of $45 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.  Net income for Fiscal 2010 was $480 million, or $4.73 per diluted share, compared to net income of $406 million, or $4.01 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2009.
 
Results for the fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2010 periods included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in Fiscal 2009 included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively.  The 53 week contributed approximately $70 million to fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2010 net revenues.  Results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 include a $48 million pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge associated with store-related assets and a $21 million pre-tax restructuring charge.  Excluding these one-time charges, net income in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 would have been $87 million and net income per diluted share would have been $0.86.  Similarly, excluding $55 million of pre-tax, non- cash impairment charges and $24 million of pre-tax restructuring charges, net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2009 would have been $4.50.

Fiscal 2010 was a year of tremendous growth and progress for our Company, said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  We successfully took control of our important Asian operations, we made great strides in the development of our accessories products and we opened several luxury stores in key global markets.  We achieved record earnings for the year in the context of the worst financial recession in my lifetime, a feat that not only speaks to the desirability of our products, the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts and the relevance of our strategy, but also to the incredible dedication and hard work of our employees worldwide.  Having traveled around the world over the last few months, I am inspired by what the future holds for u s, Mr. Lauren added.
 
Our fourth quarter and full year results exceeded our expectations on virtually all operating metrics.  The resilient sales and strong profit performance are the direct result of years of consistent reinvestment in our business and intensely disciplined operational management, said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer.  After generating more than $900 million in cash from operating activities last year, and with more than $1.2 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, we are planning an aggressive acceleration of our investment in our growth initiatives during Fiscal 2011, particularly in international markets and with our direct to consumer efforts.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2010 Income Statement Review
 
Given the importance and prevalence of the concession shop model in the Companys anticipated Asian expansion plans, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company determined it appropriate to reclassify $198 million of net revenues and $8 million of operating income for the full fiscal year period to the retail segment from the wholesale segment.  The reclassification applies to the Companys Japanese concession shop operations and reflects the direct selling, expense and inventory ownership dynamics of the concession shop model.  Prior period results have been restated to reflect the reclassification, which has no impact on previously reported consolidated net revenues, operating income or net income figures.  A reconciliation of the reclassification is provided in the Other Information section of this press release.
 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 9% to $1.3 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.  The higher net revenues primarily reflect strong comparable store sales growth at the Companys retail segment, the benefit of a 53 week of sales and incremental revenues from newly transitioned Asian operations that were partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale revenues.
Net Revenues.
 
rd
 
Net revenues for the full year Fiscal 2010 period declined 1% to $5.0 billion.  The decline in net revenues primarily reflects lower global wholesale shipment volumes that were partially offset by higher retail segment sales.
 
Excluding the 53 week, net revenues for the fourth quarter would have risen 3% and net revenues for Fiscal 2010 would have declined 2%.
rd
 
 
For Fiscal 2010, wholesale revenues were $2.5 billion, 8% below Fiscal 2009.  Lower global apparel shipment volumes, particularly in the United States, were partially offset by the incremental benefit of Japanese childrenswear and golf apparel sales in the first half of the year and higher footwear sales.

Retail sales for Fiscal 2010 were up 9% to $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in Fiscal 2009, reflecting higher comparable store sales at the Companys international freestanding stores, growth at RalphLauren.com and the contribution from newly assumed Asian stores and concession shops that more than offset a reduction in comparable store sales at domestic freestanding stores.  Total comparable store sales for Fiscal 2010, which are presented on a 52-week to 52-week basis and include reclassified Japanese concession shops, rose 1%, comprised of a 4% reduction at Ralph Lauren stores, a 1% increase at factory stores and 2% growth at Club Monaco stores.  RalphLauren.com sales grew 18% in Fiscal 2010.
 
 
Licensing royalties for Fiscal 2010 declined 6% to $183 million from $195 million in Fiscal 2009.  Lower international licensing revenues related to the transition of certain Asian licenses and declines in fragrance and home licensing revenues more than offset higher domestic product licensing revenues.
 
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 increased 24% to $789 million from $634 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 and the gross profit rate rose 720 basis points to an all-time high of 59.0%. The substantial expansion in gross profit rate reflects improved wholesale and retail segment margins, and was primarily driven by disciplined inventory management that led to reduced markdowns in our retail stores, improved product mix across all channels and continued savings from supply chain initiatives.
Gross Profit.  
 
Gross profit for Fiscal 2010 increased 6% to $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion in Fiscal 2009.  The gross profit rate for Fiscal 2010 was 58.2%, 380 basis points greater than the prior year and a record level for a fiscal year period, reflecting improved wholesale and retail segment margins.  Disciplined inventory management, which reduced markdowns in our retail stores, improved product mix across all channels and savings from sourcing and supply chain initiatives all contributed to gross margin expansion in Fiscal 2010.
 
Operating expenses increased 4% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 to $618 million from $595 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.  Operating expense margin was 46.2%, 240 basis points below the prior year period, which included $69 million of impairment and restructuring charges.  The growth in operating expenses reflects incremental expenses associated with business expansion and higher incentive compensation costs.
Operating Expenses.

Operating expenses for Fiscal 2010 were $2.2 billion, 3% greater than Fiscal 2009. Operating expense margin was 44.0%, 150 basis points greater than Fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower sales, higher incentive compensation costs and incremental expenses associated with business expansion that were partially offset by lower advertising expense and Company-wide cost savings initiatives.
 
  Operating income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 increased 335% to $172 million from $40 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 and the operating margin rose 960 basis points to 12.8%.  The improvement in operating income and margin rate is primarily attributable to the improved gross profit rate and to lower impairment and restructuring charges.
Operating Income.
 
Fiscal 2010s operating income of $707 million was 19% greater than Fiscal 2009 and the operating margin increased 230 basis points to 14.2%.  The growth in operating income and expansion of the operating margin reflects the higher gross profit rate and lower impairment and restructuring charges that were partially offset by incremental expenses associated with business expansion.
 
 
Wholesale operating income declined 6% in Fiscal 2010 to $585 million from $620 million in Fiscal 2009.  Wholesale operating margin for Fiscal 2010 was 23.1%, 60 basis points greater than the 22.5% reported for Fiscal 2009.  The higher wholesale operating margin rate is primarily attributable to improved wholesale segment gross profit rate and disciplined expense management that was partially offset by expenses associated with business expansion.
 
 
Retail operating income increased 150% in Fiscal 2010 to $254 million from $102 million in Fiscal 2009, and retail operating margin was 11.2% compared to 4.9% in the prior year period.  The growth in retail operating income and the expansion in margin rate is a result of broad-based profit improvement across most retail concepts worldwide, primarily due to positive comparable store sales growth, higher full-price sales and disciplined inventory and operational management.  Lower impairment charges also contributed to Fiscal 2010s improvement in retail segment operating income and margin rate.  The improvement was partially offset by expenses related to newly assumed Asian operations.

Fiscal 2010 licensing operating income increased 4% to $107 million from $104 million in Fiscal 2009.  The improvement in licensing operating income reflects lower net costs due to the transition of formerly licensed Asian operations and higher domestic product licensing income that was partially offset by lower home licensing royalties.
 
  Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 increased 156% to $114 million from $45 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, and net income per diluted share increased 157% to $1.13 per share from $0.44 for the same time period.  The substantial growth in net income and net income per diluted share principally relates to the higher operating income discussed above that was partially offset by higher taxes compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, when the Company had a net tax benefit.
Net Income and Diluted EPS.
 
Net income for Fiscal 2010 increased 18% to $480 million from $406 million in Fiscal 2009.  Net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2010 was $4.73, compared to $4.01 in Fiscal 2009.  The growth in net income and net income per diluted share is a function of the higher operating income discussed above.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2010 Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Review
 
The Company ended Fiscal 2010 with $1.2 billion in cash and investments, a 44% increase from the $850 million in cash and investments at the end of Fiscal 2009.  Cash and investments net of debt (net cash) was $941 million at the end of Fiscal 2010, more than double the $443 million of net cash at the end of Fiscal 2009.  The fourth quarter ended with inventory down 4% to $504 million from $525 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.  In Fiscal 2010, the Companys return on equity was 18% and its return on investment was 33%.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2010 was $907 million, 17% greater than Fiscal 2009, reflecting higher net income and improved working capital management.  The Company had $201 million in capital expenditures in Fiscal 2010, compared to $185 million in the prior year period.  During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased one million shares of Class A Common Stock, utilizing approximately $78 million of its authorized share repurchase programs.

In addition to Company-operated locations, international licensing partners operated 63 Ralph Lauren stores and 60 Club Monaco stores and dedicated shops at the end of the fourth quarter.
 
Fiscal 2011 Outlook
 
In the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, the Company expects consolidated revenues to increase at a low double digit rate, including a net unfavorable foreign currency translation effect.  Wholesale revenues are expected to grow at a low double digit rate in the first quarter and comparable store sales are projected to increase by a high single digit rate. The Company expects the operating margin rate for the first quarter of Fiscal 2011 to be modestly above that in the comparable prior year period.
 
Fiscal 2011 is a 52-week period and compares to a 53-week duration for Fiscal 2010.  The Company currently expects consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2011 to increase by a mid single digit percentage, including a net unfavorable foreign currency translation effect. Based on an acceleration of its investment in international expansion and direct-to-consumer operations, the Company expects a low double digit operating margin rate for Fiscal 2011.  The full year Fiscal 2011 tax rate is estimated at 34%.  Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $280 million in Fiscal 2011.

Polo Ralph Lauren is a global company that reports its financial information in U.S. dollars, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars because the underlying currencies in which the Company transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results. As a supplement to its reported operating results, the Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of opera ting results and better identify trends in its businesses. These constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Companys operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
