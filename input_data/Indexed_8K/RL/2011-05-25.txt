Exhibit 99.1
 
Polo Ralph Lauren Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2011 Results
New York (May 25, 2011)  Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today reported net income of $73 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, compared to net income of $114 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.  Net income for Fiscal 2011 was $568 million, or $5.75 per diluted share, compared to net income of $480 million, or $4.73 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2010.
Results for the fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2011 periods included 13 and 52 weeks, respectively, while the same periods in Fiscal 2010 included 14 and 53 weeks, respectively.  The 53 week contributed approximately $70 million to fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2010 net revenues and approximately $0.13 in earnings per diluted share for the same periods.  As expected, other calendar shifts, including the timing of Easter and the week between Christmas and the New Year, impact the comparability of reported sales and profit results with the prior year period.
rd
We reported record sales and earnings in Fiscal 2011 while strengthening our foundation for powerful long-term growth, said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  During the year, we opened important flagship stores in some of the worlds premier cities.  These stores showcase our luxury lifestyle sensibility and reinforce the clarity and consistency of our brand expression to the most discerning customers.  We also completed the last stage of acquiring our Asian operations, and we are redefining how our brand is presented in this important region of the world.  Assuming more direct control of our operations around the world and extending our brands into exciting new merchandise categories has enabled us to generate strong, consistent returns for our shareholders.  As we look to the future, the scope of our opportunities across products, channels and geographies is incredibly invigorating, Mr. Lauren added.
Our full year results were much better than we expected, reflecting the incredible momentum of the Ralph Lauren brand around the world, said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer.  Strong underlying trends continued in the fourth quarter, although several calendar shifts distort comparability with the prior year period. We enter Fiscal 2012 with excellent momentum in our core operations and a unique opportunity to accelerate investment in our most compelling long-term growth initiatives, particularly in international markets.  Even though we face real sourcing cost pressure during the year and the impact of impending inflationary pressure on the consumer is unknown, our brands are strong and we have a culture of tremendous operational discipline.  We remain

steadfast with our proven strategy of consistent investment in our growth initiatives to support long-term shareholder value creation.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2011 Income Statement Review
Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2011 results reflects 13 and 52 weeks of operations, respectively, compared to 14 and 53 weeks of operations in the respective fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2010 periods. Retail segment comparable store sales are presented on a 13/13 and 52/52 week basis for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year periods.
Net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 7% to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.  The higher net revenues primarily reflect double-digit sales growth at the Companys retail segment, including high single-digit comparable store sales growth and incremental revenues from newly transitioned South Korean operations.
Net Revenues.
 
Net revenues for the full year Fiscal 2011 period increased 14% to $5.7 billion.  The growth in net revenues reflects strong retail segment expansion including incremental revenues from newly transitioned Asian operations and low double-digit comparable store sales growth, in addition to a low double-digit increase in global wholesale shipments.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 increased 3% to $810 million from $789 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.  Gross profit margin was 56.8%, 220 basis points below the prior year level. The decline in gross profit margin reflects the impact of cost of goods inflation that was partially offset by improved retail segment margins and overall channel mix.
Gross Profit.  
Gross profit for Fiscal 2011 increased 14% to $3.3 billion compared to $2.9 billion in Fiscal 2010.  The gross profit margin for Fiscal 2010 was 58.6%, 40 basis points greater than the prior year and a new record level for a fiscal year period.  The expansion in gross profit margin was primarily due to improved retail segment margins and overall channel mix that was partially offset by cost of goods inflation in the second half of Fiscal 2011.
Operating expenses increased 12% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 to $693 million from $618 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.  Operating expense margin was 48.6%, 240 basis points above the prior year period.  The higher operating expense margin primarily reflects incremental costs associated with assuming full control of South Korean operations, continued investment in the Companys strategic growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation costs.
Operating Expenses.  
Operating expenses for Fiscal 2011 were $2.5 billion, 13% greater than Fiscal 2010. Operating expense margin was 43.7%, 30 basis points below Fiscal 2010, as strong sales growth and continued expense discipline more than offset incremental costs associated with newly transitioned Asian operations and continued investment in the Companys strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure.
  Operating income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 was $117 million and the operating margin was 8.2%, which compares to operating income of $172 million and an operating margin of 12.8% in the prior year period.  The lower operating income and margin rate are primarily attributable to the lower gross profit margin and to higher expenses associated with newly transitioned operations and business expansion.
Operating Income.

Fiscal 2011s operating income of $845 million was 20% greater than Fiscal 2010 and the operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.9%.  The growth in operating income and higher operating margin reflect double-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management that more than offset incremental expenses associated with newly transitioned operations and business expansion.

  Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 was $73 million compared to $114 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, and net income per diluted share was $0.74 compared to $1.13 in the prior year period.  The decline in net income and net income per diluted share principally relate to the calendar shifts and lower operating income discussed above. In addition, the Company had an effective tax rate of 34% compared to 32% in the prior year period, primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings being generated in higher taxed jurisdictions during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.
Net Income and Diluted EPS.
 
Net income for Fiscal 2011 increased 18% to $568 million from $480 million in Fiscal 2010.  Net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2011 was $5.75, 22% greater than the $4.73 earned in Fiscal 2010.  The growth in net income and net income per diluted share is principally due to the higher operating income discussed above, which was partially offset by calendar shifts and a higher effective tax rate, as a greater proportion of earnings were generated in higher taxed jurisdictions during Fiscal 2011.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2011 Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Review
The Company ended Fiscal 2011 with $1.1 billion in cash and investments compared to $1.2 billion in cash and investments at the end of Fiscal 2010.  Cash and investments net of debt (net cash) was $839 million at the end of Fiscal 2011 compared to $941 million of net cash at the end of Fiscal 2010.  The fourth quarter ended with inventory up 39% to $702 million from $504 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010. The higher inventory primarily reflects an investment to support anticipated sales growth, including the early receipt of goods to support expanded strategic merchandising programs; incremental inventory to support new stores and concession shops, including newly transitioned Asian operations; and the inflationary and foreign exchange impact on cost of goods.
The Company had $255 million in capital expenditures in Fiscal 2011, compared to $201 million in the prior year period.  During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased two million shares of Class A Common Stock, utilizing approximately $247 million of its authorized share repurchase programs.  During Fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased approximately six million shares of Class A Common Stock, utilizing approximately $578 million of its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company has approximately $972 million remaining under its authorized share repurchase programs, inclusive of a new $500 million authorization recently approved by the Company's Board of Directors.
Global Retail Store Network
The Company ended the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 with 367 directly operated stores, comprised of 106 Ralph Lauren stores, 58 Club Monaco stores, 191 Polo factory stores and 12 Rugby stores. The Company also operated 510 concession shop locations

worldwide at the end of the fourth quarter. In addition to Company-operated locations, global licensing partners operated 57 Ralph Lauren stores and 48 dedicated concession shops as well as 56 Club Monaco stores at the end of the fourth quarter.
Fiscal 2012 Outlook
In the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, the Company expects consolidated revenues to increase in the mid 20% range. Wholesale revenues are expected to grow at a low 20% rate in the first quarter and retail revenues are expected to grow slightly faster, including comparable store sales that are projected to increase by a low double-digit rate. The Company expects the operating margin from continuing operations for the first quarter of Fiscal 2012 to be approximately equivalent to that in the comparable prior year period.
The Company currently expects consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2012 to increase by a mid teens percentage, with retail revenues growing slightly faster than wholesale revenues. Based on the anticipated impact of cost of goods inflation and increased investment in strategic growth initiatives, in addition to business disruption in Japan, the Company expects the operating margin from continuing operations for Fiscal 2012 to be 100-150 basis points below the prior year. The full year Fiscal 2012 tax rate is estimated at 33%. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $325 million in Fiscal 2012.

Polo Ralph Lauren is a global company that reports its financial information in U.S. dollars, in accordance with U.S. GAAP (GAAP). Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars because the underlying currencies in which the Company transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results. As a supplement to its reported operating results, the Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in its businesses. These constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company's operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
