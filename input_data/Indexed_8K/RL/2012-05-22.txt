Ralph Lauren Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2012 Results
 
 
New York (May 22, 2012)  Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) today reported net income of $94 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, compared to net income of $73 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.  Net income for Fiscal 2012 was $681 million, or $7.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $568 million, or $5.75 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2011.
 
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a 100% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock.  The new quarterly cash dividend is now $0.40 per share.  Over the next year, the new annual dividend amount will be $1.60 per share and result in an anticipated annualized payout of approximately $150 million. The next quarterly dividend is payable on July 13, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 29, 2012.
 
Fiscal 2012 was another year of spectacular growth for our Company, said Ralph Lauren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  We made significant progress with our international expansion efforts and we launched exciting new products during the year. I am thrilled with the momentum we are gaining with our handbags worldwide and we will continue to invest in innovation and distribution to support this high growth merchandise category. We are in the midst of transforming our presence in Greater China, a region that we believe will become an important driver of growth for us over the long term, and have some magnificent new stores planned for the next several years. As proud as I am of what weve accomplished, I am even more excited about the many compelling opportunities that are still ahead for us, Mr. Lauren added.
 
 Sales and profit growth exceeded 20% in Fiscal 2012, which is an acceleration of a multi-year trend of double-digit gains even as weve consistently reinvested in the business, said Roger Farah, President and Chief Operating Officer.  Our Fiscal 2012 performance is particularly noteworthy considering the unprecedented raw materials cost inflation and highly uncertain market conditions that persisted throughout the year. Much of our progress in Fiscal 2012 was achieved with market share and productivity gains in existing locations.  As we look to the future, we believe we have significant potential to expand our distribution, particularly in international markets.  And while we enter Fiscal 2013 excited about our global growth initiatives, we are cautious about near-term economic trends, particularly in Europe, and have planned the year accordingly. Whatever the near-term challenges may be, they do not alter our
 
 
 
 
 
 
long-term growth expectations and our commitment to investing to support those goals. The doubling of our dividend is a clear indication of our Boards recognition of our strong performance, liquidity metrics and long term plans, in addition to our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2012 Income Statement Review
 
Net revenues for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $1.6 billion from $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011. The higher net revenues reflect double-digit sales growth at the Companys retail and wholesale segments, including low double-digit comparable store sales growth.
Net Revenues.
 
 
Net revenues for the full year Fiscal 2012 period increased 21% to $6.9 billion.  The growth in net revenues reflects strong retail and wholesale segment expansion, including mid-teens comparable store sales growth and favorable foreign currency effects.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 increased 14% to $926 million from $810 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.  Gross profit rate was 57.1%, 30 basis points above the prior year level. The improvement in gross profit rate primarily reflects the favorable impact of channel and product mix that was partially offset by the net impact of higher cost of goods.
Gross Profit.  
 
Gross profit for Fiscal 2012 increased 20% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.3 billion in Fiscal 2011.  Gross profit rate for Fiscal 2012 was 58.3%, 30 basis points below the prior year.  The decline in gross profit rate was primarily due to the negative net impact of cost of goods inflation that was partially offset by favorable channel and geographic mix compared to the prior year.
 
Operating expenses increased 14% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 to $790 million from $693 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.  Operating expense margin was 48.7%, ten basis points greater than the prior year period.  The higher operating expense margin primarily reflects overall business expansion, including strong retail segment growth, in addition to incremental costs associated with the transition of certain formerly licensed operations and continued investment in the Company's strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure.  Restructuring charges of $10 million also contributed to the growth in operating expenses.
Operating Expenses.  
 
Operating expenses for Fiscal 2012 were $3.0 billion, 20% greater than Fiscal 2011. Operating expense margin was 43.1%, 60 basis points below Fiscal 2011, as leverage on strong sales growth more than offset incremental costs associated with the transition of certain formerly licensed operations, higher retail segment penetration and continued investment in the Company's strategic growth initiatives and infrastructure.
 
  Operating income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 was $136 million, 16% greater than the prior year period.  Operating income margin was 8.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011. The improvement in operating income and margin rate is primarily attributable to the stronger gross profit margin discussed above and was achieved despite higher expenses associated with newly transitioned operations, business expansion and restructuring charges.

Fiscal 2012s operating income of $1.0 billion was 23% greater than Fiscal 2011 and the operating margin increased 30 basis points to 15.2%.  The growth in operating income and higher operating margin reflect double-digit sales growth and leverage on operating expenses that more than offset the gross margin compression discussed above.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fiscal 2012 licensing operating income increased 4% to $112 million from $108 million in Fiscal 2011.  The improvement in licensing operating income primarily reflects lower net costs associated with the transition of formerly licensed operations to directly controlled operations and higher licensing revenues.
 
  Net income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 was $94 million, a 29% increase from $73 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, and net income per diluted share rose 34% to $0.99 from $0.74 in the prior year period.  The growth in net income and net income per diluted share is principally related to the higher operating income discussed above, in
Net Income and Diluted EPS.

addition to a lower effective tax rate. The Company had an effective tax rate of 28% compared to 34% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, primarily due to the favorable effect of discrete tax items in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
 
Net income for Fiscal 2012 increased 20% to $681 million from $568 million in Fiscal 2011.  Net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2012 was $7.13, 24% greater than the $5.75 earned in Fiscal 2011.  The growth in net income and net income per diluted share is principally due to the higher operating income discussed above, which was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate of 33% compared to 31% in Fiscal 2011.  The higher effective tax rate in Fiscal 2012 primarily reflects the favorable effect of discrete tax items in the prior year as well as a greater portion of earnings generated in higher taxed jurisdictions in Fiscal 2012.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2012 Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Review
 
The Company ended Fiscal 2012 with $1.3 billion in cash and investments compared to $1.1 billion in cash and investments at the end of Fiscal 2011.  Cash and investments net of debt (net cash) was $1.0 billion at the end of Fiscal 2012 compared to $839 million of net cash at the end of Fiscal 2011.  The fourth quarter ended with inventory up 20% to $842 million from $702 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011. The higher inventory is primarily attributable to an investment to support anticipated sales growth, including incremental inventory to support new stores and concession shops; new operations and new merchandise categories, such as home textiles, international e-commerce and Denim & Supply; and the inflationary impact on cost of goods.
 
The Company had $272 million in capital expenditures in Fiscal 2012, compared to $255 million in the prior year period. During Fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock, utilizing approximately $395 million of its authorized share repurchase programs.  The Company has approximately $577 million remaining under its authorized share repurchase programs.
 
Global Retail Store Network
 
The Company ended the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 with 379 directly operated stores, comprised of 103 Ralph Lauren stores, 59 Club Monaco stores, 201 Polo factory stores and 16 Rugby stores. The Company also operated 474 concession shop locations worldwide at the end of the fourth quarter. In addition to Company-operated locations, global licensing partners operated 59 Ralph Lauren stores and 27 dedicated concession shops as well as 58 Club Monaco stores at the end of the fourth quarter.

Fiscal 2013 Outlook
 
The Company currently expects consolidated net revenues for Fiscal 2013 to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage, reflecting the net impact of a low single-digit decline in wholesale sales and a low double-digit increase in retail sales. Strategic decisions regarding certain operations, including reduced distribution in Greater China and for American Living, combined with unfavorable foreign currency effects, are estimated to mitigate consolidated net revenue growth by approximately 400-500 basis points for the full year period. Operating margin from continuing operations for Fiscal 2013 is currently expected to be modestly above the prior year period as anticipated gross profit margin expansion is largely offset by continued investment in the Companys long-term growth initiatives and the impact of overall channel mix.  The full year Fiscal 2013 tax rate is estimated at 33%. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $360 million in Fiscal 2013.
In the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, the Company expects consolidated net revenues to increase by a low single-digit percentage. Wholesale sales are expected to be flat to slightly below the prior year period, as strength in North America is offset by a decline in Europe, the continued transition of certain Japanese wholesale operations to directly operated concessions and the closure of certain wholesale operations in Greater China. Retail sales are expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage, reflecting broad-based momentum worldwide.  Foreign currency effects are estimated to negatively impact net revenue growth by approximately 200-300 basis points in the first quarter.  Operating margin from continuing operations for the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 is expected to be approximately 250-300 basis points below the comparable prior year period due to the timing of investments to support the Companys strategic growth objectives and the impact of overall channel mix.

Ralph Lauren is a global company that reports its financial information in U.S. dollars, in accordance with U.S. GAAP (GAAP). Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars because the underlying currencies in which the Company transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results. As a supplement to its reported operating results, the Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in its businesses. These constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company's operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
