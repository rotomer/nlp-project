(NYSE: ROK) Chairman and CEO Don H. Davis, in a presentation at the Deutsche Bank Basic Industries Conference today, stated that diluted EPS in the fiscal second quarter is expected to be in the range of 24 to 25 cents.

The proceeds from the transaction total $10 million and approximate the company's net book value of tangible assets related to REJ. The non-cash charge that will be recognized in the fiscal second quarter relates to intangible assets associated with REJ. In fiscal 2002, REJ sales were approximately $40 million and Rockwell Automation's share of REJ's losses was approximately $1 million.
