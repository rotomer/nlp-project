Last year's second quarter net income of $61 million (33 cents per share) included a tax benefit of $18 million (10 cents per share).

2nd Quarter Earnings Rockwell Automation Page 2 Davis added, "We remain focused on executing our strategy in order to deliver on our commitment of profitable growth. We are continuing to invest in key growth areas such as our Logix(TM), Process Solutions and Global Manufacturing Solutions businesses. At the same time we remain diligent in maintaining a lean cost structure." Davis concluded, "The timing and pace of improvement in the global economy remain difficult to predict. Our markets have remained generally stable for the past two quarters and we anticipate that this trend will continue for the balance of our fiscal year. Accordingly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.10." Following is a discussion of results for each Rockwell Automation business for the second quarter. Control Systems - --------------- Control Systems second quarter sales were $830 million, an increase of 11 percent compared to sales of $749 million in the second quarter of 2002. Approximately 4 percent of the sales growth was due to the favorable impact of currency translation. From a regional perspective, sales outside of the U.S. increased 22 percent (12 percent excluding currency translation) and U.S. sales were up 4 percent. (more)

Power Systems - ------------- Power Systems second quarter sales were $175 million compared to $176 million in the second quarter of 2002.

General Corporate - Net - ----------------------- Second quarter 2003 general corporate expenses were $14 million compared to $16 million in the second quarter of 2002, driven primarily by lower corporate staff costs.

Last year's second quarter tax rate includes a tax benefit of $18 million from the resolution of certain tax matters.
