(NYSE: ROK), a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions, today reported fiscal 2003 third quarter net income of $128 million (67 cents per share). This result includes a tax benefit of $69 million (36 cents per share) related to the settlement of a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim. Last year's third quarter net income was $90 million (47 cents per share) and included the following items: o A tax benefit of $30 million (16 cents per share) from the resolution of certain tax matters for the period 1995-1999; o A tax benefit of $4 million (2 cents per share) from the reduction in the fiscal 2002 effective tax rate from 27 percent to 24 percent; and o Income of $5 million ($4 million after-tax, or 2 cents per share) from the favorable settlement of intellectual property matters. Sales for the third quarter were $1,033 million compared to $995 million in the third quarter of 2002. (more)
3rd Quarter Earnings Rockwell Automation Page 2 Don H. Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We continue to be pleased with the performance of our businesses in this soft economic environment. The management team delivered excellent results, especially in light of industrial market conditions that were slightly weaker than in the previous quarter." Davis added, "We are executing our strategy of balancing cost structure improvements with growth investments to improve profitability and maintain our market leadership position. Our program of Lean initiatives contributes to our improved margins while generating savings for continued investments. Continued growth in our Logix(TM) and Process Solutions businesses has resulted in market share gains." Davis concluded, "The timing and pace of improvement in the global economy remain difficult to predict. During the past quarter, we saw some softening in demand in the U.S. and Europe, but on balance there is no discernable trend of further weakness. We are assuming that our business will remain at the current run rate for the remainder of the fiscal year. Accordingly, we continue to expect full year diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.10 excluding the third quarter tax benefit." Following is a discussion of third quarter results for each business segment. (more)
3rd Quarter Earnings Rockwell Automation Page 3 Control Systems - --------------- Control Systems third quarter sales were $824 million, an increase of 5 percent compared to sales of $788 million in the third quarter of 2002. The entire sales increase is attributable to the effect of currency translation. Sales outside the U.S. increased 20 percent (7 percent excluding currency translation) while U.S. sales were down about 5 percent. The Logix(TM) and Process Solutions businesses each increased approximately 20 percent from last year's third quarter. Segment operating earnings were $103 million compared to $91 million in 2002's third quarter. This increase in profitability is due to the benefits of continued cost reduction efforts. Control Systems' return on sales was 12.5 percent compared to 11.5 percent in 2002's third quarter. Power Systems - ------------- Power Systems third quarter sales were $180 million compared to $178 million in the third quarter of 2002. Segment operating earnings were $15 million in 2003 and 2002. Power Systems return on sales was 8.3 percent compared to 8.4 percent in last year's third quarter. Rockwell FirstPoint Contact - --------------------------- Rockwell FirstPoint Contact sales in the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 were $29 million. Operating earnings were breakeven for the quarter, compared to $1 million in the third quarter of 2002. (more)
3rd Quarter Earnings Rockwell Automation Page 4 Other Items - ----------- Third quarter 2003 general corporate expenses were $17 million, including $2 million related to the bankruptcy of a subtenant in a leased facility. This result compares to $9 million in the third quarter of 2002, which includes income of $5 million related to the settlement of intellectual property matters. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2003 was $11 million compared to $17 million in the third quarter of 2002. The decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the company's $150 million principal amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, lower short-term borrowings and the benefit of an interest rate swap. Income taxes for the quarter include a benefit of $69 million related to the settlement of a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim. The full year effective tax rate is estimated to be 30 percent, excluding the effect of the research and experimentation settlement and the second quarter Reliance Electric Limited Japan transaction. Cash Flow - --------- On June 13, 2003, the company made a voluntary contribution of $50 million to its primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust. Including the effect of this contribution, free cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2003 was $207 million, compared to $224 million in the first (more)
