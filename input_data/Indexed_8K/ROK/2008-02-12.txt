On February 6, 2008, our shareowners approved the Rockwell Automation, Inc. 2008 Long-Term Incentives Plan (the "2008 Plan"), which was adopted by our Board of Directors on December 5, 2007, subject to approval by our shareowners. The 2008 Plan is described in our proxy statement dated December 14, 2007 for the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. The 2008 Plan replaces the Rockwell Automation, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan (the "2000 Plan") and, as of the date of shareowner approval of the 2008 Plan, no further grants will be made under the 2000 Plan. Outstanding awards under the 2000 Plan will continue in accordance with the terms and conditions of the awards and the 2000 Plan. The 2008 Plan permits the grant of a variety of awards to employees (including our named executive officers) and prospective employees, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares. The number of shares that may be delivere d under the 2008 Plan may not exceed 4.1 million plus any shares remaining available for delivery under the 2000 Plan as of the date of shareowner approval of the 2008 Plan.
