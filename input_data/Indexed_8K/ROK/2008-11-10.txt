Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under SFAS 123(R), which requires us to report the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. Cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects. U.S. federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal business of our former Power Systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds. These taxes paid in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
 
Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates or acquisitions made during the period. Management uses organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2008 compared to sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2007:

Income from Continuing Operations Excluding Special Charges
Our press release contains financial information and earnings guidance regarding income from continuing operations excluding special charges, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this provides useful information to investors because it reflects the operating performance of the continuing business excluding special charges. Management uses income from continuing operations excluding special charges as a measure of company performance.
Income from Continuing Operations Excluding Special Charges is calculated as follows:
 
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)
We define EBITDA as income from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Below are the components of EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA to income from continuing operations. Interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization are incorporated into the EBITDA calculation as they each are reported in the GAAP financial statements. Management believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors about our operating performance. EBITDA is not a substitute for net income as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles nor is it a complete measure of an entity's profitability because it does not include costs and expenses for depreciation, amortization, interest and income taxes. Our definition of EBITDA may be different from definitions used by other companies.
EBITDA is calculated as follows:
 
 
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in its operations. Management uses ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate the performance of the company. Our measure of ROIC is likely to differ from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations and income from Power Systems discontinued operating activities, before non-operating gains or losses, special charges, interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, cumulative impairments of goodwill and intangibles required under SFAS No. 142, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
