Nosbusch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Automation, Inc., entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to 301,097 shares issuable upon exercise of stock options awarded to Mr. Nosbusch on October 2, 2000. The options have an exercise price of $11.6038 per share and expire on October 2, 2010. The trading plan becomes effective on May 1, 2009. Under the plan, the options will be exercised and the underlying shares will be sold on the open market if minimum price thresholds are met during specified trading periods after public announcem ent of quarter end earnings. Mr. Nosbusch entered into the plan as part of his tax and financial planning strategy to diversify and liquidate long-term assets before the options expire.
