Rockwell Automation Reports First Quarter 2010 Results
MILWAUKEE (January 27, 2010)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2010 first quarter revenue of $1,067.5 million, down 10 percent compared to $1,189.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. An organic sales decline of 15.5 percent was partially offset by growth of approximately 4 percentage points from currency translation and 1 percentage point from acquisitions. Fiscal 2010 first quarter revenue was down 1 percent sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 first quarter income from continuing operations was $77.8 million or $0.54 per share, compared to $115.6 million or $0.81 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 first quarter net income was $76.6 million or $0.53 per share, compared to $118.4 million or $0.83 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
 
Segment operating earnings were $136.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, down from $177.6 million in the same period of 2009. Earnings decreased primarily due to the revenue decline, partially offset by cost reductions. Segment operating margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was 12.8 percent compared to 14.9 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Segment operating margin was up 5.4 points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, or up 2.3 points sequentially excluding fourth quarter fiscal 2009 restructuring charges.
First quarter of fiscal 2010 free cash flow from continuing operations was $108.0 million. Return on invested capital was 9.5 percent.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am pleased by our solid performance in the first quarter. Product revenues in the quarter exceeded our expectations, and the resulting favorable revenue mix contributed to sequential margin improvement in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenue declined in the quarter, but the rate of decline has moderated considerably, and we saw strong growth in emerging Asia. We also delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow."
 
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "Our first quarter performance and continued improvement in the global economy seem to indicate that we are at the early stage of a recovery. However, high unemployment, historically low levels of capacity utilization and a very cautious capital spending outlook create uncertainty as to the shape of the recovery in manufacturing. Given our improved revenue baseline, we are revising our full year fiscal 2010 earnings per share guidance to $2.00 to $2.40 on a revenue range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion.
Outlook
"We will continue to effectively manage our cost structure while appropriately investing in key technologies and growth opportunities. We are well positioned to take advantage of the recovery and we are ready to serve our customers' needs when their automation spend increases."

Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S.GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three months ended December 31, 2009 compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2008:

Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC is likely to differ from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before special items, interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
 
Total Segment Operating Earnings and Margin Excluding Restructuring Charges
Total segment operating earnings and margin excluding restructuring charges are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect the operating performance of the continuing business excluding restructuring charges. Management uses total segment operating earnings and margin excluding restructuring charges as measures of company performance and profitability.
Total Segment Operating Earnings and Margin Excluding Restructuring Charges are calculated as follows:
