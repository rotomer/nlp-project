Rockwell Automation Reports Second Quarter 2010 Results
MILWAUKEE (April 28, 2010)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2010 second quarter revenue of $1,164.5 million, up 10 percent compared to $1,058.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Currency translation contributed 5 percentage points to the increase. Fiscal 2010 second quarter revenue was up 9 percent sequentially compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 second quarter income from continuing operations was $111.9 million ($0.77 per share), compared to $40.6 million ($0.29 per share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 second quarter net income was $137.0 million ($0.95 per share), including $25.1 million (or $0.18 per share) from discontinued operations primarily due to the favorable resolution of a tax matter related to the fiscal 2007 Power Systems divestiture.
 
Total segment operating earnings were $177.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, up from $86.2 million in the same period of 2009. Total segment operating margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 increased to 15.2 percent from 8.1 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, primarily due to higher segment operating margin in the Architecture & Software segment. Total segment operating margin was up 2.4 points sequentially compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
Free cash flow was $166.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Return on invested capital was 13.2 percent.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our strong performance in the quarter reflects continued improvement in market conditions. We saw a return to year-over-year organic growth in the quarter, with continued momentum in our product revenues, meaningful growth in North America and mid-teens growth in emerging Asia. Increased volume, favorable mix and the impact of our previous cost reduction actions all contributed to significant year-over-year margin improvement in the quarter. And we continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Given the market uncertainties at the beginning of this fiscal year, I am very pleased with our year-to-date results."
 
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "Given our second quarter performance and the ongoing global economic recovery, we are confident that we will return to solid organic growth for full fiscal year 2010. In the second half of the year we will increase our spending on customer-facing resources in our highest growth markets and innovation in our product, services and solutions offerings. Based on this outlook, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2010 guidance to earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.90 on a revenue range of $4.65 billion to $4.8 billion."
Outlook
Nosbusch continued, "The recovery is underway. While the shape of the recovery remains uncertain, we are well positioned to outperform the underlying market in this cycle. Our growth prospects are bright. I am excited by the new opportunities we see every day, particularly in the areas of process control, OEMs, and emerging markets. Our focus on customer success has provided superior long-term returns for our shareowners in the past and I believe it will do so in the future."

Control Products & Solutions fiscal 2010 second quarter sales were $648.3 million, a decrease of 2 percent from $664.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

Segment operating earnings were $54.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, up slightly from $53.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 despite lower revenue, primarily due to favorable mix.

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and six months ended March 31, 2010 compared to sales for the three and six months ended March 31, 2009:
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for our operating segments for the three and six months ended March 31, 2010 compared to sales for the three and six months ended March 31, 2009:
 
Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before special items, interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
