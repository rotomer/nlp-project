Rockwell Automation Reports Third Quarter 2010 Results
MILWAUKEE (July 28, 2010)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2010 third quarter revenue of $1,268.1 million, up 25 percent compared to $1,010.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The year-over-year impact from currency translation was negligible in the quarter. Fiscal 2010 third quarter revenue was up 9 percent sequentially compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 third quarter net income was $119.4 million ($0.83 per share), compared to $32.8 million ($0.23 per share) in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
 
Total segment operating earnings were $198.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, up from $86.3 million in the same period of 2009. Total segment operating margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 increased to 15.6 percent from 8.5 percent a year ago, primarily due to higher segment operating margin in the Architecture & Software segment.
Free cash flow was $116.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Return on invested capital was 17.7 percent.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am pleased with the strong revenue and earnings performance this quarter. Our revenue growth was broad-based across all regions. China had an exceptional quarter with 42 percent year-over-year organic growth and Latin America rebounded strongly. Operating margin expanded and we increased spending to fuel future growth."
 
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow sequentially on the strength of our solutions and services business and emerging markets. Based on our third quarter results and this outlook, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2010 guidance to earnings per share of $2.95 to $3.05 on revenue of approximately $4.8 billion."
Outlook
Nosbusch continued, "We have performed very well in the early part of the recovery. Although macroeconomic conditions are uncertain, we are optimistic that the global recovery will continue. I am confident in our strategy and our ability to execute. We are well-positioned to take advantage of improving market conditions as we proceed through the cycle."
Following is a discussion of third quarter results for both segments.
Architecture & Software fiscal 2010 third quarter sales were $553.9 million, an increase of 39 percent from $399.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2010 compared to sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2009:
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for our operating segments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2010 compared to sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2009:
 
Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before special items, interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
