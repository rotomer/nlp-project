News Release
Rockwell Automation Reports Fourth Quarter 2010 Results
MILWAUKEE (November 9, 2010)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2010 fourth quarter revenue of $1,356.9 million, up 26 percent compared to $1,074.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Currency translation negatively impacted revenue growth by 1 percentage point. Fiscal 2010 fourth quarter net income was $131.3 million or $0.91 per share, compared to $28.9 million or $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Total segment operating earnings were $205.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, up from $79.6 million in the same period of 2009. Total segment operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 increased to 15.1 percent from 7.4 percent a year ago, primarily due to higher segment operating margin in the Architecture & Software segment.
 
Free cash flow was $19.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 after a discretionary pre-tax contribution of $150 million to the company's U.S. pension trust.
Sales for the full fiscal year were $4,857.0 million, up 12 percent compared to $4,332.5 million in fiscal 2009. Foreign currency translation contributed 2 percentage points to the increase. Income from continuing operations was $440.4 million or $3.05 per share, compared to $217.9 million or $1.53 per share in fiscal 2009. Segment operating earnings were $717.2 million, up 67 percent compared to $429.7 million in fiscal 2009. Full fiscal year 2010 free cash flow from continuing operations was $410.7 million, after the previously-mentioned pension contribution in the fourth quarter. Return on invested capital was 22.8 percent.
Full Fiscal Year 2010
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
 
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We capped the year with another quarter of strong revenue growth in all regions. I was particularly pleased to see very strong year-over-year growth again this quarter in China and India and strong sequential growth in Latin America and Europe. Logix grew 36 percent in the quarter.
"Our results confirm that our growth and performance strategy is working. For the full year, we grew revenue 12 percent and doubled earnings per share compared to fiscal 2009. Operating margin improved by 5 points, a great result in light of the compensation cost headwinds and growth investments we made in the second half of the year. Strong cash flow during the year enabled us to resume share repurchases, increase the dividend by 21 percent and make a $150 million discretionary U.S. pension contribution. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet.
"Our performance this year is evidence that we are executing well as the recovery progresses and I want to thank our employees, customers and partners for their support throughout the year."
 
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "We believe that the global economic recovery will continue in fiscal 2011. We are starting to see signs that large capital project spending will improve, but timing remains somewhat uncertain. The growth investments we made in 2010 improve our ability to outperform the market in 2011 and beyond. For fiscal 2011 we are projecting revenue growth of 8 to12 percent excluding currency, plus 1 percent growth from currency translation. Based on this revenue outlook, we are providing fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance of $3.80 to $4.20."
Outlook
Nosbusch continued, "Increased exposure to mid- and late-cycle markets should help as the recovery continues. Our strong balance sheet positions us to fund organic growth, make catalytic acquisitions and return capital to shareowners. Our strategy is to capitalize on expanded growth opportunities and technology differentiation. We remain committed to innovation, deepening our domain expertise and thought leadership  all key ingredients for helping our customers achieve their productivity and sustainability goals."

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2010 compared to sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2009:
The following table reconciles reported sales to organic sales for our operating segments for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2010 compared to sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2009:
 
Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before special items, interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
