News Release
Rockwell Automation Reports First Quarter 2011 Results
MILWAUKEE (January 26, 2011)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2011 first quarter revenue of $1,365.8 million, up 28 percent compared to $1,067.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The year-over-year impact of currency translation was negligible in the quarter. Fiscal 2011 first quarter net income was $150.1 million or $1.04 per share, compared to $76.6 million or $0.53 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
Total segment operating earnings were $222.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, up from $136.8 million in the same period of 2010. Total segment operating margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 increased to 16.3 percent from 12.8 percent a year ago, primarily due to volume leverage.
 
Free cash flow was $4.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, low relative to net income, primarily due to payouts of performance-based compensation earned in fiscal 2010. Return on invested capital was 25.7 percent.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We saw strong sales growth in the quarter across all regions, led by emerging markets. Operating margin continued to expand and this was the fifth consecutive quarter of operating earnings improvement. Return on invested capital of 25.7 percent is now well above our long-term goal of 20 percent and is approaching the 26 percent peak that we saw in the last cycle. Our results in the first quarter reflect solid underlying market conditions and great execution of our growth and performance strategy. I am extremely pleased with the excellent start to the fiscal year."
 
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "Our strong revenue performance in the first quarter, along with positive macroeconomic trends and forecasts, indicates that the global industrial recovery is continuing. We now project revenues for fiscal 2011 to range from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. Based on this revenue outlook, we are revising our fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance to $4.30 to $4.60. A result in this range would represent record earnings per share for the company."

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2009:

Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S.GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before special items, interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
