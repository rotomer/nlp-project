Rockwell Automation Reports Second Quarter 2011 Results
MILWAUKEE (April 27, 2011)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2011 second quarter revenue of $1,464.1 million, up 26 percent from $1,164.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Currency translation contributed 2 percentage points to the increase. Fiscal 2011 second quarter net income and income from continuing operations were $166.4 million or $1.14 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $111.9 million or $0.77 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Last year, second quarter net income was $137.0 million or $0.95 per share, including $25.1 million or $0.18 per share from discontinued operations.
 
Total segment operating earnings were $244.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, up from $177.3 million in the same period of 2010. Total segment operating margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 increased to 16.7 percent from 15.2 percent a year ago.
Free cash flow was $226.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Return on invested capital was 27.5 percent.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "The strong results we saw in the first quarter continued in the second quarter. Sales growth was broad-based, operating margin continued to expand, and we generated strong free cash flow. Both earnings per share from continuing operations and return on invested capital were record highs for the company. I am pleased with our ability to capitalize on solid underlying market conditions as we execute our growth and performance strategy."
 
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "Our strong revenue performance in the first half, continued strength in the industrial sector and an increased tailwind from currency are positives as we enter the third quarter. However, events such as the earthquake in Japan and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa have added uncertainty to the global macroeconomic environment. Taking all of these factors into account, we are increasing our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year to $5.7 to $5.8 billion. Based on this revenue outlook, and additional headwinds from material cost inflation and higher oil prices, we are narrowing fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance to $4.40 to $4.60. A result in this range would represent almost a 50 percent increase in earnings per share from fiscal 2010 and record earnings per share for the company."
Following is a discussion of second quarter results for both segments.

Architecture & Software fiscal 2011 second quarter sales were $624.2 million, an increase of 21 percent from $516.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and six months ended March 31, 2011 compared to sales for the three and six months ended March 31, 2010:

Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
