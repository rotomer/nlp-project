Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
During the period from October 6, 2011 through October 11, 2011, Rockwell Automation, Inc. (the "Company") issued unsecured commercial paper obligations in an aggregate principal amount of $275 million with various maturities between 1 and 52 days. The weighted average interest rate of this issuance was 0.21% per annum. The commercial paper was offered and sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As these obligations mature, the Company anticipates that it will issue additional short-term, unsecured commercial paper obligations in the ordinary course of business to refinance all or part of the commercial paper borrowings detailed above. Proceeds of the commercial paper were used to partially fund a $300 million voluntary contribution to the Companys U.S. qualified pension plan trust, which was made on October 11, 2011.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
In addition to the October 11, 2011 contribution described under Item 2.03 above, the Company made a $150 million voluntary contribution to its U.S. qualified pension plan trust in September 2011, which was funded with cash on hand.
