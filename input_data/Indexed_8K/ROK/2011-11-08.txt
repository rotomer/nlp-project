News Release
Rockwell Automation Reports Fourth Quarter 2011 Results
MILWAUKEE (November 8, 2011)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2011 fourth quarter sales of $1,654.3 million, up 22 percent from $1,356.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Currency translation contributed 4 percentage points to the increase, while acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point. Fiscal 2011 fourth quarter sales were up 9 percent sequentially compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Net income was $201.8 million ($1.39 per share) compared to $131.3 million ($0.91 per share) a year ago, an increase of 53 percent on a per-share basis.
Total segment operating earnings were $298.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, up from $205.1 million in the same period of 2010. Total segment operating margin increased to 18.0 percent from 15.1 percent a year ago primarily due to volume leverage, partially offset by mix and spending to support growth.
 
Free cash flow was $137.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 after a discretionary pre-tax contribution of $150 million to the company's U.S. pension trust.
Full year results set record highs for sales, earnings per share from continuing operations and return on invested capital. Sales were $6,000.4 million, up 24 percent compared to $4,857.0 million in fiscal 2010. Currency translation and acquisitions contributed 4 percentage points to the increase. Income from continuing operations was $697.1 million or $4.79 per share, compared to $440.4 million or $3.05 per share in fiscal 2010, an increase of 57 percent on a per-share basis. Segment operating earnings were $1,027.6 million, compared to $717.2 million in 2010. Full fiscal year 2011 free cash flow was $561.7 million, after the previously-mentioned pension contribution in the fourth quarter. Return on invested capital was 31.6 percent.
Full Fiscal Year 2011
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "The fourth quarter capped a year of outstanding sales and earnings performance. Sales growth was strong in all regions. Control Products & Solutions had a great quarter with 18 percent organic growth. Total segment operating margin expanded to 18 percent and it was another record quarter for sales and earnings per share.
 
"For the full year, sales grew 24 percent and earnings per share grew 57 percent. Key growth accelerators hit on all cylinders. Logix sales increased 29 percent, reflecting the success of our plant-wide optimization strategy and continued growth both in process applications and with OEM customers. Emerging markets grew over 30 percent and now represent 22 percent of total sales. We invested in our best growth opportunities while improving operating margin by over 2 points. Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to fund organic growth, make two acquisitions, significantly increase our dividend for a second straight year, repurchase 4 million shares and contribute $450 million to our U.S. pension trust in September and October.
"These outstanding results give me confidence in both our strategy and our execution. I want to thank our employees for their dedication and our customers and partners for their support throughout the year."
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "Despite an uncertain global economic picture and moderating growth rates, we are cautiously optimistic that market growth will continue in 2012. We enter the year with a sound strategy, a track record of success in our growth initiatives and a robust new product pipeline. For fiscal 2012 we are providing a sales outlook of $6.2 to $6.5 billion, which represents sales growth of 5 to 9 percent excluding currency. Based on this sales outlook, we are initiating fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5.05 to $5.45."
 
Nosbusch continued, "In the coming year we will remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. Our strategic priorities are unchanged and we will continue to invest to pursue our best growth opportunities."

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2011 compared to sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2010:
The following table reconciles reported sales to organic sales for our operating segments for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2011 compared to sales for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2010:
 
Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
