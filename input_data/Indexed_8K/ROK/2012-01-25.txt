Rockwell Automation Reports First Quarter 2012 Results and Reaffirms Guidance
 
 
 
MILWAUKEE (January 25, 2012)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2012 first quarter sales of $1,473.9 million, up 8 percent from $1,365.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point to the increase and currency translation reduced sales by 1 percentage point. Net income was $183.3 million ($1.27 per share) compared to $150.1 million ($1.04 per share) last year, an increase of 22 percent on a per-share basis.
Total segment operating earnings were $283.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, up from $222.0 million in the same period of 2011. Total segment operating margin increased to 19.3 percent from 16.3 percent a year ago primarily due to volume leverage.
Free cash flow was a use of cash of $210.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 after a discretionary pre-tax contribution of $300 million to the company's U.S. pension trust and payouts of performance-based compensation earned in fiscal 2011. Return on invested capital was 31.5 percent.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We had great earnings growth on good sales growth in the quarter. Segment margins expanded and EPS growth of 22 percent was very strong. Regional sales growth rates varied, particularly in the solutions businesses. Process had a great quarter with 22 percent sales growth. In this macroeconomic environment, I am pleased with the solid start to the fiscal year."
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, "With one quarter behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic and market conditions, we are not changing our sales outlook for the year. Based on fiscal 2012 projected sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5.05 to $5.45. Although we may see uneven results throughout the year, sales and earnings in our guidance range would represent another record year for the company."
 
 
Following is a discussion of first quarter results for both segments.

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period's sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2010:

Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
 
 
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, for the most recent twelve months, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners' equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the twelve-month period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
