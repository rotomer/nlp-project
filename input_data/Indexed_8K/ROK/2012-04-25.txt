Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, Sales growth was solid in the second quarter and segment operating earnings grew 10 percent. We had strong cash flow in the quarter and Process continued to perform well with 23 percent sales growth. I am pleased with our performance in the first half of the year. On healthy 7 percent sales growth, segment operating margin expanded 1.7 points and EPS grew 12 percent.
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, With two quarters behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic and market conditions, we are maintaining the mid-point of our sales outlook for the year but narrowing the range by $100 million. Based on fiscal 2012 projected sales of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion, we are maintaining the mid-point of fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance and narrowing the range to $5.10 to $5.40. Sales and earnings in our guidance range would represent another record year for the company.

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the
three and six
months ended
March 31, 2012
compared to sales for the
three and six
months ended

Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
 
 
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, for the most recent twelve months, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the twelve-month period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
