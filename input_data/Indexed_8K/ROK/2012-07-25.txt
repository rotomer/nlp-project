Rockwell Automation Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
 
MILWAUKEE (
July 25, 2012
)  Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal
2012

quarter sales of
$1,560.4 million
, up
3 percent
from
$1,516.2 million

Free cash flow was
$232.2 million
in the
third
quarter of fiscal
2012
. Return on invested capital was
30.4 percent
.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.
Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, We delivered solid 7 percent organic sales growth in the quarter with organic growth in all regions. Operating margin expanded almost a point and earnings per share grew 9 percent. It was a good quarter in the midst of a challenging macroeconomic environment.
Outlook
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch added, Most economic indicators have weakened from a quarter ago and the global political environment remains unsettled. Based on this increased uncertainty and our sales performance in the third quarter, we now expect slower growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in Latin America and emerging Asia. Taking these factors into consideration, plus an increasing headwind from currency, we are reducing our sales outlook for the fiscal year to approximately $6.2 billion. Correspondingly, we are revising our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance range to $5.00 to $5.20, with about five cents of the reduction coming from currency. Sales and earnings in this range would represent another record year for the company.
We are monitoring business conditions closely and will continue to balance near-term financial performance with longer-term growth opportunities. The additional share repurchase authorization and 11 percent dividend increase announced in June support our commitment to provide superior returns to shareowners."

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.
The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the
three and nine
months ended
June 30, 2012
compared to sales for the
three and nine
months ended

Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
 
 
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, for the most recent twelve months, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the twelve-month period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:
