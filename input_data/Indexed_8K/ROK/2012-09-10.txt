(A) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under this section) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
(B) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under this section) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
 
(C) To the extent that a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (A) and (B), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such person in connection therewith. If any such person is not wholly successful in any such action, suit or proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters therein, the Corporation shall indemnify such person against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such person in connection with each claim, issue or matter that is successfully resolved. For purposes of this subsection and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.
(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to the extent any person is a witness in, but not a party to, any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under this section) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation such person shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such person in connection therewith.
(E) Indemnification under subsections (A) and (B) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, trustee, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (A) and (B). Such determination shall be made (1) if a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall not have occurred, (a) with respect to a person who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum or (ii) if there are no Disinterested Directors or, even if there are Disinterested Directors, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs, by (x) Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (y) the shareowners of the Corporation; or (b) with respect to a person who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, by the chief executive officer of the Corporation or by such other officer of the Corporation as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors; or (2) if a Change of Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel selected by the claimant in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, unless the claimant shall request that such determination be made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (in the case of a claimant who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) or by an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination (in the case of a claimant who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation), in which case it shall be made in accordance with clause (1) of this sentence. Any claimant shall be entitled to be indemnified against the expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such claimant in cooperating with the person or entity making the determination of entitlement to indemnification (irrespective of the determination as to the claimant's entitlement to indemnification) and, to the extent successful, in connection with any litigation or arbitration with respect to such claim or the enforcement thereof.
 
(F) If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, or if a Change of Control shall have occurred and a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent requests pursuant to clause (2) of the second sentence in subsection (E) that the determination whether the claimant is entitled to indemnification be made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (in the case of a claimant who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) or by an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination (in the case of a claimant who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation), the claimant shall be conclusively presumed to have been determined pursuant to subsection (E) to be entitled to indemnification if (1)in the case of a claimant who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, (a)(i) within fifteen days after the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors following receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor, the Board of Directors shall not have resolved by majority vote of the Disinterested Directors to submit such determination to (x) Independent Counsel for its determination or (y) the shareowners for their determination at the next annual meeting, or any special meeting that may be held earlier, after such receipt, and (ii) within sixty days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor (or within ninety days after such receipt if the Board of Directors in good faith determines that additional time is required by it for the determination and, prior to expiration of such sixty-day period, notifies the claimant thereof), the Board of Directors shall not have made the determination by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, or (b) after a resolution of the Board of Directors, timely made pursuant to clause (a)(i)(y) above, to submit the determination to the shareowners, the shareowners meeting at which the determination is to be made shall not have been held on or before the date prescribed (or on or before a later date, not to exceed sixty days beyond the original date, to which such meeting may have been postponed or adjourned on good cause by the Board of Directors acting in good faith), or (2) in the case of a claimant who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, within sixty days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor (or within ninety days after such receipt if an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination in good faith determines that additional time is required for the determination and, prior to expiration of such sixty-day period, notifies the claimant thereof), an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination shall not have made the determination; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply if the claimant has misstated or failed to state a material fact in connection with his or her request for indemnification. Such presumed determination that a claimant is entitled to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made (I) at the end of the sixty-day or ninety-day period (as the case may be) referred to in clause (1)(a)(ii) or (2) of the immediately preceding sentence or (II) if the Board of Directors has resolved on a timely basis to submit the determination to the shareowners, on the last date within the period prescribed by law for holding such shareowners meeting (or a postponement or adjournment thereof as permitted above).
 
(G) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding to a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, promptly after receipt of a statement from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time stating in reasonable detail the expenses incurred, and to a person who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation as authorized by the chief executive officer of the Corporation or such other officer of the Corporation as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors; provided that in each case the Corporation shall have received an undertaking by or on behalf of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this section.
 
(H) The Board of Directors shall establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for indemnification pursuant to this section, determination of the entitlement of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these by-laws and shall be deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.

reasonable
(C) "Indemnitee" includes any person who was or is, or is threatened to be made, a witness in or a party to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation.
(D) "Proceeding" includes any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except one initiated by an Indemnitee unless the Board of Directors shall have authorized the commencement thereof.
SECTION 3. .
Submission and Determination of Claims
(A) To obtain indemnification or advancement of Expenses under Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request therefor, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to permit a determination as to whether and what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors (if the Indemnitee is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) or the officer of the Corporation authorized to make the determination as to whether an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (if the Indemnitee is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) thereof in writing if a determination in accordance with Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws is required.
(B) Upon written request by an Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 3(A) hereof a determination with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement thereto in the specific case, if required by the by-laws, shall be made in accordance with Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws, and, if it is so determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to the Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination, with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.
 
(C) If entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 3(C). If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and the Corporation shall give written notice to the Indemnitee advising the Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee (unless the Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors, in which event the immediately preceding sentence shall apply), and the Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Corporation advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, the Indemnitee or the Corporation, as the case may be, may, within seven days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Corporation or to the Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. If such written objection is made, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty days after the next regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting following submission by the Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 3(A) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Corporation or the Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Corporation or the Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom an objection is favorably resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws. The Corporation shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses (including without limitation any advance retainers reasonably required by counsel) of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws, and the Corporation shall pay all fees and expenses (including without limitation any advance retainers reasonably required by counsel) incident to the procedures of Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws and this Section 3(C), regardless of the manner in which Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. Upon the delivery of its opinion pursuant to Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws or, if earlier, the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 4(A)(3) of these Procedures, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
reasonable
(D) If a Change of Control shall have occurred, in making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification under the by-laws, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under the by-laws if the Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 3(A) hereof, and the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
 
SECTION 4. .
Review and Enforcement of Determination
(A) In the event that (1) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(G) of the by-laws, (2) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(C) or (D) of the by-laws within ten days after receipt by the Corporation of written request therefor, (3) a determination is made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under the by-laws, (4) the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws and such determination shall not have been made and delivered in a written opinion within ninety days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request for indemnification, or (5) payment of indemnification is not made within ten days after a determination has been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or within ten days after such determination is deemed to have been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(F) of the by-laws, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of the Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, the Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within one year following the date on which the Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 4(A). The Corporation shall not oppose the Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
(B) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.
 
(C) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) or (F) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4, absent (1) a misstatement or omission of a material fact in connection with the Indemnitee's request for indemnification, or (2) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
(D) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 that the procedures and presumptions of these Procedures are not valid, binding and enforceable, and shall stipulate in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of these Procedures.
(E) In the event that an Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 4, seeks to enforce the Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws or these Procedures in a judicial proceeding or arbitration, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in Section 2 of these Procedures) actually and reasonably incurred in such judicial proceeding or arbitration, but only if the Indemnitee prevails therein. If it shall be determined in such judicial proceeding or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.
SECTION 5. . These Procedures may be amended at any time and from time to time in the same manner as any by-law of the Corporation in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the by-laws; provided, however, that any amendment, modification, alteration or repeal of these Procedures that in any way diminishes, limits, restricts, adversely affects or eliminates any right of an indemnitee or his or her successors to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise shall be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish, limit, restrict, adversely affect or eliminate any such right with respect to any actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission then or previously existing, or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission.

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareowner's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this by-law to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareowner's notice required by this by-law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(B) . Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareowners as shall have been brought before the meeting by the Corporation pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.

In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of shareowners for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareowner may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the shareowner's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this by-law (including the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by paragraph (D) of this by-law), and updates and supplements thereof are delivered timely. To be timely, the shareowner's notice shall be delivered in writing to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such special meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment of a special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a shareowner's notice as described above. In addition, to be considered timely, a shareowner's notice shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting, any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Indemnification
(A) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under this section) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
(B) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under this section) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
 
(C) To the extent that a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (A) and (B), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such person in connection therewith. If any such person is not wholly successful in any such action, suit or proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters therein, the Corporation shall indemnify such person against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such person in connection with each claim, issue or matter that is successfully resolved. For purposes of this subsection and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.
(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to the extent any person is a witness in, but not a party to, any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under this section) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation such person shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such person in connection therewith.
 
(E) Indemnification under subsections (A) and (B) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, trustee, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (A) and (B). Such determination shall be made (1) if a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall not have occurred, (a) with respect to a person who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum or (ii) if there are no Disinterested Directors or, even if there are Disinterested Directors, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs, by (x) Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (y) the shareowners of the Corporation; or (b) with respect to a person who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, by the chief executive officer of the Corporation or by such other officer of the Corporation as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors; or (2) if a Change of Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel selected by the claimant in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, unless the claimant shall request that such determination be made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (in the case of a claimant who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) or by an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination (in the case of a claimant who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation), in which case it shall be made in accordance with clause (1) of this sentence. Any claimant shall be entitled to be indemnified against the expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such claimant in cooperating with the person or entity making the determination of entitlement to indemnification (irrespective of the determination as to the claimant's entitlement to indemnification) and, to the extent successful, in connection with any litigation or arbitration with respect to such claim or the enforcement thereof.
 
(F) If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, or if a Change of Control shall have occurred and a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent requests pursuant to clause (2) of the second sentence in subsection (E) that the determination whether the claimant is entitled to indemnification be made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (in the case of a claimant who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) or by an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination (in the case of a claimant who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation), the claimant shall be conclusively presumed to have been determined pursuant to subsection (E) to be entitled to indemnification if (1) in the case of a claimant who is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, (a)(i) within fifteen days after the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors following receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor, the Board of Directors shall not have resolved by majority vote of the Disinterested Directors to submit such determination to (x) Independent Counsel for its determination or (y) the shareowners for their determination at the next annual meeting, or any special meeting that may be held earlier, after such receipt, and (ii) within sixty days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor (or within ninety days after such receipt if the Board of Directors in good faith determines that additional time is required by it for the determination and, prior to expiration of such sixty-day period, notifies the claimant thereof), the Board of Directors shall not have made the determination by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, or (b) after a resolution of the Board of Directors, timely made pursuant to clause (a)(i)(y) above, to submit the determination to the shareowners, the shareowners meeting at which the determination is to be made shall not have been held on or before the date prescribed (or on or before a later date, not to exceed sixty days beyond the original date, to which such meeting may have been postponed or adjourned on good cause by the Board of Directors acting in good faith), or (2) in the case of a claimant who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, within sixty days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor (or within ninety days after such receipt if an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination in good faith determines that additional time is required for the determination and, prior to expiration of such sixty-day period, notifies the claimant thereof), an officer of the Corporation authorized to make such determination shall not have made the determination; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply if the claimant has misstated or failed to state a material fact in connection with his or her request for indemnification. Such presumed determination that a claimant is entitled to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made (I) at the end of the sixty-day or ninety-day period (as the case may be) referred to in clause (1)(a)(ii) or (2) of the immediately preceding sentence or (II) if the Board of Directors has resolved on a timely basis to submit the determination to the shareowners, on the last date within the period prescribed by law for holding such shareowners meeting (or a postponement or adjournment thereof as permitted above).
(G) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding to a present or former director or officer of the Corporation, promptly after receipt of a statement from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time stating in reasonable detail the expenses incurred, and to a person who is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation as authorized by the chief executive officer of the Corporation or such other officer of the Corporation as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors; provided that in each case the Corporation shall have received an undertaking by or on behalf of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this section.
 
(H) The Board of Directors shall establish reasonable procedures for the submission of claims for indemnification pursuant to this section, determination of the entitlement of any person thereto and review of any such determination. Such procedures shall be set forth in an appendix to these by-laws and shall be deemed for all purposes to be a part hereof.

(iii) Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or the acquisition of assets of another entity (a "Corporate Transaction"), in each case, unless, following such Corporate Transaction, (i) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Corporation Common Stock and Outstanding Corporation Voting Securities immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the Corporation or all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction, of the Outstanding Corporation Common Stock and Outstanding Corporation Voting Securities, as the case may be, (ii) no Person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Corporation or such corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Corporate Transaction and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board of Directors, providing for such Corporate Transaction; or

Purpose
SECTION 2. . For purposes of these Procedures:
Definitions
(A) All terms that are defined in Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws shall have the meanings ascribed to them therein when used in these Procedures unless otherwise defined herein.
(B) "Expenses" include all attorneys' fees, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, or being or preparing to be a witness in, a Proceeding; and shall also include such retainers as counsel may reasonably require in advance of undertaking the representation of an indemnitee in a Proceeding.
(C) "Indemnitee" includes any person who was or is, or is threatened to be made, a witness in or a party to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent (except in each of the foregoing situations to the extent any agreement, arrangement or understanding of agency contains provisions that supersede or abrogate indemnification under Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws) of another corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation.
(D) "Proceeding" includes any action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, except one initiated by an Indemnitee unless the Board of Directors shall have authorized the commencement thereof.
SECTION 3. .
Submission and Determination of Claims
(A) To obtain indemnification or advancement of Expenses under Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request therefor, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to permit a determination as to whether and what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors (if the Indemnitee is a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) or the officer of the Corporation authorized to make the determination as to whether an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (if the Indemnitee is not a present or former director or officer of the Corporation) thereof in writing if a determination in accordance with Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws is required.
(B) Upon written request by an Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 3(A) hereof a determination with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement thereto in the specific case, if required by the by-laws, shall be made in accordance with Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws, and, if it is so determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to the Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination, with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.
 
(C) If entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 3(C). If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and the Corporation shall give written notice to the Indemnitee advising the Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee (unless the Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors, in which event the immediately preceding sentence shall apply), and the Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Corporation advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, the Indemnitee or the Corporation, as the case may be, may, within seven days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Corporation or to the Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. If such written objection is made, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty days after the next regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting following submission by the Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 3(A) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Corporation or the Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Corporation or the Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom an objection is favorably resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws. The Corporation shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses (including without limitation any advance retainers reasonably required by counsel) of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws, and the Corporation shall pay all fees and expenses (including without limitation any advance retainers reasonably required by counsel) incident to the procedures of Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws and this Section 3(C), regardless of the manner in which Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. Upon the delivery of its opinion pursuant to Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws or, if earlier, the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 4(A)(3) of these Procedures, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
(D) If a Change of Control shall have occurred, in making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification under the by-laws, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall presume that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under the by-laws if the Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 3(A) hereof, and the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
 
SECTION 4. .
Review and Enforcement of Determination
(A) In the event that (1) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(G) of the by-laws, (2) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(C) or (D) of the by-laws within ten days after receipt by the Corporation of written request therefor, (3) a determination is made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under the by-laws, (4) the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws and such determination shall not have been made and delivered in a written opinion within ninety days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request for indemnification, or (5) payment of indemnification is not made within ten days after a determination has been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or within ten days after such determination is deemed to have been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(F) of the by-laws, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of the Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, the Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within one year following the date on which the Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 4(A). The Corporation shall not oppose the Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
(B) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.
 
(C) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Article III, Section 13(E) or (F) of the by-laws that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4, absent (1) a misstatement or omission of a material fact in connection with the Indemnitee's request for indemnification, or (2) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
(D) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 4 that the procedures and presumptions of these Procedures are not valid, binding and enforceable, and shall stipulate in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of these Procedures.
(E) In the event that an Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 4, seeks to enforce the Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, Article III, Section 13 of the by-laws or these Procedures in a judicial proceeding or arbitration, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in Section 2 of these Procedures) actually and reasonably incurred in such judicial proceeding or arbitration, but only if the Indemnitee prevails therein. If it shall be determined in such judicial proceeding or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.
SECTION 5. . These Procedures may be amended at any time and from time to time in the same manner as any by-law of the Corporation in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the by-laws; provided, however, that any amendment, modification, alteration or repeal of these Procedures that in any way diminishes, limits, restricts, adversely affects or eliminates any right of an indemnitee or his or her successors to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise shall be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish, limit, restrict, adversely affect or eliminate any such right with respect to any actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission then or previously existing, or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission.
