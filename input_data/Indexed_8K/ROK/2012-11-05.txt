Commenting on the results, Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and chief executive officer, said, I was pleased with 5 percent organic sales growth in the quarter, especially given the tough comparison to last year's very strong fourth quarter. While growth rates continued to moderate due to a difficult economic environment, once again every region delivered organic growth. We initiated restructuring actions that reduced margins in the quarter. Those actions provide us with some headroom to rebalance investments in 2013.
For the full year, we achieved record sales and earnings per share. Operating margin expanded by one point while we continued to invest for growth. Our EMEA region had a great year with 6 percent organic growth in the face of a recession. We continued our track record of returning cash to shareowners by increasing the dividend 11 percent and repurchasing 3.7 million shares.
"We delivered solid results in a challenging environment this year. I want to thank our employees for their dedication and our customers, suppliers and partners for their support throughout the year.

Changes to definition of segment operating earnings and introduction of new non-GAAP measures for fiscal 2013
Significant declines in interest rates over the past several years have caused an extraordinary increase in certain components of pension expense that the Company considers to be unrelated to its underlying operating performance. In order to provide transparency into the operating results of our business, beginning in fiscal 2013, the Company will provide non-GAAP earnings measures (Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS) that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related tax effects from income from continuing operations and corresponding earnings per share (EPS). The Company defines non-operating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. In addition, the Company will redefine segment operating earnings to exclude non-operating pension costs. Fiscal 2013 guidance is being provided for Adjusted EPS.
Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, free cash flow and return on invested capital are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release. Also included in the attachments to this release are reconciliations of redefined segment operating earnings and the new non-GAAP measures of Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS for the fiscal years 2010 - 2012. Quarterly and annual reconciliations of redefined segment operating earnings, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Income and an annual schedule of components of pension expense for the fiscal years 2008-2012 are provided in the Supplemental Financial Data document posted on Rockwell Automation's website at http://www.rockwellautomation.com/investors/.

Outlook
The Company is providing a fiscal 2013 sales outlook of $6.35 to $6.65 billion, which represents organic growth of 1 to 5 percent. Currency translation and acquisitions will add one point of growth. Based on this sales outlook, the Company is initiating fiscal 2013 Adjusted EPS guidance of $5.35 to $5.75, which compares to Adjusted EPS of $5.29 for fiscal 2012.
Commenting on the outlook, Nosbusch said, The sluggish global economy and a weaker solutions backlog are headwinds as we enter fiscal 2013. While we do expect sales to increase next year, the growth will likely be more weighted to the second half.
"We plan to invest in our best growth opportunities in 2013, but we will closely monitor business conditions and adjust as appropriate. While we can't control the economy, I believe we are well-positioned to outgrow the market with our innovative technology, domain expertise and thought leadership."
Conference Call
A conference call to discuss our financial results will take place at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time on
November 5, 2012
. The call and related financial charts will be webcast and accessible via the Rockwell Automation website (

Organic Sales
Our press release contains information regarding sales excluding the effect of changes in currency and organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales and sales excluding the effect of changes in currency as two measures to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

Free Cash Flow
Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. We account for share-based compensation under U.S. GAAP, which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows.
In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.
The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:
Return On Invested Capital
Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:
(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;
(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, multiplied by;
(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.
ROIC is calculated as follows:

Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS
Our press release contains financial information and earnings guidance regarding Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. We define non-operating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business. We believe that Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Our measure of Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations and diluted EPS.
The following is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations to Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS:

Reconciliation of Segment Operating Earnings
Beginning in fiscal 2013, we are changing our definition of segment operating earnings to exclude non-operating pension costs. Non-operating pension costs consist of defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. We will continue to include service cost and amortization of prior service cost in the business segment that incurred the expense.
The following is a reconciliation of reported segment operating earnings to adjusted segment operating earnings excluding non-operating pension costs:
1
Total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of the Company. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.
