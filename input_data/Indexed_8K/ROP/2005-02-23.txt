FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
reported record financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004.
Duluth, Georgia, February 23, 2005 ... Roper Industries, Inc. (NYSE: ROP)
Adjusted diluted earnings per share (DEPS) were $2.68 for the year, at the high end of the Company's original guidance range of $2.45-$2.70. These results exclude inventory revaluation charges related to the December 2003 acquisition of Neptune, and effects from the December 2004 acquisition of TransCore and related financing activities. Non-adjusted DEPS were $2.48, compared with $1.41 in the prior year, an increase of 76% (see Table 1 for a reconciliation of 2004 DEPS). Net sales for 2004 were $970 million, an increase of 48% over 2003 net sales of $657 million, and orders of $971 million represent a 50% increase over 2003.
In the fourth quarter, Roper reported adjusted DEPS of $0.80 and non-adjusted DEPS of $0.64 compared with non-adjusted DEPS of $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Roper achieved net sales of $277 million in the fourth quarter, a 63% increase over the fourth quarter of 2003. Fourth quarter results include 18% internal growth and solid contributions from acquisitions, including $15 million of net sales from TransCore (see Table 2 for more information). Fourth quarter orders increased 61% over the comparable 2003 quarter to $279 million and included internal growth of 14%.
"Our 2004 results reflect the successful execution of our growth strategy," said Brian Jellison, Roper's Chairman, President and CEO. "Our business units have expanded their markets, channels and product offerings, the portfolio is well-positioned in end markets with favorable growth drivers, and our disciplined acquisition program continues to create new growth paths for Roper. The result is significant growth, record earnings and particularly strong cash flow."
In 2004, Roper reported $214 million of adjusted EBITDA during the year, 73% higher than 2003 adjusted EBITDA of $124 million (see table 3 for calculations of adjusted EBITDA). Roper converted 176% of net earnings into cash flow from operating activities, generating $165 million of cash flow in 2004, 131% higher than the prior year. The Company produced $63 million of cash flow in the fourth quarter, which included $10 million contributed by TransCore.
The Company's focus on working capital produced substantial improvements in the quarter, including a record low amount of net working capital relative to sales. Due in part to strong cash flow performance, Roper ended the year with $129 million in cash and a net debt-to-net capital ratio of 40.6%, significantly improved from 47.0% at the beginning of the year.
2005 Outlook
In 2005, Roper expects to produce at least $314 million of EBITDA, which would represent an increase of more than $100 million over 2004 levels. The Company also forecasts over $225 million of cash flow from operating activities. Net sales are expected to exceed $1.37 billion, reflecting full year contributions from TransCore and continued internal growth. Despite the Company's forecast of higher interest and tax rates, the Company initiated full year 2005 DEPS guidance of $3.10-$3.30 and expects increasing quarterly performance throughout the year, similar to the quarterly improvement trends experienced in 2004. First quarter DEPS are expected to be $0.52-$0.56, which includes $0.04 of inventory revaluation charges related to the acquisition of TransCore.
"Roper is well-positioned to continue its record performance in 2005," said Mr. Jellison. "With the successful transformation of our business over the past few years, approximately 75% of our end markets are now in attractive RFID, energy, water and research markets with lower cyclical risk. We remain committed to continuing the great strides we have made in internal growth, working capital and cash flow. We are integrating TransCore into the Company with a focus on extending its technologies into targeted growth markets, such as automatic meter reading and security applications. We also see exciting opportunities for our disciplined acquisition process to supplement our existing growth platforms."
