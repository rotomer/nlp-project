Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 26, 2006, Roper Industries, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release containing information about the Company's results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as .
Exhibit 99.1
In the press release, the Company uses a non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net earnings plus (a) interest expense, (b) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is an important indicator of operational strength and performance of the Company's business because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow. EBITDA as calculated by the Company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In addition, EBITDA: (a) does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP; (b) is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's cash flow needs; and (c) should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or the Company's other financial information determined under GAAP. The Company believes that the line on the Company's consolidated statement of operations entitled net earnings is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA.

reported record results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2006. Net sales were up 17% to $427 million. Excluding acquisitions, sales were up 11%. Diluted earnings per share (DEPS) were $0.56, up from $0.45 in the third quarter 2005. Current year results include the effects from implementation of SFAS 123R and related equity compensation costs. The results also include the dilution from the Company's senior subordinated convertible notes. Without this dilution DEPS would have been $0.57 in the quarter.

"We are pleased to report strong sales and income growth during the quarter," said Brian Jellison, Roper's Chairman, President and CEO. "Operating margins expanded in all four segments reaching 20.5% for the Company, up 140 basis points from the prior year. Our internal growth and operating improvements drove EBITDA margins up to 25.4% in the third quarter 2006. Business conditions continue to be strong, and we closed the third quarter with a record $431 million in backlog."
Operating income was $88 million and net earnings grew 30% to $51 million. The Company reported third quarter EBITDA of $109 million. Net working capital was reduced 110 basis points to 16.3% of third quarter annualized 2006 sales. Net debt (debt minus cash) was reduced to 36.5% of total net capitalization.
Orders totaled $436 million for the quarter, up 7% and excluding the Radio Frequency (RF) segment, orders were up 18%. Industrial Technology was up 18%, Energy Systems up 12% and Scientific Imaging up 26%. While RF third quarter net orders were off 17% in the quarter, fourth quarter RF orders are expected to be up more than 30% from the comparable quarter in 2005. Despite the lumpy nature of RF segment quarterly net order numbers, the Company expects the 2006 RF segment net orders to be up 12% or more over 2005.
Roper is increasing its full year DEPS and EBITDA guidance, which does not include benefits from future acquisitions or the dilutive effects resulting from the Company's convertible notes. The Company is increasing its full year DEPS guidance from $2.05-$2.11 to $2.11-$2.15. In the first three quarters of 2006 the dilutive effect resulting from the Company's convertible notes totaled $0.03 per share or $0.01 per share per quarter. The Company is increasing its full year EBITDA guidance from $405+ million to $413+ million.
