Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 2.03.  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On July 7, 2008, the Company entered into a new unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaces its amended and restated secured credit facility, dated as of December 13, 2004. The new facility comprises (i) a two year $350.0 million term loan facility and (ii) a five year $750.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 million for letters of credit and $25.0 million for swingline loans and of which $50.0 million will be available under a multicurrency subfacility in dollars and other currencies. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350.0 million.
 
The Company and specified foreign subsidiaries are borrowers under the revolving credit facility. The Company has guaranteed the payment and performance by the foreign subsidiary borrowers under the facility.
 
Borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facilities will bear interest, at the Companys option, at a rate based on either:
 
 
 
Outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility will be charged a quarterly fee depending on the Companys senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  Based on the Companys current rating, the quarterly fee would be payable at a rate of 1.50% per annum, plus a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the outstanding amount of all letters of credit.
 
Additionally, the Company will pay a quarterly facility fee on the used and unused portions of the revolving credit facility depending on the Companys senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  Based on the Companys current rating, the quarterly fee would accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum.
 
Amounts outstanding under the new facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default.  The new facility contains financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain (i)a consolidated total leverage ratio (as defined) of no more than 3.5 to 1.0 and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined) of no less than 3.0 to 1.0.
 
 
A copy of the credit agreement with respect to the unsecured credit facility is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreement.

A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be presumed correct, subject to evidence to the contrary.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the relevant Borrower of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.

The Issuing Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent of the average daily outstanding amount of any Letter of Credit denominated in a foreign currency for any period in respect of which fees are payable and, upon request by the Administrative Agent, for any other date or period.  For all purposes of this Agreement, determinations by the Administrative Agent of the Dollar Equivalent of any amount expressed in a foreign currency shall be made on the basis of Exchange Rates reset monthly (or on such other periodic basis as shall be selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) and shall in each case be conclusive absent manifest error.
