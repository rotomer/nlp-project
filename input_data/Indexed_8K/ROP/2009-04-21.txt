Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure. 
 
In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 requires issuers to separately account for the liability and equity components of covered convertible debt instruments to reflect the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods.  We adopted FSP APB 14-1 on January 1, 2009, and are required to apply this standard on a retrospective basis.   Adoption of FSP APB 14-1 resulted in the following non-cash reductions in basic and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations.
