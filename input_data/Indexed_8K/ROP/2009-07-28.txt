Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Sarasota, Florida, July 28, 2009 ... Roper Industries, Inc.  (NYSE: ROP)
Net earnings for the second quarter were $60 million, or $0.64 per diluted share.  Orders increased 4% over the first quarter, and second quarter sales were $505 million, flat to the first quarter and a 15% decrease compared to the same period in 2008.  Operating margin was 19.0%, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter.  Excluding restructuring costs, adjusted operating margin was 19.8% compared to 17.9% in the first quarter.  Operating cash flow was $110 million, an increase of 15% from the prior year and a second quarter record for the Company.  Results for the quarter include a charge of $0.03 per share for restructuring expenses and a gain of $0.03 per share from the sale of certain assets of the Companys satellite communications business.
During the second quarter we fulfilled our commitment to execute efficiently in this challenging environment, said Brian Jellison, Ropers Chairman, President and CEO.  We are pleased with the performance of our businesses, particularly the improvements in gross margin, operating margin and cash generation.  Our asset-light business model continues to pay dividends, with record operating cash flow for the quarter resulting from strong earnings, high margins and continued working capital improvements.
Sales in the RF Technology segment increased 7% compared to the same period in 2008, while sales in the remaining segments declined from the prior year due to the continuing effects of the economic environment.  Decremental margin (change in operating profit divided by change in sales), excluding the RF segment was 30% in the quarter, including the cost of restructuring, and 27% excluding restructuring costs.  Our decremental margin performance was an improvement over our strong first quarter performance, and benefited from completed restructuring actions, said Mr. Jellison.
Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) reached 173% of net income in the quarter and is 134% of net income year-to-date.  The Company ended the quarter with over $750 million in cash and available liquidity. With the acquisition environment improving, we expect our liquidity position will serve us well as we pursue disciplined investments, Mr. Jellison concluded.
 
Outlook and Guidance
Roper is increasing its full year operating cash flow guidance from $325 million to $350 million.  The Company expects full-year earnings per diluted share between $2.60 and $2.72, excluding the impact of restructuring costs and future acquisitions.
