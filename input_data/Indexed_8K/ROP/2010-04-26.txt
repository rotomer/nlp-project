Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On April 26, 2010, Roper Industries, Inc. (the Company) issued a press release containing information about the Companys results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished as .
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
In the press release, the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. EBITDA is defined as net earnings plus (a) interest expense, (b) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is an important indicator of operational strength and performance of the Companys business because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow. EBITDA as calculated by the Company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In addition, EBITDA: (a) does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP; (b) is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Companys cash flow needs; and (c) should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or the Companys other financial information determined under GAAP. The Company believes that the line on the Companys consolidated statement of operations entitled net earnings is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA.
Free Cash Flow is defined as "Cash Provided by Operating Activities" ("Operating Cash Flow") as stated in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, reduced by capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.

Exhibit 99.1
 
reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Sarasota, Florida, April 26, 2010 ... Roper Industries, Inc.  (NYSE: ROP)
Net earnings for the first quarter were $60 million, or $0.62 per diluted share.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.65, which excludes a previously announced acquisition-related inventory charge of $0.03.  Orders were a record $567 million, an increase of 20% over the first quarter of the prior year.  Sales in the first quarter were $534 million, a 6% increase from the comparable period in 2009.  Operating cash flow was a record $95 million, an increase of 88% over the prior year quarter.
Adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 19.6% and operating margin as reported expanded 160 basis points to 18.8%.  During the quarter, EBITDA increased to $130 million, or 24.3% of sales.  Free Cash Flow was $89 million, representing 17% of sales and 148% of net earnings.
We are encouraged by both a 20% increase in orders and an acceleration of order growth during the quarter, putting us on track to generate record net earnings for the year, said Brian Jellison, Ropers Chairman, President and CEO.  In addition to the order growth, our businesses performed well in the quarter, with a consistent focus on cash and working capital management, resulting in record free cash flow.  Gross margins increased to 52.3%, reflecting strong execution and growth in higher margin businesses.
Our Verathon acquisition performed very well in its first full quarter as part of our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, with continued double-digit sales growth, continued Mr. Jellison.  During the quarter, we acquired the Heartscape product line, a technology we are enhancing to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting heart attacks.  Our acquisition pipeline is exciting and we expect to complete additional acquisitions during the year.
As a result of its strong first quarter performance and improving order trends, Roper is increasing its full year DEPS guidance to $2.95-$3.10 from $2.83-$3.03, and establishing second quarter DEPS guidance of $0.71-$0.75.  The Company is also increasing its guidance for operating cash flow to $400-$425 million, up from $375-$400 million.  The Companys guidance excludes the first quarter impact of acquisition-related inventory charges and any future acquisitions.
