Item 5.07     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
In a non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation paid to the Companys named executive officers (say-on-pay) held at the 2011 Annual Meeting, stockholders voted in favor of holding say-on-pay votes annually. Accordingly, in light of this result and other factors considered by the Board, the Board has determined that the Company will hold advisory say-on-pay votes on an annual basis until the next required vote on the frequency of such say-on-pay votes.
