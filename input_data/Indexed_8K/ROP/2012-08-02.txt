Closing
Optionholders
The aggregate purchase price payable to the Sellers and the Optionholders at Closing is $1.415 billion in cash subject to adjustment reflecting that the acquisition of Sunquest by the Company at Closing will be on a debt free, cash free basis with Sunquests transaction expenses borne by the Sellers.  In addition, the aggregate purchase price payable at Closing may be subject to adjustment up or down to reflect the difference between estimated working capital at Closing and a target working capital range. The Sellers and Optionholders have agreed to place a portion of the purchase price due to Sellers and Optionholders in escrow in connection with their indemnity obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement and for customary post-closing adjustments, if any, to the purchase price with respect to final determinations of Closing working capital and Closing cash amounts.
The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, the Sellers and Sunquest.  From the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement until the Closing, Sunquest is required to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and to comply with certain covenants regarding the operation of its business.  Subject to certain limitations, the Company will be indemnified for damages resulting from breaches of the Sellers or Sunquests representations, warranties and covenants made in the Stock Purchase Agreement, pre-closing taxes of Sunquest and its subsidiaries and certain other matters.
The Closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the ) and that employment agreements with certain key employees, and certain non-solicitation and non-compete agreements, are in full force and effect at the Closing.
HSR Act
The Stock Purchase Agreement provides for certain termination rights of the Company and Sellers including termination by the Sellers or the Company if the Closing has not been consummated on or before October 28, 2012, but only if the party terminating the Stock Purchase Agreement (and in the case of the Sellers, either the Sellers or Sunquest) has not materially breached the agreement and thereby prevented or frustrated the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement.

Computation of Interest and Fees
(a)  
.  
Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate and Loans denominated in Sterling, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-(or 366, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Parent Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurocurrency Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Parent Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
 
(b)
 
Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.

Inability to Determine Interest Rate
.  If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:

(a)  
 
the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period, or
 
(b)  
 
 the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
 
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If such notice is given (w) any Dollar Eurocurrency Loans under the relevant Facility requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (x) any ABR Loans under the relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurocurrency Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans, (y) any outstanding Dollar Eurocurrency Loans under the relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans and (z) any affected Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall automatically commence bearing interest at the Cost of Funds Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Dollar Eurocurrency Loans under any affected Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Parent Borrower have the right to convert Loans under any such Facility to Dollar Eurocurrency Loans.

pro
 
rata
according to the respective US$ Revolving Percentages or Multicurrency Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, of the relevant Lenders.
 
(b)
 
Each payment by any Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans under a particular Facility shall be made according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Revolving Lenders under such Facility.
pro
rata
 
(c)
 
All payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, Local Time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars or the relevant Alternative Currency and in immediately available funds.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(d)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in
 
 
 
28
 
 
 
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (or, in the case of Dollar-denominated Loans, if greater, the Federal Funds Effective Rate), for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans (or, in the case of Alternative Currency Loans, the relevant rate applicable thereto) under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the relevant Borrower.
 
(e)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the relevant Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the relevant Borrower hereunder that the relevant Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the relevant Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate (or, in the case of Alternative Currency Loans, the Cost of Funds Rate).  Nothing in this Section 2.16(e) shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrowers.

(i)
 
shall subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than Non-Excluded Taxes and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
(ii)
 
shall impose, modify or hold applicable any new reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate or otherwise assessed pursuant to Section 2.13(d) or Section 2.13(e); or
 
(iii)
 
shall impose on such Lender any other new condition;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect
 
 
 
29
 
 
thereof, then, in any such case, the relevant Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its written demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly certify in writing to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
 
(b)
 
If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such corporations capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or such corporations policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Parent Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written certification therefor, the Parent Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
 
(c)
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented.
 
(d)
 
A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be presumed correct, subject to evidence to the contrary.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the relevant Borrower of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  The obligations of the Borrowers pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b)
 
In addition, the Borrowers shall pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.

(d)
 
The Borrowers shall jointly and severally  indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as promptly as possible but in no event later than 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Non-Excluded Taxes (including Non-Excluded Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; , , that such indemnity shall not apply with respect to interest or penalties attributable to the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to timely notify such Borrower of the incurrence of any such taxes.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.18(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any

facility fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.7(a);
 
(b)
 
the Revolving Commitment and Revolving Extensions of Credit of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.1); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;
 
(c)
 
if such Defaulting Lender is a US$ Revolving Lender and any Swingline Exposure or L/C Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)  all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders that are US$ Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective US$ Revolving Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all US$ Revolving Extensions of Credit of the US$ Revolving Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all US$ Revolving Commitments of all non-Defaulting Lenders that are US$ Revolving Lenders;
 
(ii)   if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Parent Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8 for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;
 
(iii)  if the Parent Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(a) with respect to such
 
 
 
37
 
 
 
Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is cash collateralized;
 
(iv) if the L/C Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3(a) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders US$ Revolving Percentages; and
 
(v)  if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Lender until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
 
(d)
 
if such Defaulting Lender is a US$ Revolving Lender, so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the related exposure and such Defaulting Lenders then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the US$ Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders that are US$ Revolving Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.24(c), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders that are US$ Revolving Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.24(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender that is a US$ Revolving Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders US$ Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the US$ Revolving Loans of the other US$ Revolving Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its US$ Revolving Percentage.
 
 
3.1
 
L/C Commitment
(a)  
.  
As of the Closing Date, the letters of credit listed on Schedule 3.1 shall be deemed to have been issued hereunder and be deemed to be Letters of Credit for all purposes hereunder.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other US$ Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit (
Letters of Credit
) for the account of the Parent Borrower or, subject to Section 3.2, any Subsidiary on any Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Issuing Lender;
provided
that the Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the L/C Obligations (as determined by the Administrative Agent) would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available US$ Revolving Commitments would be less than zero.  Each Letter of Credit shall (i) provide for payment of drawings in Dollars or in a foreign currency reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance, or such longer annual periods as the Issuing Lender may agree, and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date,
provided
that any Letter of Credit with a term described in clause (x) above may provide for the renewal thereof for additional annual periods (which shall in no event extend
 
 
 
38
 
 
 
beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Lender, in its sole discretion, may issue one or more Letters of Credit, each with an expiration date extending beyond the Revolving Termination Date (each a 
Designated Letter of Credit
 and, collectively, the 
Designated Letters of Credit
); provided that on or before the date that is 120 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, to the extent that any Designated Letter of Credit remains outstanding, the applicable Borrower shall cash collateralize the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of all Designated Letters of Credit outstanding at such time in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.  In the event that the applicable Borrower fails to cash collateralize the outstanding Designated Letters of Credit by the date that is 90 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, each such outstanding Designated Letter of Credit shall automatically be deemed drawn in full and such Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan  to be funded by the Lenders on the date that is 90 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date to reimburse such drawing (with the proceeds of such Revolving Loan being used to cash collateralize outstanding Designated Letters of Credit as set forth above).  Subject to Section 2.3 and Section 5.2 hereof, the funding by a Lender of its pro rata share of such Revolving Loan to cash collateralize the outstanding Designated Letters of Credit on the Revolving Termination Date shall be deemed payment by such Lender in respect of its participation in each such Designated Letter of Credit.
 
(b)
 
The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law.
 
3.2
 
Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit
.  The Parent Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request.  Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the Parent Borrower.  The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Parent Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof.  The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof).  Any Subsidiary of the Parent Borrower may request the issuance of a Letter of Credit on the same terms as the Parent Borrower is entitled to do so, in which case the Parent Borrower shall be unconditionally liable in respect thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 whether or not the Parent Borrower authorized such Subsidiary to request such Letter of Credit.
 
3.3
 
Fees and Other Charges
(a)  
.  
The Parent Borrower will pay a fee on all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurocurrency Loans under the US$ Revolving Facility, shared ratably among the US$ Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.  In addition, the Parent Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.
 
(b)

39
 
 
 
Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.
 
(c)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, for purposes of calculating any fees payable on any Letter of Credit denominated in a foreign currency in respect of any Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall convert the amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit denominated in foreign currency into an amount of Dollars based upon the relevant Exchange Rate in effect for such day.  The Issuing Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent of the average daily outstanding amount of any Letter of Credit denominated in a foreign currency for any period in respect of which fees are payable and, upon request by the Administrative Agent, for any other date or period.  For all purposes of this Agreement, determinations by the Administrative Agent of the Dollar Equivalent of any amount expressed in a foreign currency shall be made on the basis of Exchange Rates reset monthly (or on such other periodic basis as shall be selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) and shall in each case be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
3.4
 
L/C Participations
(a)  
.  
The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participants own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participants US$ Revolving Percentage in the Issuing Lenders obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder.  Each L/C Participant agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Parent Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (or in the event that any reimbursement received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by it at any time), such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lenders address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participants US$ Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed (which obligations shall be expressed in Dollars at the Exchange Rate on the date of payment by the Issuing Lender of such draft under any Letter of Credit).  Each L/C Participants obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender, the Parent Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Parent Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Parent Borrower, any other Borrower or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
 
(b)
 
If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due (which shall be on the date of demand by the relevant Issuing Bank so long as such demand is made on or before 3:00 P.M. New York City time, otherwise on the next Business Day), such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360.  If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such
 
 
 
40
 
 
 
due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the US$ Revolving Facility.  A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
 
(c)
 
Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Parent Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its share thereof; , , that in the event that any such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.

Reimbursement Obligation of the Parent Borrower.
 
(a) If any draft is paid under any Letter of Credit, the Parent Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of (x) the draft so paid and (y) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, not later than 12:00 Noon, Local Time, on (i) the Business Day that the Parent Borrower receives notice of such draft, if such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00 A.M., Local Time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that the Parent Borrower receives such notice.  Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (x), in the case of Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit including those converted pursuant to Section 3.5(b) hereof (1) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, Section 2.13(b) and (2) thereafter, Section 2.13(c) and (y) in the case of foreign currency-denominated Letters of Credit, the rate which would reasonably and customarily be charged by the Issuing Lender on outstanding loans denominated in the relevant foreign currency plus, from and after the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, 2%.
 
(b)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3, prior to demanding any reimbursement from any L/C Participant in respect of any Letter of Credit denominated in a foreign currency, the Issuing Lender shall convert the amount of the Parent Borrowers obligation under Section 3.5 to reimburse the Issuing Lender in such foreign currency into an obligation to reimburse the Issuing Lender (and, in turn, the L/C Participants) in Dollars.  The amount of any such converted obligation shall be computed based upon the relevant Exchange Rate (as quoted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Lender) in effect for the day on which such conversion occurs.
 
3.6
 
Obligations Absolute
.  The Parent Borrowers obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Parent Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.  The Parent Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Parent Borrowers Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Parent Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Parent Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.  The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing
 
 
 
41
 
 
 
Lender.  The Parent Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Parent Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender to the Parent Borrower.
 
3.7
 
Letter of Credit Payments
.  If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Parent Borrower of the date and amount thereof.  The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Parent Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit.

The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent Borrower as at March 31, 2012, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-month period ended on such date, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Parent Borrower, as at such date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the three-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments).  All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein), subject, in the case of the quarterly financial statements referred to in the preceding sentence, to the normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes.
