Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
Newark, California, May 20, 2003 
Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) today reported that earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 3, 2003 increased 7% to $.63, from $.59 for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2002. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2003 were $49.3 million, up from $47.7 million in the prior year period. Sales for the first quarter ended May 3, 2003 increased 7% to $879 million, from $820 million for the quarter ended May 4, 2002. Comparable store sales for the same period declined 3% from the prior year.
 
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased to report that strong inventory and expense controls, as well as the earlier-than-planned opening of several new stores, offset the impact of lower-than-expected revenue on first quarter earnings. External issues, including unseasonable weather trends, the war in Iraq and the lackluster economic climate, negatively affected business during the period. Despite these pressures, however, we were able to show respectable earnings per share growth."
 
Mr. Balmuth continued, "Expense trends improved during the first quarter, due mainly to lower incentive plan costs, combined with better than planned store payroll and benefit expenses. As a result, a 48 basis point decline in general, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales partially offset an 86 basis point decline in gross margin. Operating margin for the first quarter was 9.2% compared to 9.6% in the prior year."
 
"Consistent with our long-term plan for 12% annual unit growth, we expect to add about 62 stores in 2003. Twenty-three of these new locations opened during the first quarter, including our initial entry into the state of Tennessee. We ended the period with 530 stores in 24 states," noted Mr. Balmuth.
 
Mr. Balmuth continued, "We remain committed to returning capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs. During the first three months of 2003, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $40.7 million under the two-year $300 million program authorized by our Board of Directors in early 2002. We ended the quarter with 76.7 million shares of
common stock outstanding and approximately $109 million remaining under this repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete in fiscal 2003."
 
The Company will provide additional details concerning its first quarter results and business outlook for the balance of 2003 on a conference call to be held on Tuesday, May 20, 2003 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Participants may listen to a real time audio webcast of the conference call by visiting the Company's web site located at www.rossstores.com.
