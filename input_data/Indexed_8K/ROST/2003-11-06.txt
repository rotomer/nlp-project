For the 13 weeks ended November 1, 2003, sales totaled $977 million, compared to $870 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2002, or an increase of 12% on top of 18% growth in the prior year.  Comparable store sales for the third quarter grew 2% on top of a 7% increase in the third quarter of 2002.
 
Sales for the first nine months of 2003 rose 10% on top of a 20% gain in the prior year.  For the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2003, sales totaled $2.822 billion, compared to $2.567 billion for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2002.  Year-to-date, comparable store sales were flat versus a robust 9% gain for the same period in 2002.
 
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "Same store sales in October underperformed our expectations primarily due to the effect unseasonably warm weather had on fall apparel sales throughout many of our western and southwestern markets.  California was particularly hard hit, due to the combination of abnormally warm temperatures and the major wildfires in our Los Angeles and San Diego markets, where the Company operates about 100 locations."

Mr. Balmuth continued, "We are pleased to report that ongoing effective inventory and expense controls helped to mitigate the impact on earnings of the mainly weather-related sales shortfall for October.   As a result, we now estimate that earnings per share will increase about 14% to approximately $.65 for the 13 weeks ended November 1, 2003.  These forecasted results are on top of a 33% gain in the third quarter of 2002, when the Company reported earnings per share of $.57.   We expect to report final 2003 third quarter results on Tuesday, November 18, 2003."
 
"Looking ahead to the holiday season, we are maintaining our prior forecast for same store sales to increase 3% to 4% for the fourth quarter and continue to estimate that earnings per share will be in the range of $.85 to $.88," said Mr. Balmuth.
 
"We remain on track with the development of our new concept, which will operate under the name, "".  As previously announced, we planthe first ten locations on the West Coast during the second half of 2004.  The combination of forecasted store growth for Ross and the new concept is expected to result in total estimated unit growth of 14% in 2004"
