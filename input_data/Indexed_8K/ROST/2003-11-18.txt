For the 39 weeks ended November 1, 2003, earnings per share increased 12% to $1.99.

Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our ongoing ability to deliver competitive discounts on a wide array of exciting name brand fashions for the family and the home resulted in respectable sales increases during the third quarter.  Business benefited from strong same store sales gains in our Home departments and the back-to-school categories of Juniors, Shoes and Accessories. In addition, continued effective control of both inventories and expenses contributed to stable operating margins and healthy earnings growth for the period."
