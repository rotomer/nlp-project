For the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2004, earnings per share grew 17% to a record $1.47 on top of a 32% gain in earnings per share in the prior year.  For the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2003, earnings per share were $1.26.   Net earnings for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2004 increased 13% to $228.1 million, compared to $201.2 million for the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2003.  Sales for the 2003 fiscal year rose 11% to $3.921 billion, with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 7% gain in the prior year.
 
We are pleased with the solid sales and earnings gains we posted during the fourth quarter and fiscal 2003, which reflect our strengthening momentum as the year progressed.  The strongest geographic markets in the fourth quarter were Arizona, Texas, the Southeast and California, all posting solid same store sales gains in the mid to high single digits.  The strongest merchandise departments were Home, Accessories and Juniors, with comparable store sales gains in the high single digits for the quarter."
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "
 
Mr. Balmuth continued, "Fourth quarter results benefited from a 104 basis point expansion in operating margin to 11.0%, reflecting our continued effective inventory and expense controls.  Gross margin increased 93 basis points, mainly due to lower markdowns, while selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 11 basis points, primarily due to leverage on the comparable store sales gain during the period."
Mr. Balmuth continued, "During fiscal 2003, cash flow from operations funded capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as the Company's stock repurchase and dividend programs.  We repurchased 6.9 million shares of common stock during fiscal 2003 for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million, ending the year with 151.2 million shares of common stock outstanding.   We also recently announced that our Board of Directors approved a record 48% increase in the Company's quarterly cash dividend to $.0425 per common share in addition to a new two-year $350 million stock repurchase program for 2004 and 2005.  These actions reflect the Board's and management's ongoing commitment to enhancing stockholder value, as well as our confidence in the Company's long-term growth prospects."
 
new retail concept targeting the needs of lower-income households, are targeted to open in the second half of the year," said Mr. Balmuth.
"Our accelerated expansion program also remains on track.  We added a record 61 net new stores during 2003, or unit growth of 12%.  Expansion into new geographic markets continued, with 21 of these additions in our relatively new Southeast states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee.
