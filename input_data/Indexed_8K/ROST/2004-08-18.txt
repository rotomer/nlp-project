Exhibit 99.1
___________________________________________________
Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2004 of $.22, compared to $.35 for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2003.  Net earnings for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004 were $32.6 million, compared to $54.6 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2003.  All earnings results reported for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 are inclusive of a previously-announced non-cash charge of $.07 per share, or $11.0 million in net income, related to the write-down of the Company's former corporate office and distribution center in Newark, California.  They are also consistent with the Company's previous estimates.  Current year second quarter sales rose 4% to $1.009 billion, from $966 million for the quarter ended August 2, 2003.  Comparable store sales for the period declined 3% from the prior year.
          Pleasanton, California, August 18, 2004 --
          For the six months ended July 31, 2004, earnings per share totaled $.53, compared to $.67 for the six months ended August 2, 2003.  Net earnings for the six months ended July 31, 2004 were $81.1 million, compared to $103.9 million for the same period in the prior year.  Again, results for the first six months of 2004 are inclusive of the previously referenced charge.  Sales for the first six months rose 8% to $2.000 billion, with same store sales flat to the prior year period.
          Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "As previously reported, we believe our business in the second quarter was affected by problems associated with our new Core Merchandising System and the resulting limitations these placed on our ability to identify and respond to changes in customer trends  especially in what appears recently to be a more difficult retail climate.  This situation resulted in below-plan sales and a decline in gross margin.  Selling, general and administrative costs also deleveraged due to the decline in comparable store sales."
          "We made progress during the quarter in resolving many of the problems we have experienced with this new system.  As previously reported, information to support the allocation function has been back to normal since early June. We continue to make progress addressing the information requirements most important to the buying process and believe that most of these data needs will be addressed in the next few weeks, with some planned to be complete later in the third quarter.  Although we expect sales to begin to gradually improve once these system issues have been remedied, we anticipate that there will be a residual impact to sales and earnings throughout the second half of 2004 as we cycle through merchandise imbalances that resulted from this situation," said Mr. Balmuth.

          Mr. Balmuth continued, "Strong cash flows continue to provide the resources to fund capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as the Company's stock repurchase and dividend programs.  During the first six months of 2004, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $124 million under the two-year $350 million program authorized by our Board of Directors in early 2004.  We ended the quarter with 147.5 million shares of common stock outstanding." 
          "Looking ahead, our healthy financial position provides us with a solid foundation on which to grow.  We still expect to open 80 net locations in 2004 to end the year with 648 stores in 26 states and Guam, or square footage expansion of 14%."
          "Last week, the first three of ten planned initial dd's DISCOUNTS stores had their grand openings in Northern California.  This exciting new off-price concept delivers exceptional values to consumers with household incomes of $30,000 to $40,000, one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country.  With a potential of at least 500 locations, we believe dd's DISCOUNTS has the ability to significantly enhance our growth prospects over the next five to ten years," noted Mr. Balmuth.
