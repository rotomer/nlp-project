Exhibit 99.1
__________________________________________________________
          -- Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported net earnings for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2005 of $49.4 million and earnings per share of $.33.  These fourth quarter results are inclusive of a non-cash lease accounting charge of $2.3 million to net earnings, or approximately $.02 per share.  For the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2004, the Company generated $71.3 million in net earnings and $.46 in earnings per share, which reflects the expected restatement of last year's results to reduce net earnings by about $2.4 million, or $.02 per share, from applying the corrective adjustment in lease accounting. 
Pleasanton, California, March 16, 2005
           For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005, net earnings totaled $168.5 million, and earnings per share were $1.12, which also includes the above-referenced non-cash corrective accounting adjustment of $.02 per share. In addition, fiscal 2004 results include a non-cash charge of approximately $.06 per share to write-down the value of the Company's former headquarters and distribution center in Newark, California to its estimated fair market value. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, net earnings totaled $225.7 million, and earnings per share were $1.45, again reflecting a reduction of about $.02 due to the adjustment in lease accounting.
          As previously announced, in response to recent SEC communications, the Company has adjusted the way it accounts for its operating leases, including the accounting for "rent holidays" and tenant allowances.  The Company expects to report a cumulative, non-cash charge to earnings per share through fiscal 2002 of $.05.  The Company plans to restate its financial statements for its fiscal years 2003 and prior, which will be reflected in the Company's Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended January 29, 2005.    
          Sales for the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005 increased 10% to $1.212 billion with comparable store sales flat to the prior year.   For the fiscal 2004 year ended January 29, 2005, sales increased 8% to $4.240 billion with comparable store sales down 1% from the prior year.

          Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Fiscal 2004 was a challenging year.  Difficulties associated with the implementation and integration of new information systems and distribution centers resulted in below plan sales and a contraction in profit margins.  As previously reported, by the end of fiscal 2004 we were essentially complete with the remediation of the remaining merchant reporting issues related to our Core Merchandising System.  We also have initiatives in place to roll out engineered standards throughout our distribution network by early 2006, which we believe will eventually result in a gradual improvement of distribution productivity."
          Mr. Balmuth continued, "The in-store merchandise imbalances that resulted from our system problems in 2004 continued to negatively impact both sales and operating margin during the fourth quarter.  Gross margin declined about 450 basis points as a percent of sales, mainly due to higher markdowns, an increase in distribution costs, and the deleveraging effect on occupancy and buying expenses from flat same store sales during the period.  The lower gross margin was partially offset by a 55 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales, mainly due to lower incentive plan costs during the period."
          "Strong operating cash flows continued to provide the resources to fund capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as the Company's stock repurchase and dividend programs.  During fiscal 2004, $147 million in capital expenditures supported the addition of 71 net new Ross locations and ten dd's DISCOUNTS stores, along with continued investments in infrastructure.  We also repurchased 6.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase of $175 million under the two-year $350 million program authorized by our Board of Directors in early 2004," Mr. Balmuth said.

          "In addition, initial customer response to dd's DISCOUNTS appears to be favorable.  During the third quarter of 2004, we opened the first ten of these new concept stores, which feature competitive everyday discounts on moderate department and discount store brands.  We are targeting customers with household incomes of $30,000 to $40,000, one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country.  Ultimately, we believe that dd's DISCOUNTS has the potential to become a chain of at least 500 locations," noted Mr. Balmuth.
