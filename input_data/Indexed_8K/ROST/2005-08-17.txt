Exhibit 99.1
Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2005 of $.29, compared to $.21 as restated for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2004.  Net earnings for the second quarter ended July 30, 2005 were $42.3 million, compared to $32.2 million as restated for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2004.  Earnings results for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 included a non-cash, after-tax charge of $11.0 million, or $.07 per share, related to the write-down of the Company's former corporate headquarters and distribution center in Newark, California.  Current year second quarter sales rose 16% to $1.172 billion, from $1.009 billion for the quarter ended July 31, 2004.  Comparable store sales for the period increased 7% over the prior year.
          Pleasanton, California, August 17, 2005 --
          For the six months ended July 30, 2005, earnings per share totaled $.62, compared to $.53 as restated for the six months ended July 31, 2004.  Net earnings for the six months ended July 30, 2005 were $92.3 million, compared to $80.4 million as restated for the same period in the prior year.  Again, results for the first six months of 2004 included the charge relating to the former headquarters and distribution center.  Sales for the first six months of 2005 rose 15% to $2.296 billion, with same store sales up 5% over the prior year period.
          Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Sales trends improved during the quarter, led by strength in Juniors and Shoes, which we believe bodes well for our back-to-school business.  At the same time, operating margin continued to be affected by higher-than-expected markdowns combined with an increase in distribution center costs as a percent of sales.  While partially offset by leverage on occupancy and other expenses from the 7% gain in same store sales, these factors resulted in an approximate 120 basis point decline in operating margin for the second quarter of 2005, excluding the prior year impact of the aforementioned write-down."

          "Markdowns year-to-date have consistently been higher than planned.  Although residual inventory issues from 2004 and modest volatility around actual-versus-plan sales had an impact on markdown activities, we believe that the internal learning curve related to numerous new system processes, procedures and information flow also has contributed to higher markdown levels.  We believe we have addressed most of these transitional issues and that their overall impact on margins should diminish going forward.  Nevertheless, as previously reported, higher-than-expected clearance balances at the end of the second quarter are expected to pressure both third quarter gross margin and earnings per share," said Mr. Balmuth.
          The Company now projects the following same store sales and earnings per share ranges for the balance of fiscal 2005:
          Mr. Balmuth concluded, "Solid cash flows year-to-date continue to provide the resources to fund capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, as well as the Company's stock repurchase and dividend programs.  During the first six months of 2005, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $89.0 million and ended the quarter with 146.2 million shares of common stock outstanding.  Approximately $86 million remains available under the current stock repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of fiscal 2005." 
          The Company will provide additional details concerning its second quarter results, projected second half guidance and its longer-term business outlook on a conference call to be held on Wednesday, August 17, 2005 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
