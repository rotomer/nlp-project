-- Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported that net earnings for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2006 increased 37% to $71.0 million, compared to $51.8 million for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2005.  Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2006 grew 40% to $.49, compared to earnings per share of $.35 for the prior year period. 
          Pleasanton, California, March 15, 2006
          For the 2005 fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, net earnings totaled $199.6 million, and earnings per share were $1.36, compared to net earnings of $169.9 million and earnings per share of $1.13 for the 2004 fiscal year ended January 29, 2005.  Fiscal 2004 results include a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $15.8 million, or $.06 per share, to write-down the value of the Company's former headquarters and distribution center in Newark, California to its estimated fair market value.  
          Sales for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006 increased 16% to $1.411 billion, with comparable store sales up 6% over the prior year.   For the 2005 fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, sales increased 17% to $4.944 billion, with comparable store sales up 6% over the prior year.
          Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased with the solid earnings growth we realized in the fourth quarter of 2005, which was driven by a combination of strong sales gains and expansion in operating margin.  Gross profit margin for the quarter rose about 185 basis points, partially offset by an approximate 70 basis point increase in selling, general and administrative expenses mainly related to higher incentive plan costs."
          Mr. Balmuth continued, "For the full 2005 fiscal year, earnings benefited from a solid rebound in sales, partially offset by a combination of higher-than-expected markdowns related to transitional systems and distribution issues earlier in the year, higher expenses related to inventory shortage, and higher incentive plan and information technology costs compared to fiscal 2004."    
          "We are pleased to report that healthy operating cash flows during 2005 continued to provide the resources to fund capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure.  During fiscal 2005, $176 million in capital expenditures supported the addition of 75 net new Ross locations, ten dd's DISCOUNTS stores, the purchase of a new warehouse facility in Moreno Valley, California, and other various information technology and infrastructure investments," said Mr. Balmuth.
          "We also continued to enhance stockholder value through our share repurchase and dividend programs.  During 2005, we completed the two-year $350 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2004, buying back a total of 6.4 million shares of common stock in 2005, for an aggregate purchase of $175 million.  In addition, in November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a new $400 million two-year stock repurchase program for 2006 and 2007 and approved a 20% increase in our quarterly cash dividend," Mr. Balmuth concluded. 
          The Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, March 15, 2006 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to communicate additional details concerning the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 results and management's outlook and plans for 2006.  A real time audio webcast of the conference call will be available at www.rossstores.com.  An audio playback will be available at (402) 220-5900, PIN #2342 through March 22, 2006.
