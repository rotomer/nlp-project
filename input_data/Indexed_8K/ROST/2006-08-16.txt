          Pleasanton, California, August 16, 2006 --
          For the six months ended July 29, 2006, earnings per share were $.73 and net earnings totaled $104.6 million.  These results are after $6.8 million, or an equivalent of about $.03 per share, in stock option related expenses recognized pursuant to FAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."  For the six months ended July 30, 2005, net earnings totaled $92.3 million, and earnings per share were $.62.   Sales for the first six months of 2006 increased 13% to $2.600 billion, with comparable store sales for the period up 5% on top of a 5% gain in the prior year.  
          Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Second quarter sales and earnings were at the high end of our initial forecast for the period, benefiting from broadbased geographic and merchandise trends.   Operating margin, before the effect of stock option related expenses was relatively flat to the prior year.  As a percent of sales, improvements in distribution costs and merchandise margin were offset by higher shrink accruals, freight, store and occupancy expenses."
          Mr. Balmuth continued, "Our balance sheet and cash flows as we ended the first half of the year remain strong and healthy.  We continue to return capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs.  During the first six months of 2006, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $99 million as part of the two-year $400 million program authorized by our Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Approximately $301 million remains available under the current stock repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of fiscal 2007." 
          On a more current note, Mr. Balmuth said, "Same store sales for the first two weeks of August were below plan at up 2% from the prior year.  In addition, we are entering the fall season with residual inventory and clearance levels that are expected to pressure gross margin during the third quarter.  As a result, we are adopting a more conservative outlook for the second half of the year."  
          The Company now projects the following same store sales and earnings per share ranges for the balance of fiscal 2006:
          The Company will provide additional details concerning its second quarter results, projected second half guidance and its longer-term business outlook on a conference call to be held on Wednesday, August 16, 2006 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
