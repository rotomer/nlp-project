_____________________________________________________
-- Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported sales of $438 million for the four weeks ended October 28, 2006, a 9% increase over the  $402 million in sales for the four weeks ended October 29, 2005.  Comparable store sales during October rose 3% on top of a 7% gain in the prior year. 
          Pleasanton, California, November 2, 2006
          For the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2006, sales rose 10% to $1.362 billion, compared to $1.237 billion for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2005.  Comparable store sales for the third quarter increased 4% on top of a strong 9% gain in the prior year period. 
          Sales for the nine months ended October 28, 2006 rose 12% to $3.962 billion, compared to $3.533 billion for the nine months ended October 29, 2005.  Year-to-date, comparable store sales increased 5% on top of a 6% gain in the prior year period. 
          Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Sales in October performed in line with our expectations.  The month benefited from broadbased geographic trends and ongoing strength in the Home and Shoe businesses.  We now estimate that earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2006 will increase 20% to 24% to $.30 to $.31, benefiting from a combination of better-than-planned sales, an improvement in shrink results and lower-than-planned markdowns.  Our updated third quarter 2006 estimate is inclusive of projected non-cash charges equivalent to about $.01 to $.02 per share related to stock option expensing.  Earnings per share in the third quarter of 2005 were $.25 cents." 
          Looking ahead, Mr. Balmuth said, "While we continue to project fourth quarter same store sales gains of 1% to 3% on top of a strong 6% increase in the prior year, based on the recent improvement in both shrink and markdowns, we are increasing our forecast for fourth quarter earnings per share by $.02 for an updated projected range of $.59 to $.65."
