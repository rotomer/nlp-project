          Pleasanton, California, November 14, 2006 --
          For the nine months ended October 28, 2006, earnings per share grew 20% to $1.04 from $.87 for the nine months ended October 29, 2005.  Net earnings for the fiscal 2006 year-to-date period were $148.5 million, compared to $128.7 million for the same period in the prior year.   The fiscal 2006 year-to-date results include pre-tax stock option related expenses of $10.0 million, or about $.04 per share, recognized pursuant to FAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."   Before these non-cash charges, earnings per share for the first nine months of 2006 grew 24% over the prior year.  Sales for the first nine months rose 12% to $3.962 billion, with same store sales up 5% on top of a 6% increase in the prior year comparable period.
          Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Third quarter earnings were better than planned, benefiting from healthy sales trends and a measurable improvement in operating margin.  Regionally, the strongest sales performance during the quarter was in the Southwest and Texas, while Home and Shoes remained the top-performing merchandise categories.  Before approximately 25 basis points in stock option-related costs, earnings before interest and taxes increased about 65 basis points during the quarter.  Improvements over the prior year period in shrink-related expenses and selling, general and administrative costs were partially offset by higher supply chain and incentive plan costs along with slight increases in markdown and occupancy expenses.  Better-than-plan shrink results from our recent annual physical inventory of our merchandise contributed about $.02 to our improved earnings per share during the quarter."
          "Our balance sheet and cash flows as we ended the third quarter remain solid and healthy, and we continue to return capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs.  During the first nine months of 2006, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $147.7 million as part of the two-year $400 million program authorized by our Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2005.  We ended the third quarter with 139.9 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  Approximately $252.3 million remains available under the current stock repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of fiscal 2007." 
          The Company will provide additional details concerning its third quarter results and business outlook on a conference call to be held on Tuesday, November 14, 2006 at 12:00 noon Eastern time.  Participants may listen to a real time audio webcast of the conference call by visiting the Company's website located at www.rossstores.com.
