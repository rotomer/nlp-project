Exhibit 99.1
     
Pleasanton, California, March 21, 2007
-- Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported that earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2007 grew 35% to $.66, compared to earnings per share of $.49 for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2006. Net earnings for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2007 were $93.1 million compared to $71.0 million for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2006. Sales for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2007 increased 14% to $1.608 billion. Comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2007 grew 1% on top of a 6% increase in the prior year.
     
For the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007, earnings per share grew 25% to $1.70 from $1.36 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006. Net earnings for the 53 weeks ended February
3, 2007 were a record $241.6 million compared to $199.6 million for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006. Sales for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 increased 13% to $5.570 billion. Same store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2007 were up 4% on top of a 6% increase in the prior year.
     
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased with the solid earnings growth we achieved in the fourth quarter and the year. Sales during the important holiday season were in line with expectations, benefiting from strength in the Mid Atlantic and Southwest regions and healthy gains in our Home and Shoe businesses. Operating margin in the fourth quarter grew by about 115 basis points, driven by a 60 basis point improvement in gross margin and a decline of about 55 basis points in selling, general and administrative expenses."

Mr. Balmuth continued, "For the full year, earnings benefited from healthy top line growth and a 40 basis point increase in operating margin. Improved profitability was driven mainly by increased gross margin, which benefited from lower markdowns, distribution costs and shortage accrual as a percent of sales, more than offsetting higher freight costs and stock option-related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were flat to the prior year."
     
"Strong operating cash flows during 2006 continued to provide the resources to fund capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure. During fiscal 2006, $224 million in capital expenditures supported the addition of 57 net new Ross locations, 6 dd's DISCOUNTS
stores, the buyout of the lease for our Southeast distribution center in South Carolina, and other various information technology and infrastructure investments," said Mr. Balmuth.
     
"We also continued to enhance stockholder value through our share repurchase and dividend programs. During 2006, we repurchased a total of 7.1 million shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million. During 2007, we expect to complete the $200 million remaining authorization on our $400 million two-year stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2005. In addition, in January 2007, our Board approved a 25% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.075 per share, our thirteenth consecutive annual dividend increase," Mr. Balmuth concluded.
     
The Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, March 21, 2007 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to communicate additional details concerning the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 results and management's outlook and plans for 2007.
