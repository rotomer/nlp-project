Exhibit 99.1
     
Pleasanton, California, May 23, 2007 --
Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2007 of $.48, compared to $.41 for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2006. Net earnings for the first quarter of 2007 were $67.0 million, compared to $59.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. Sales for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2007 were $1.4 billion, up 9% versus the first quarter in fiscal 2006. Comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2007 were flat compared to the 13 weeks ended May 6, 2006. For the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2006, comparable store sales rose 6%.
     
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "First quarter earnings were driven by a combination of top line growth and expansion in operating margin. Same store sales for the quarter were slightly below our projection of a 1% to 2% increase, due to our sales shortfall in April. We believe April was affected by a larger-than-expected impact from the Easter calendar shift and unseasonable weather during the first two weeks. Geographic and merchandise trends during the quarter were relatively broadbased. The best performing markets were on the west coast, while Home and Dresses were the strongest merchandise departments."
     
Mr. Balmuth continued, "Operating margin for the period grew about 30 basis points to 7.7%, benefiting from a 60 basis point gain in gross margin that was partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. These results were mainly due to higher merchandise gross margin and reductions as a percent of sales in distribution and buying costs. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight and the deleveraging effect of flat comparable store sales on store and occupancy expenses."

Mr. Balmuth also noted, "Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We continued to return capital to stockholders during the quarter through our stock repurchase and dividend programs. During the first three months of fiscal 2007, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $51 million. We are on track to repurchase the remaining $149 million of our two-year $400 million program authorized by our Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2005."
     
Looking ahead, Mr. Balmuth said, "For the second quarter ending August 4, 2007, we are forecasting same store sales gains of 1% to 2% and earnings per share in the range of $.35 to $.37. For the second half of 2007, same store sales are forecasted to grow 3% to 4%, based on merchandising opportunities we have identified for the fall season as well as easier prior year sales comparisons. We also continue to project earnings per share for fiscal 2007 that are within the range of our original guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 for the 52 weeks ending February 2, 2008."
