Exhibit 99.1
     
Pleasanton, California, August 22, 2007 --
Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended August 4, 2007 of $.37 and net earnings of $50.9 million. For the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2006, earnings per share were $.32 and net earnings totaled $45.4 million. Fiscal 2007 second quarter sales increased 10% to $1.445 billion, with comparable store sales for the period up 2% on top of a 4% increase in the prior year.
     
For the six months ended August 4, 2007, earnings per share were $.85 and net earnings totaled $117.9 million. For the six months ended July 29, 2006, earnings per share were $.73 and net earnings totaled $104.6 million. Sales for the first six months of 2007 increased 10% to $2.855 billion, with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 5% gain in the prior year.
     
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The strongest sales gains during the second quarter were in the Northwest and the Mid Atlantic, while Dresses and Home were the best-performing merchandise categories. As a percent of sales, lower general and administrative and occupancy expenses more than offset higher freight, distribution and store costs, resulting in a 20 basis point improvement in operating margin for the quarter."

Mr. Balmuth also noted, "Our balance sheet and cash flows remained healthy as we ended the first half of the year. We continued to return capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs. During the first six months of 2007, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $101 million. We are on track to complete during 2007 the remaining $99 million of our two-year $400 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors."
     
Mr. Balmuth continued,
"Looking ahead, we are slightly more cautious now in our second half outlook as a result of a combination of macro economic factors, recent results and projections from other retailers, and our own sales trend that slowed versus plan beginning in mid-July. Although we hope to perform better, in light of these issues, we believe it is prudent to manage our business with somewhat more conservative sales and margin assumptions for the balance of the year."
     
"We are now projecting same store sales growth of 1% to 3% for the third and fourth quarters, compared to our prior forecast of up 3% to 4% for both periods. Earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $.33 to $.37 for the 13 weeks ending November 3, 2007 and $.62 to $.68 for the 13 weeks ending February 2, 2008. Based on these projections, earnings per share for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2008 are forecast to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.90. This compares to our original earnings per share guidance of $1.85 to $1.95," Mr. Balmuth concluded.
     
Reported earnings per share for the fiscal 2006 third quarter, fourth quarter and fiscal year were $.31, $.66 and $1.70, respectively. In addition, last year's fourth quarter and fiscal year results included income equivalent to about $.07 per share related to the 53
rd
week in fiscal 2006.
