Exhibit 99.1
     
Pleasanton, California, March 19, 2008
- -- Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2008 of $.70, compared to $.66 for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2007. Net earnings for the 13 weeks ended February
2, 2008 totaled $94.5 million, compared to net earnings for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2007 of $93.1 million. Sales for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased 3% to $1.652 billion compared to $1.608 billion for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2007. Comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2008 rose 2% over the 13 weeks ended February 3, 2007.
For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, earnings per share were $1.90, compared to $1.70 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007. Net earnings for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 totaled $261.1 million, compared to $241.6 million for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007. Sales for the 2007 fiscal year increased 7% to $5.975 billion, with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 4% gain in the prior year.
     
Adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006, these results represent earnings per share increases of 19% and 17% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, respectively, on a 52-week basis. The 53
     
rd
week in fiscal 2006 added approximately $88 million in sales and earnings equivalent to approximately $.07 per share to both the fourth quarter and the year.

Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We realized solid earnings growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our ability to deliver compelling bargains to customers allowed us to successfully navigate the challenging retail climate, reflecting the resiliency of our off-price business model. The strongest regions for both the fourth quarter and the year were the Northwest and Texas, while Dresses, Home and Shoes were the best performing merchandise categories."
     
Mr. Balmuth continued, "For the 13-week fourth quarter of 2007, operating margin was 9.0% compared to 9.3% for the 14-week period in the prior year, as improvement in merchandise gross margin was offset mainly by increases in occupancy and store operating costs as a percent of sales. For the 2007 fiscal year, operating margin of 7.0% increased about 5 basis points over the prior year. Comparisons to last year are impacted by the 53 week, which we estimate benefited the 2006 fourth quarter and fiscal year operating margin by about 55 and 20 basis points, respectively."
rd
     
"Strong operating cash flows during 2007 continued to provide the resources to make capital investments in new store growth and infrastructure, and fund our ongoing stock repurchase and dividend programs. During the year, we invested $236 million in capital, which supported the addition of 67 net new Ross locations, 26 dd's DISCOUNTS
stores, distribution network projects and other various information technology and infrastructure investments," said Mr. Balmuth.
     
"We also repurchased a total of 6.9 million shares of common stock in 2007, for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million, completing our two-year program. In January 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year $600 million stock repurchase program for 2008 and 2009. This represents a 50% increase over the prior authorization, reflecting our ongoing confidence in the future growth prospects of the business. The Board also approved a 27% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.095 per share, our fourteenth consecutive annual dividend increase," Mr. Balmuth concluded.
     
The Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, March 19, 2008 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to communicate additional details concerning the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 results and management's outlook and plans for 2008.
