Tax Withholding.
               
(a)
In General.
At the time the Grant Notice is executed, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax (including any social insurance) withholding obligations of the Company, if any, which arise in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, obligations arising upon (a) the transfer of Shares to the Participant, (b) the lapsing of any restriction with respect to any Shares, (c) the filing of an election to recognize tax liability, or (d) the transfer by the Participant of any Shares. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver the Shares or to release any Shares from the Escrow established pursuant to Section 7 until the tax withholding obligations of the Company have been satisfied by the Participant.
               
(b)
Assignment of Sale Proceeds; Payment of Tax Withholding by Check.
Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company's Insider Trading Policy, the Company may permit the Participant to satisfy the Participating Company's tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for either (i) delivery by the Participant to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the Vested Shares, or (ii) payment by check.
The Participant shall deliver written notice of any such permitted election to the Company on a form specified by the Company for this purpose at least thirty (30) days (or such other period established by the Company) prior to the date on which the Company's tax withholding obligation arises (the
"
Withholding Date
"
). If the Participant elects payment by check, the Participant agrees to deliver a check for the full amount of the required tax withholding to the applicable Participating Company on or before the third business day following the Withholding Date. If the Participant elects payment by check but fails to make such payment as required by the preceding sentence, the Company is hereby authorized, at its discretion, to satisfy the tax withholding obligations through any means authorized by this Section 6.1, including by directing a sale for the account of the Participant of some or all of the Vested Shares from which the required taxes shall be withheld, by withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant or by withholding shares in accordance with Section 6.1(c).
               
(c)
Withholding in Shares.
The Company may require the Participant to satisfy all or any portion of the Company's tax withholding obligations by deducting a number of whole, Vested Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant or by the Participant's tender to the Company of a number of whole, Vested Shares or vested shares acquired otherwise than pursuant to this Agreement having, in any such case, a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.
6.2
          
Election Under Section 83(b) of the Code.
               
(a)
The Participant understands that Section 83 of the Code taxes as ordinary income the difference between the amount paid for the Shares, if anything, and the fair market value of the Shares as of the date on which the Shares are "substantially vested," within the meaning of Section 83. In this context, "substantially vested" means that the right of the Company to reacquire the Shares pursuant to the Company Reacquisition Right has lapsed. The Participant understands that he or she may elect to have his or her taxable income determined at the time he or she acquires the Shares rather than when and as the Company Reacquisition Right lapses by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service no later than thirty (30) days after the date of acquisition of the Shares. The Participant understands that failure to make a timely filing under Section 83(b) will result in his or her recognition of ordinary income, as the Company Reacquisition Right lapses, on the difference between the purchase price, if anything, and the fair market value of the Shares at the time such restrictions lapse. The Participant further understands, however, that if Shares with respect to which an election under Section 83(b) has been made are forfeited to the Company pursuant to its Company Reacquisition Right, such forfeiture will be treated as a sale on which there is realized a loss equal to the excess (if any) of the amount paid (if any) by the Participant for the forfeited Shares over the amount realized (if any) upon their forfeiture. If the Participant has paid nothing for the forfeited Shares and has received no payment upon their forfeiture, the Participant understands that he or she will be unable to recognize any loss on the forfeiture of the Shares even though the Participant incurred a tax liability by making an election under Section 83(b).
               
(b)
The Participant understands that he or she should consult with his or her tax advisor regarding the advisability of filing with the Internal Revenue Service an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, which must be filed no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the acquisition of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Failure to file an election under Section 83(b), if appropriate, may result in adverse tax consequences to the Participant. The Participant acknowledges that he or she has been advised to consult with a tax advisor regarding the tax consequences to the Participant of the acquisition of Shares hereunder. ANY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b) THE PARTICIPANT WISHES TO MAKE MUST BE FILED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THE PARTICIPANT ACQUIRES THE SHARES. THIS TIME PERIOD CANNOT BE EXTENDED. THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TIMELY FILING OF A SECTION 83(b) ELECTION IS THE PARTICIPANT'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, EVEN IF THE
PARTICIPANT REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVE TO FILE SUCH ELECTION ON HIS OR HER BEHALF.
(c)
               
The Participant will notify the Company in writing if the 
Participant files an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. The Company intends, in the event it does not receive from the Participant evidence of such filing, to claim a tax deduction for any amount which would otherwise be taxable to the Participant in the absence of such an election.

Appointment of Agent.

"
Agent
"
) to hold any and all Unvested Shares and to sell, assign and transfer to the Company any such Unvested Shares reacquired by the Company pursuant to the Company Reacquisition Right. The Participant understands that appointment of the Agent is a material inducement to make this Agreement and that such appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. The Agent shall not be personally liable for any act the Agent may do or omit to do hereunder as escrow agent, agent for the Company, or attorney in fact for the Participant while acting in good faith and in the exercise of the Agent's own good judgment, and any act done or omitted by the Agent pursuant to the advice of the Agent's own attorneys shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Agent may rely upon any letter, notice or other document executed by any signature purporting to be genuine and may resign at any time.
          
7.2
Establishment of Escrow
.
The Participant authorizes the Company to deposit the Unvested Shares with the Company's transfer agent to be held in book entry form, as provided in Section 3.3, and the Participant agrees to deliver to and deposit with the Agent each certificate, if any, evidencing the Shares and, if required by the Company, an Assignment Separate from Certificate with respect to such book entry shares and each such certificate duly endorsed (with date and number of Shares blank) in the form attached to this Agreement, to be held by the Agent under the terms and conditions of this Section 7 (the ).

The Company shall bear the expenses of the Escrow.
          
7.3
Delivery of Shares to Participant
.
The Escrow shall continue with respect to any Shares for so long as such Shares remain subject to the Company Reacquisition Right. Upon termination of the Company Reacquisition Right with respect to Shares, the Company shall so notify the Agent and direct the Agent to deliver such number of Shares to the Participant. As soon as practicable after receipt of such notice, the Agent shall cause to be delivered to the Participant the Shares specified by such notice, and the Escrow shall terminate with respect to such Shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares acquired pursuant to the Award prior to the Change in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares Shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of this Agreement except as otherwise provided herein.

For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company."

Unless the Company and the Participant otherwise agree in writing, the Accountants shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant within twenty (20) days of the date of the Event the amount of such acceleration of vesting, payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.

Tax Withholding.
               
(a)
In General.
At the time the Grant Notice is executed, or at any time thereafter as requested by a Participating Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax (including any social insurance) withholding obligations of the Participating Company, if any, which arise in connection with the Award, including, without limitation, obligations arising upon (a) the transfer of Shares to the Participant, (b) the lapsing of any restriction with respect to any Shares, (c) the filing of an election to recognize tax liability, or (d) the transfer by the Participant of any Shares. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver the Shares or to release any Shares from the Escrow established pursuant to Section 7 until the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company have been satisfied by the Participant.
               
(b)
Assignment of Sale Proceeds; Payment of Tax Withholding by Check.
Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company's Insider Trading Policy, the Company may permit the Participant to satisfy the Participating Company's tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for either (i) delivery by the Participant to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the Vested Shares, or (ii) payment by check. The Participant shall deliver written notice of any such permitted election to the Company on a form specified by the Company for this purpose at least thirty (30) days (or such other period established by the Company) prior to the date on which the Company's tax withholding obligation arises (the ). If the Participant elects payment by check, the Participant agrees to deliver a check for the full amount of the required tax withholding to the applicable Participating Company on or before the third business day following the Withholding Date. If the Participant elects payment by check but fails to make such payment as required by the preceding sentence, the Company is hereby authorized, at its discretion, to satisfy the tax withholding obligations through any means authorized by this Section 6.1, including by directing a sale for the account of the Participant of some or all of the Vested Shares from which the required taxes shall be withheld, by withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant or by withholding shares in accordance with Section 6.1(c).

(c)
               
Withholding in Shares.
The Company may require the
Participant to satisfy all or any portion of a Participating Company's tax withholding obligations by deducting a number of whole, Vested Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant or by the Participant's tender to the Company of a number of whole, Vested Shares or vested shares acquired otherwise than pursuant to this Agreement having, in any such case, a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.
          6.2
Election Under Section 83(b) of the Code.
               
(a)
The Participant understands that Section 83 of the Code taxes as ordinary income the difference between the amount paid for the Shares, if anything, and the fair market value of the Shares as of the date on which the Shares are "substantially vested," within the meaning of Section 83. In this context, "substantially vested" means that the right of the Company to reacquire the Shares pursuant to the Company Reacquisition Right has lapsed. The Participant understands that he or she may elect to have his or her taxable income determined at the time he or she acquires the Shares rather than when and as the Company Reacquisition Right lapses by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service no later than thirty (30) days after the date of acquisition of the Shares. The Participant understands that failure to make a timely filing under Section 83(b) will result in his or her recognition of ordinary income, as the Company Reacquisition Right lapses, on the difference between the purchase price, if anything, and the fair market value of the Shares at the time such restrictions lapse. The Participant further understands, however, that if Shares with respect to which an election under Section 83(b) has been made are forfeited to the Company pursuant to its Company Reacquisition Right, such forfeiture will be treated as a sale on which there is realized a loss equal to the excess (if any) of the amount paid (if any) by the Participant for the forfeited Shares over the amount realized (if any) upon their forfeiture. If the Participant has paid nothing for the forfeited Shares and has received no payment upon their forfeiture, the Participant understands that he or she will be unable to recognize any loss on the forfeiture of the Shares even though the Participant incurred a tax liability by making an election under Section 83(b).
               
(b)
The Participant understands that he or she should consult with his or her tax advisor regarding the advisability of filing with the Internal Revenue Service an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, which must be filed no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the acquisition of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Failure to file an election under Section 83(b), if appropriate, may result in adverse tax consequences to the Participant. The Participant acknowledges that he or she has been advised to consult with a tax advisor regarding the tax consequences to the Participant of the acquisition of Shares hereunder. ANY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b) THE PARTICIPANT WISHES TO MAKE MUST BE FILED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THE PARTICIPANT ACQUIRES THE SHARES. THIS TIME PERIOD CANNOT BE EXTENDED. THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TIMELY FILING OF A SECTION 83(b) ELECTION IS THE PARTICIPANT'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, EVEN IF THE
PARTICIPANT REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVE TO FILE SUCH ELECTION ON HIS OR HER BEHALF.
(c)
               
The Participant will notify the Company in writing if the
Participant files an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. The Company intends, in the event it does not receive from the Participant evidence of such filing, to claim a tax deduction for any amount which would otherwise be taxable to the Participant in the absence of such an election.

Appointment of Agent.

The Participant understands that appointment of the Agent is a material inducement to make this Agreement and that such appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. The Agent shall not be personally liable for any act the Agent may do or omit to do hereunder as escrow agent, agent for the Company, or attorney in fact for the Participant while acting in good faith and in the exercise of the Agent's own good judgment, and any act done or omitted by the Agent pursuant to the advice of the Agent's own attorneys shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Agent may rely upon any letter, notice or other document executed by any signature purporting to be genuine and may resign at any time.

7.2The Participant authorizes the Company to deposit the Unvested Shares with the Company's transfer agent to be held in book entry form, as provided in Section 3.3, and the Participant agrees to deliver to and deposit with the Agent each certificate, if any, evidencing the Shares and, if required by the Company, an Assignment Separate from Certificate with respect to such book entry shares and each such certificate duly endorsed (with date and number of Shares blank) in the form attached to this Agreement, to be held by the Agent under the terms and conditions of this Section 7 (the ). Upon the occurrence of an Ownership Change Event, a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company paid in shares of Stock or other property (other than regular, periodic dividends paid on Stock pursuant to the Company's dividend policy), or any other adjustment upon a change in the capital structure of the Company, as described in Section 4.4 of the Plan, in the character or amount of any outstanding stock of the corporation the stock of which is subject to the provisions of this Agreement, any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to which the Participant is entitled by reason of his or her ownership of the Shares that remain, following such Ownership Change Event, dividend, distribution or change described in Section 4.4 of the Plan, subject to the Company Reacquisition Right shall be immediately subject to the Escrow to the same extent as the Shares immediately before such event.

Tax Withholding.
     
          
(a)
In General.
At the time the Grant Notice is executed, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company, if any, which arise in connection with the Award or the issuance of Common Shares in settlement thereof. The Company shall have no obligation to process the settlement of the Award or to deliver Common Shares until the tax withholding obligations as described in this Section have been satisfied by the Participant.
               
(b)
Assignment of Sale Proceeds; Payment of Tax Withholding by Check.
Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company's Insider Trading Policy, the Company may permit the Participant to satisfy the Participating Company's tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for either (i) delivery by the Participant to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the Vested Shares, or (ii) payment by check. The Participant shall deliver written notice of any such permitted election to the Company on a form specified by the Company for this purpose at least thirty (30) days (or such other period established by the Company) prior to the date on which the Company's tax withholding obligation arises (the ). If the Participant elects payment by check, the Participant agrees to deliver a check for the full amount of the required tax withholding to the applicable Participating Company on or before the third business day following the Withholding Date.
"
Withholding Date
"
If the Participant elects payment by check but fails to make such payment as required by the preceding sentence, the Company is hereby authorized, at its discretion, to satisfy the tax withholding obligations through any means authorized by this Section 10.1, including by directing a sale for the account of the Participant of some or all of the Vested Shares from which the required taxes shall be withheld, by withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant or by withholding shares in accordance with Section 10.1(c).
               
(c)
Withholding in Common Shares.
The Company may require the Participant to satisfy its tax withholding obligations by deducting from the Common Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of the Award or from the Common Shares otherwise to be released from the Company Reacquisition Right a number of whole, Vested Common Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.
10.2
          
Election Under Section 83(b) of the Code.
               
(a)
The Participant understands that Section 83 of the Code taxes as ordinary income the difference between the amount paid for the Common Shares, if anything, and the fair market value of the Common Shares as of the date on which the Common Shares are "substantially vested," within the meaning of Section 83. In this context, "substantially vested" means that the right of the Company to reacquire the Common Shares pursuant to the Company Reacquisition Right has lapsed. The Participant understands that he or she may elect to have his or her taxable income determined at the time he or she acquires the Common Shares rather than when and as the Company Reacquisition Right lapses by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service no later than thirty (30) days after the date of acquisition of the Common Shares. The Participant understands that failure to make a timely filing under Section 83(b) will result in his or her recognition of ordinary income, as the Company Reacquisition Right lapses, on the difference between the purchase price, if anything, and the fair market value of the Common Shares at the time such restrictions lapse. The Participant further understands, however, that if Common Shares with respect to which an election under Section 83(b) has been made are forfeited to the Company pursuant to its Company Reacquisition Right, such forfeiture will be treated as a sale on which there is realized a loss equal to the excess (if any) of the amount paid (if any) by the Participant for the forfeited Common Shares over the amount realized (if any) upon their forfeiture. If the Participant has paid nothing for the forfeited Common Shares and has received no payment upon their forfeiture, the Participant understands that he or she will be unable to recognize any loss on the forfeiture of the Common Shares even though the Participant incurred a tax liability by making an election under Section 83(b).
               
(b)
The Participant understands that he or she should consult with his or her tax advisor regarding the advisability of filing with the Internal Revenue Service an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, which must be filed no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the acquisition of the Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement.
Failure to file an election under Section 83(b), if appropriate, may result in adverse tax consequences to the Participant. The Participant acknowledges that he or she has been advised to consult with a tax advisor regarding the tax consequences to the Participant of the acquisition of Common Shares hereunder. ANY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b) THE PARTICIPANT WISHES TO MAKE MUST BE FILED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THE PARTICIPANT ACQUIRES THE COMMON SHARES. THIS TIME PERIOD CANNOT BE EXTENDED. THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TIMELY FILING OF A SECTION 83(b) ELECTION IS THE PARTICIPANT'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, EVEN IF THE PARTICIPANT REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVE TO FILE SUCH ELECTION ON HIS OR HER BEHALF.
(c) The Participant will notify the Company in writing if the
               
Participant files an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. The Company intends, in the event it does not receive from the Participant evidence of such filing, to claim a tax deduction for any amount which would otherwise be taxable to the Participant in the absence of such an election.

The Award shall be settled in full in accordance with Section 6 immediately prior to the Change in Control, provided that the Participant's Service has not terminated prior to the Change in Control. In settlement of the Award, the Company shall issue to the Participant one (1) Vested Common Share for each Vested Performance Share determined in accordance with this Section.

In the event that any acceleration of vesting the Performance Shares or the Common Shares and any other payment or benefit received or to be received by the Participant would subject the Participant to any excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code due to the characterization of such acceleration of vesting, payment or benefit as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code, the amount of any acceleration of vesting called for by this Agreement shall not exceed the amount which produces the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.
               
(b)
Determination by Independent Accountants.
Upon the occurrence of any event that might reasonably be anticipated to result in an "excess parachute payment" to the Participant as described in Section 11.3(a) (an
"
Event
"
), the Company shall request a determination in writing by independent public accountants selected by the Company (the
"
Accountants

). Unless the Company and the Participant otherwise agree in writing, the Accountants shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant within twenty (20) days of the date of the Event the amount of such acceleration of vesting, payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant. For the purposes of such determination, the Accountants may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make their required determination. The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the Accountants may reasonably charge in connection with their services contemplated by this Section.

(a)
In General.
At the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for (including by means of a Cashless Exercise to the extent permitted by the Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax (including any social insurance) withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group have been satisfied by the Participant.
               
(b)
Withholding in Shares

The Company may require the Participant to satisfy all or any portion of a Participating Company's tax withholding obligations upon exercise of the Option by deducting from the shares of Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant upon such exercise a number of whole shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date of exercise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates.

The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. THE PARTICIPANT IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTICIPANT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.
