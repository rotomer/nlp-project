Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Both our January and fourth quarter sales were in line with our expectations. More importantly, merchandise gross margin for the fourth quarter was better than expected and up from last year. These results reflect the ongoing success of our core strategy of delivering compelling bargains, which have become increasingly important to today's value-focused consumer. Our aggressive inventory management has also been a key driver of improved profitability by promoting faster turns and lower markdowns."
     
"Based on our sales and margin trends, we now estimate earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 31, 2009 of $.75 to $.76, up from our previous guidance of $.73 to $.75 and $.70 for the 13 weeks ended February 2, 2008. For the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, earnings per share are estimated to increase 22% to 23% to $2.32 to $2.33, up from $1.90 in the prior year," said Mr. Balmuth.
Board Approves 16% Increase in Quarterly Dividend
     
The Company announced that its Board of Directors recently approved a 16% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $.11 per common share, payable on March 31, 2009 to stockholders of record as of February 20, 2009.
     
In commenting, Mr. Balmuth said, "Our solid financial position and anticipated future cash flows allow us to continue to enhance stockholder returns through both our dividend and share repurchase programs. The higher dividend announced today represents the fifteenth consecutive annual increase since our dividend program was initiated in 1994. In addition, I am pleased to report that during 2008 we repurchased a total of 9.3 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $300 million and expect to complete as planned the remaining $300 million repurchase authorization in 2009."
Fiscal 2009 Guidance
     
Looking ahead, Mr. Balmuth said, "Considering today's very difficult macro-economic and retail climate, we remain cautious in our outlook as we enter 2009. Our experience over the past year reflects the benefit of setting prudent targets when planning the business with the hope that we can do better."
