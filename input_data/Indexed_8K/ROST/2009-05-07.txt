Exhibit 99.1
     
Pleasanton, California, May 7, 2009 --
Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported that sales increased 11% to $534 million for the four weeks ended May 2, 2009, up from $480 million for the four weeks ended May 3, 2008. Comparable store sales for the month grew 6% over the prior year.
     
For the quarter ended May 2, 2009, sales totaled $1.692 billion, a 9% increase over the $1.556 billion in sales for the thirteen weeks ended May 3, 2008. Comparable store sales for the thirteen weeks ended May 2, 2009 grew 3% on top of a 3% increase in the prior year period.
     
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are very pleased with our sales gains for both April and the first quarter, especially considering the ongoing challenging economic and retail environment. We believe our solid performance throughout the quarter was driven by our continued ability to deliver compelling bargains to customers. Dresses, Children's and Shoes were the best performing merchandise categories for the month while the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic were the strongest regions."
     
Mr. Balmuth continued, "Our first quarter earnings are benefiting from above-plan sales, better-than-expected merchandise gross margin and tight expense control. As a result, earnings per share for the thirteen weeks ended May 2, 2009 are now estimated to be $.71 to $.72, up a strong 18% to 20% from the prior year's $.60 per share. This compares to our previous earnings per share range of $.68 to $.70."
