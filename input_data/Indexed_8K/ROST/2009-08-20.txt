Exhibit 99.1
     
Pleasanton, California, August 20, 2009 --
Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) today reported that earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2009 rose 52% to $.82, from $.54 for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2008. Net earnings for the second quarter of 2009 grew 45% to a record $103.4 million, from $71.3 million in the second quarter of 2008. Sales for the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2009 increased 8% to $1.769 billion, with comparable store sales up 3% on top of a strong 6% gain in the prior year.
     
For the six months ended August 1, 2009, earnings per share rose 37% to $1.55, from $1.13 for the six months ended August 2, 2008. Net earnings for the six months ended August 1, 2009 grew 29% to a record $194.8 million, compared to $150.8 million in the prior year period. Sales for the first six months of 2009 increased 8% to $3.460 billion, with comparable store sales up 3% on top of a 5% gain last year.
     
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are extremely pleased with our healthy sales and robust earnings gains in the second quarter and first six months, both of which were well ahead of plan. This outstanding performance is even more notable considering the ongoing difficult macro economic and retail climate. Our ability to deliver compelling bargains, while operating our business on much lower inventories, remains the primary driver of our strong results. The best performing merchandise categories during the second quarter and year to date periods were Dresses and Shoes, while the strongest regions were the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast."

Mr. Balmuth continued, "Second quarter operating margin grew about 260 basis points to 9.7%, driven by a 240 basis point improvement in gross margin and a 20 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative costs versus the prior year. The gross margin improvement was mainly due to substantial gains in merchandise margin and much lower freight costs as a percent of sales."
     
Mr. Balmuth also noted, "As we ended the first half of the year, our balance sheet and cash flows remained healthy. We continued to return capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs. During the first six months of fiscal 2009, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $154 million. We are on track to complete the remaining $146 million stock repurchase authorization by the end of fiscal 2009."
     
Looking ahead, Mr. Balmuth said, "We are optimistic about the important back-to-school and holiday periods for a number of reasons. We delivered exceptional sales and earnings growth for the first six months on top of strong results the prior year and are up against much easier comparisons in the second half. More importantly, we are well positioned in the value retailing sector and excited about our merchandise offerings and the availability of great product as we enter the fall season. As a result, we are now forecasting same store sales gains of 5% to 6% for both the third and fourth quarters, up from our previous guidance for a 2% to 3% increase."
     
Based on these updated sales targets, the Company is projecting third and fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the ranges of $.57 to $.63 and $.88 to $.94, respectively. These 2009 ranges compare to earnings per share of $.44 and $.76 in the 2008 third and fourth quarters, respectively. For the fiscal year ending January 30, 2010, the Company now projects earnings per share to increase 29% to 34% to $3.00 to $3.12, up from $2.33 in fiscal 2008.
     
The Company will provide additional details concerning its second quarter results and management's outlook for the third and fourth quarters on a conference call to be held Thursday, August 20, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time. Participants may listen to a real time audio webcast of the conference call by visiting the Company's website located at www.rossstores.com.
