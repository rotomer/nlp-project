Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
    
Pleasanton, California, November 18, 2010 --
Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2010 of $1.02, up from $.84 for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2009. These results reflect a 21% increase on top of an exceptional 91% gain in the third quarter of 2009. Net earnings for the third quarter ended October 30, 2010 grew 16% to a record $121.4 million, up from $105.1 million for the third quarter ended October 31, 2009. Fiscal 2010 third quarter sales increased 7% to $1.874 billion, with comparable store sales up 3% on top of a strong 8% gain in the prior year.
 
For the nine months ended October 30, 2010, earnings per share were $3.26, up from $2.39 for the nine months ended October 31, 2009. These results represent 36% growth on top of a robust 52% gain for the first nine months of 2009. Net earnings for the year-to-date period in 2010 grew 31% to a record $393.0 million, up from $299.9 million in the prior year period. Sales for the first nine months of 2010 increased 10% to $5.721 billion, with comparable store sales up 6% on top of a 5% gain last year.
    
 
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We delivered strong sales and earnings increases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 on top of outstanding gains in the prior year. This performance is especially noteworthy considering the ongoing uncertainty in the macro-economic and retail environment. Record operating margins in the third quarter and year-to-date periods were driven by our continued ability to deliver exciting bargains while operating our business on lower inventories, as well as much better-than-expected shortage results. The best performing merchandise categories during the third quarter were Dresses and Home. Geographic trends were relatively broad-based, with the strongest performance in Florida.

Mr. Balmuth continued, Third quarter 2010 operating margin grew to 10.5%, a 60 basis point increase on top of an exceptional 385 basis point gain in the third quarter of 2009. Gross margin rose 80 basis points, as higher merchandise gross margin, improved distribution costs and leverage on occupancy expenses were partially offset by higher incentive and freight costs as a percent of sales versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 20 basis points mainly due to higher incentive plan costs.
 
Mr. Balmuth also noted, As we ended the third quarter, our balance sheet and cash flows remained healthy, allowing us to continue to return capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs. During the first nine months of fiscal 2010, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $287 million. We remain on track to complete by the end of 2010 approximately $375 million of our current two-year $750 million stock repurchase authorization.
    
 
Looking ahead, Mr. Balmuth said, As we enter the fourth quarter, we are favorably positioned and our stores are stocked with fresh and exciting assortments of branded bargains. However, while we have outperformed our projections year-to-date, there are a number of reasons why we believe it is appropriate to maintain a cautious outlook. These include the likelihood of a very competitive holiday season, our tough prior year sales comparisons and this years difficult holiday calendar where the timing of Christmas Day means we have one less Saturday of business in our largest volume month of the year. As a result, although we hope to do better, we are maintaining our prior forecast for both sales and earnings in the fourth quarter.
    
 
For the 13 weeks ending January 29, 2011, the Company continues to project same store sales to be flat to down 1% versus a 10% increase in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share are still forecast to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. For the fiscal year ending January 29, 2011, we now project earnings per share to increase 25% to 26% to $4.41 to $4.46, up from $3.54 in fiscal 2009.
