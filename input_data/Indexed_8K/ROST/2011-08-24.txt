Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change of Fiscal Year.
 
On August 17, 2011, the Board of Directors (the Board) of Ross Stores, Inc. (the Company) amended the Companys Bylaws, by adopting the Ross Stores, Inc. Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws), which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1. The principal changes to the Bylaws, resulting from the amendments, are as described below.
 
The Company revised the information that a stockholder must disclose if it intends to present business or nominate director(s) before an annual stockholder meeting or to call a special stockholder meeting. The required information must include, among other things, information with respect to such stockholders interests in stock, contracts, derivative or synthetic instruments, and other arrangements and, in the case of nomination for director election, information regarding compensation arrangements between the stockholder making the nomination and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the nominee, on the other hand. The Bylaws also require that a nominee for election or reelection as a director submit a signed questionnaire with respect to his or her background and qualifications, as well as a representation and agreement that the nominee is not a party to any undisclosed voting commitment, any voting commitment that could interfere with such persons fiduciary duties under applicable law, or any undisclosed arrangement or understanding with any person other than the Company with respect to any direct or indirect compensation or indemnification in connection with service as a director, and that the nominee, if elected, will comply with all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance and other policies and guidelines of the Company. The Company may require a stockholder-proposed director nominee to furnish information relevant to determining whether such a nominee would be eligible to serve as an independent director of the Company.
 
In addition, per the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, the Company established the procedure for calling a special meeting of stockholders. In order for stockholders to call a special meeting, stockholders must request the Board to fix the place, date and time of such meeting and provide, among other things, the same information required for stockholder proposals at annual meetings. The Bylaws include exceptions designed to prevent duplicative and unnecessary meetings so that a special meeting will not be held under certain circumstances, including if: (i) the special meeting request is received during the period beginning 90 days prior to the anniversary of the prior annual meeting of stockholders and ending on the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders; (ii) an annual or special meeting of stockholders that included a substantially similar item of business was held not more than 90 days before the receipt of the special meeting request; or (iii) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held within 90 days of the date of the request and the business to be conducted at such meeting includes a substantially similar item. In addition, the Bylaws provide that special meeting requests will be considered together if they identify substantially the same purpose or purposes and substantially the same matter or matters proposed to be acted on at the meeting and if they have been dated and received by the Secretary of the Company within 60 days of the earliest dated request.
 
Any information that a stockholder provides to the Company in its notice or request must be updated and supplemented, if and as necessary, so that it is complete, true and correct as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and as of ten business days prior to the meeting. With respect to annual and special meetings of stockholders, the Bylaws provide that (i) the stockholder presenting proposed business or calling a special meeting must appear at the meeting to present such stockholders proposed business; (ii) the Board may postpone, reschedule or cancel a stockholder meeting, upon public notice prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting; and (iii) the Bylaws are the exclusive means for a stockholder to submit business (including nominations), other than proposals governed by Rule 14a-8 of the federal proxy rules (which provides its own procedural requirements).
 
With respect to directors and officers of the Company, the Bylaws require a majority of directors in order to call a special meeting of the Board. Additionally, the Company revised certain provisions regarding the indemnification rights of officers and directors. Specifically, the Bylaws provide that the Company must indemnify its officers and directors for the full amount of expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding to which an officer or director is a party due to his or her service to or at the request of the Company. The Bylaws state that officers and directors have contract rights in indemnification and advancement of expenses, which vest at the commencement of the officers or directors service to or at the request of the Company. Any subsequent amendments to the indemnification provisions of the Bylaws may not impair such rights with respect to an action or occurrence arising before the amendments were made. The Bylaws also set the procedures for indemnification and determination of entitlement to such indemnification.

In addition to the amendments described above, the Board approved and adopted various technical amendments (i) to reflect recent changes to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including with respect to the determination of the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of stockholders meetings and the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at stockholders meetings, (ii) to conform to the amendment to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, approved at the Companys 2011 annual stockholder meeting, adopting annual elections for directors, and (iii) to include grammatical, conforming and other non-substantive changes.
 
The foregoing description of amendments to the Ross Stores, Inc. Amended and Restated Bylaws is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Bylaws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Section 1.
Annual Meeting
. An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall each year fix, which date shall be within thirteen months subsequent to the later of the date of incorporation or the last annual meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.
    
Special Meetings
. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called only (1) by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption) or (2) by the holders of not less than ten percent (10%) of all of the shares entitled to cast votes at the meeting, and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix. Business transacted at special meetings shall be confined to the purpose or purposes stated in the Corporations notice of the meeting or in any supplemental notice delivered by the Corporation in accordance with Article I, Section 3 of these Bylaws.
 
In order for stockholders to call a special meeting (a stockholder-called special meeting), a written request to the Board of Directors to fix the place, date and time of a special meeting (a special meeting request) must be signed by the stockholders of the Corporation (or their duly authorized agents) holding ten percent (10%) of all of the shares entitled to cast votes at the meeting (the requisite percent) and must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation by registered mail, return receipt requested. The special meeting request shall (i) set forth the name and address, as they appear on the Corporations books, of each stockholder of the Corporation signing such request (or on whose behalf such request is signed) and the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf such request is made, (ii) comply with the requirements set forth in Article I, Section 7, Article I, Section 8, Article II, Section 11 and Article II, Section 12, as applicable, of these Bylaws, (iii) bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or duly authorized agent) signing the special meeting request, (iv) state the purchase date of each share of stock beneficially owned and intended to be counted in determining whether the shares of the Corporations stock held by the stockholders making such special meeting request satisfy the requisite percent, (v) include documentary evidence that the stockholders signing the special meeting request own the requisite percent as of the date of such special meeting request, provided, however, that if such stockholders are not the beneficial owners of the shares representing the requisite percent, then to be valid, the special meeting request shall also include documentary evidence that the beneficial owners on whose
    
behalf the special meeting request is made own the requisite percent as of the date of such special meeting request, (vi) provide a representation by each stockholder signing the special meeting request that (A) the stockholder, as of the date of such special meeting request, is, and through the date such stockholder-called special meeting is held, continuously will be, a holder of record of the number of shares of stock of the Corporation that is attributed to such stockholder in its special meeting request and such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the stockholder-called special meeting, and (B) the beneficial owner(s) on whose behalf the stockholder is making such special meeting request, if any, as of the date of such special meeting request, beneficially owns and, through the date such stockholder-called special meeting is held, continuously will beneficially own, the number of shares of stock of the Corporation that is attributed to such beneficial owner(s) in the stockholders special meeting request and such beneficial owner(s) intends to appear in person or by proxy at the stockholder-called special meeting, and (vi) include an agreement by each stockholder signing the special meeting request to notify the Corporation immediately in the case of any disposition before the date of the stockholder-called meeting of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or beneficially owned by such stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, and an acknowledgment that any such disposition shall be deemed a revocation of such special meeting request to the extent of such disposition, such that the number of shares disposed of shall not be included in determining whether the requisite percent has been reached.
 
 
    
In addition, the stockholders signing a special meeting request, the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the special meeting request is being made, and the proposed nominees, if any, shall promptly provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation. Each such stockholder, beneficial owner and proposed nominee, if any, shall further update and supplement the special meeting request received by the Corporation pursuant to this Article I, Section 2 so that the information, statements, representations and agreements provided or required to be provided in such special meeting request shall be complete, true and correct as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at such stockholder-called special meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the stockholder-called meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be received by the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation by registered mail, return receipt requested not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
 
In determining whether a special meeting of stockholders is being called by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate at least the requisite percent, multiple special meeting requests received by the Secretary will be considered together only if each such special meeting request (x) identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the stockholder-called special meeting and substantially the same matter or matters proposed to be acted on at the stockholder-called special meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) and (y) has been dated and received by the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated special meeting request. Any requesting stockholder may revoke its special meeting request at any time by written revocation received by the Secretary of the Corporation at
    
the principal executive offices of the Corporation; provided, however, that if following such revocation (or any deemed revocation pursuant to clause (vi) above), the unrevoked valid special meeting requests represent in the aggregate less than the requisite percent, there shall be no requirement to hold a special meeting. The first date on which unrevoked valid special meeting requests constituting not less than the requisite percent shall have been received by the Corporation is referred to herein as the request receipt date.
 
 
 
    
In the event of the receipt, in the manner provided in the previous paragraph, by the Corporation of the requisite special meeting request or requests and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation may engage nationally recognized independent inspectors for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the requests and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no special meeting shall be called until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the requests delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Article I, Section 2 represent at least the minimum number of shares held for the minimum amount of time to call such a stockholder-called special meeting. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Corporation or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
Business transacted at any stockholder-called special meeting shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the unrevoked valid special meeting request(s) signed by stockholders holding the requisite percent of the Corporations voting stock;
    
provided
,
however
, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matters to the stockholders at any stockholder-called special meeting.
 
Except as otherwise provided by law, in the case of a stockholder-called special meeting, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (i) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws, and (ii) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with these Bylaws or the stated business to be brought before the special meeting is a not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding anything in this Article I, Section 2 to the contrary, a stockholder-called special meeting shall not be held if (i) the special meeting request does not comply with this Article I, Section 2; (ii) the special meeting request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law; (iii) the receipt request date is during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (iv) an annual or special meeting of stockholders that included a substantially similar item of business (similar business) (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) was held not more than ninety (90) days before the receipt request date; (v) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held within ninety (90) days after the receipt request date, and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business to be conducted at such meeting includes
    
similar business; or (vi) the special meeting request was made in a manner that involved a violation of the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable law.

however
, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith to each stockholder entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as Directors at a meeting only if timely and proper notice of such stockholders intent to make such nomination or nominations (including the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Article II, Section 12 of these Bylaws), and timely updates and supplements thereof, have been given in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation in accordance with Article I, Section 7, Article I, Section 8 and Article II, Section 11 of these Bylaws.
 
In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, a stockholders notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such special meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such special meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a special meeting of stockholders, or the public announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.
    
 
 
 
    
In addition, to be considered timely, a stockholders notice shall further be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be complete, true and correct as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date, and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting, any adjournment or postponement thereof in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
 
In addition to the requirements set forth in Article I, Section 7 and Article I, Section 8 of these Bylaws, to be in proper form, each such notice shall set forth: (a) all information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; (b) the written consent of each nominee to be named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected; (c) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among the stockholder intending to make the nomination and the beneficial owner, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the stockholder intending to make the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the registrant for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant. In addition, each such notice shall also include completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Article II, Section 12 of these Bylaws. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholders understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
    
 
 
 
    
In the event that a person is validly designated as a nominee in accordance with this Article II, Section 11 and shall thereafter become unable or unwilling to stand for election to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors may designate a substitute nominee upon delivery, not fewer than five (5) days prior to the date of the meeting for the election of such nominee, of a written notice to the Secretary setting forth such information regarding such substitute nominee as would have been required to be delivered to the Secretary pursuant to this Article II, Section 11 had such substitute nominee been initially proposed as a nominee. Such notice shall include a signed consent to serve as a Director of the Corporation, if elected, of each such substitute nominee.

provided

Transfers of uncertificated shares of stock shall be made only upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered holder of the shares or by such holders attorney duly authorized in writing, and upon compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.
 
Section 3.
    
Record Date
. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days preceding the date of such meeting of stockholders. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given. If the Board of Directors fails to provide proper notice of a meeting of stockholders but notice is waived, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided
,
however
, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.
 
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or any other distribution or allotment of any rights, or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the business day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
    
 
 
 
    
Section 4.
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates
. In the event of the loss, theft or destruction of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place pursuant to such regulations as the Board of Directors may establish concerning proof of such loss, theft or destruction and concerning the giving of a satisfactory bond or bonds of indemnity.
 
Section 5.
    
Record Owners
. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise required by law.
 
Section 6.
    
Regulations
. The issue, transfer, conversion and registration of certificates of stock (or uncertificated stock) shall be governed by such other regulations as the Board of Directors may establish.

Notices
. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or required by law, all notices required to be given to any stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent shall be in writing and may in every instance be effectively given by hand delivery to the recipient thereof, by depositing such notice in the mails, postage paid, or by sending such notice by prepaid telegram or mailgram. Any such notice shall be addressed to such stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent at his or her last known address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. The time when such notice shall be deemed to be given shall be the time such notice is received by such stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent, or by any person accepting such notice on behalf of such person, if hand delivered, or dispatched, if delivered through the mails or by telegram or mailgram.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation hereunder shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law). Notice given by a form of electronic transmission in accordance with these Bylaws shall be deemed given at the times provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law.
    
 
Section 2.
    
Waivers
. A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder or director, officer, employee or agent entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be given to such stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
 
 
 
 
    
Section 1.

Resignations
. Any director or any officer, whether elected or appointed, may resign at any time by giving written notice of such resignation to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary, without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Corporation under any contract to which such officer is a party. No formal action shall be required of the Board of Directors or the stockholders to make any such resignation effective immediately.
 
Section 7.
    
Severability
. If any provision or provisions of these Bylaws shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Bylaws (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of these Bylaws containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of these Bylaws (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of these Bylaws containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
 
 
 
 
 
    
Section 1.
Right to Indemnification
. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (proceeding), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was, at any time during which this Bylaw is in effect (whether or not such person continues to serve in such capacity at the time any indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant hereto is sought or at the time any Proceeding relating thereto exists or is brought), a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be (and shall be deemed to have a contractual right to be) indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and amounts expended in seeking indemnification granted to such person under applicable law, these Bylaws or any agreement with the Corporation) incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;
provided
,
however
, that, except as provided in Article VIII, Section 2, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. All of the rights conferred in this Article VIII to indemnification, advancement of expenses and otherwise, shall be contract rights and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Corporation within twenty (20) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time. Such rights described in the preceding sentence shall vest at the commencement of such directors or officers service to or at the request of the Corporation and (x) any amendment or modification of this Article VIII that in any way diminishes or adversely affects any such rights shall be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any such rights with respect to any actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment or modification, or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission, and (y) all of such rights shall continue as to any such director or officer who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation or ceased to serve at the Corporations request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, as described herein, and shall inure to the benefit of such director or officers heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if the Delaware General Corporation Law then so requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise.
 
 
 
    
Section 2.
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under Article VIII, Section 1 is not paid in full by the Corporation within twenty (20) days (including with respect to the advancement of expenses) after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to this Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
Section 3.
    
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
. The rights conferred on any person in Article VIII, Section 1 and Article VIII, Section 2 shall not be exclusive of any other right which such persons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
 
Section 4.
    
Indemnification Contracts
. The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article VIII.
 
 
 
    
Section 5.
Insurance
. The Corporation shall maintain insurance to the extent reasonably available, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
Section 6.
    
Procedures for Indemnification
. To obtain indemnification under this Article VIII, a claimant shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Article VIII, Section 6, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimants entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the claimant, by independent legal counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by independent legal counsel, (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (ii) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (iii) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant or (iv) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by independent legal counsel at the request of the claimant, the independent legal counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors unless there shall have occurred within two (2) years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), in which case the independent legal counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
 
Section 7.
    
Effect of Amendment
. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article VIII by the stockholders and the directors of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.
 
Section 8.
    
Effect and Validity
. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Article VIII, Section 6 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2. The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2 that the procedures and presumptions of this Article VIII are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Article VIII.
