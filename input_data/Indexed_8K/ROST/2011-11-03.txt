Mr. Balmuth continued, We now estimate earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2011 will increase 23% to 24%, to $1.25 to $1.26, from last years $1.02 per share. The anticipated upside from our prior earnings per share guidance of $1.16 to $1.18 is due mainly to better-than-expected sales and margin performance in October. Earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending January 28, 2012 are now projected to be in the range of $5.54 to $5.61, up 20% to 21% over $4.63 in 2010.
