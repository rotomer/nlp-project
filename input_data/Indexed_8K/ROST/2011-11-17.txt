FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
    
Pleasanton, California, November 17, 2011
-- Ross Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2011 of $1.26, up from $1.02 for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2010. These results reflect a 24% increase on top of 21% and 91% gains in the third quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net earnings for the third quarter ended October 29, 2011 grew 19% to $144.0 million, up from $121.4 million for the third quarter ended October 30, 2010. Fiscal 2011 third quarter sales increased 9% to $2.046 billion, with comparable store sales up 5% over the prior year.
 
For the nine months ended October 29, 2011, earnings per share were $4.03, up from $3.26 for the nine months ended October 30, 2010. These results represent 24% growth on top of 36% and 52% gains for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net earnings for the year-to-date period in 2011 grew 18% to $465.2 million, up from $393.0 million in the prior year period. Sales for the first nine months of 2011 increased 9% to $6.210 billion, with comparable store sales up 5% on top of a 6% gain last year.
    
 
Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased with our above-plan sales and earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, especially considering this growth was achieved on top of exceptional increases in the prior two years. Our strong revenue gains continue to be driven mainly by our ability to deliver compelling bargains on a wide assortment of exciting name brand fashions for the family and the home to todays increasingly value-focused consumers. In addition, operating our business on lower in-store inventories is driving faster turns and lower markdowns, which continues to benefit profit margins.

Commenting on the Companys store growth, Mr. Balmuth said, As planned, in early October, we launched our expansion into the Midwest with the opening of 12 new Ross Dress for Less stores in the greater Chicago area. We are very excited about the long-term growth opportunities this market offers and are confident that Ross Dress for Less will become an attractive destination for customers there.
 
Mr. Balmuth continued, Operating margin in the third quarter grew about 45 basis points to 10.9%, driven primarily by a 40 basis point reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales decreased 5 basis points from the prior year, as higher merchandise gross margin, including better-than-expected shortage results, and leverage on buying and occupancy expenses more than offset an expected increase in packaway-related distribution costs as a percent of sales.
    
 
Two-for-One Stock Split
 
The Company announced that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split to be paid in the form of a 100% stock dividend on December 15, 2011 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2011. In addition, the Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.22 per share, or $.11 per share post-split, payable on December 30, 2011 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2011.
    
 
In commenting on these actions, Mr. Balmuth said, We have delivered outstanding financial performance over the past few years which has contributed to significant stock price appreciation over this period. Our decision to split the stock reflects the Board of Directors and managements ongoing confidence in the Companys future growth prospects and continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value.
    
 
Regarding the Companys ongoing stock repurchase program, Mr. Balmuth noted, During the first nine months of fiscal 2011, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $343 million. We remain on track to complete by the end of fiscal 2011 approximately $450 million of our current two-year $900 million stock repurchase authorization.

Fourth Quarter 2011 Guidance
 
    
Looking ahead, Mr. Balmuth said, As we enter the fourth quarter, we remain favorably positioned as a value retailer and our stores are stocked with terrific assortments of branded bargains. However, the ongoing uncertainty in the macro-economic environment as well as the possibility of an even more competitive than usual holiday season, keep us somewhat cautious in our outlook for the balance of the year. As a result, although we hope to do better, we are maintaining our prior fourth quarter forecast for both sales and earnings.
 
For the 13 weeks ending January 28, 2012, the Company continues to forecast same store sales to be up 2% to 3% on top of 4% and 10% gains for the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Earnings per share,
    
before the effect of the two-for-one stock split, are projected to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.59, up an estimated 12% to 16% on top of outstanding 18% and 53% increases in the prior two years.
 
The Company will provide additional details concerning its third quarter results, fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 guidance, and business outlook on a conference call to be held on Thursday, November 17, 2011 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
