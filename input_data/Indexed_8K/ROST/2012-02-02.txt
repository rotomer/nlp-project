Michael Balmuth, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Sales for both January and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were well ahead of our expectations as our wide assortments of compelling name-brand bargains continue to appeal to today's value-focused consumers. Juniors, Shoes and Children's were the strongest merchandise categories during the month, while Florida and the Mid-Atlantic were the top performing regions."

The Company announced that its Board of Directors recently approved a 27% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $.14 per common share, payable on March 30, 2012 to stockholders of record as of February 17, 2012.
    
In commenting, Mr. Balmuth said, "Our strong financial position and anticipated future cash flows allow us to continue to enhance stockholder returns through both our dividend and share repurchase programs. The higher dividend announced today represents the eighteenth consecutive annual increase since our dividend program was initiated in 1994. In addition, we are pleased to report that during 2011 we repurchased a total of 11.3 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $450 million. We expect to complete as planned the remaining $450 million repurchase authorization in fiscal year 2012."

"We are extremely pleased with both our sales and earnings growth in 2011, especially considering that they were achieved on top of exceptional increases over the past three years. We believe these outstanding multi-year gains continue to be driven by the strong execution of our resilient off-price business model. Additionally, our long-term record of delivering consistent growth in both healthy and more challenging economic climates gives us the confidence to continue to project respectable increases in both comparable store sales and earnings per share in 2012 and beyond."
