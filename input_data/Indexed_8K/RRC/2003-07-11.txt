EXHIBIT INDEX 4

EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE RANGE PROVIDES UPDATE FORT WORTH, TEXAS, JULY 11, 2003...RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) today provided updated information as to its debt status, hedging position, production and operations. During the second quarter, debt was reduced by $16.7 million, declining to $358.1 million at June 30. The debt reduction was the result of applying excess cash. At quarter-end, availability under the Company's parent credit facility was approximately $60 million. During the quarter, the Company added modestly to its oil and gas hedging position. New hedges added during the quarter included a combination of swaps and collars. Historically, the Company's hedging program was based on fixed price swaps. In the second quarter, the Company modified its hedging program to include collars whereby the Company will be assured a minimum floor price and will benefit from price increases up to a predetermined ceiling price. A summary of the Company's current hedge position is provided in the table below. Based on drilling results through June 30, the Company is on track to meet its production and reserve growth targets for 2003. As previously disclosed, the Company's second quarter production target was 155 to 156 Mmcfe per day. Based on preliminary information, the Company currently expects second quarter production to exceed 158 Mmcfe per day, compared to 154 Mmcfe per day in first quarter 2003 and 151 Mmcfe per day in second quarter 2002. Increasing production in 2003 is attributable to the Company's drilling program. In the second quarter, approximately $35 million of its $105 million capital budget was expended, funding the drilling of 103 (59.4 net) wells. Only 3 (2.0 net) of the wells proved unproductive. The Company will record dry hole expense of approximately $1.1 million for the quarter. In the first half of 2003, 156 (91.5 net) wells were successfully drilled. By June 30, 116 (71.8 net) of the wells had been placed on production. The remaining 40 (19.7 net) wells were in various stages of completion or waiting on pipeline connection. Drilling activity in the third quarter is expected to remain high as the Company currently has 11 rigs running. Wells materially impacting second quarter production include the Faulk #1, a discovery well located in South Louisiana, which is currently producing 16.1 (5.1 net) Mmcfe per day. In the Gulf of Mexico, West Cameron 45 #20 was returned to production in June after undergoing mechanical repairs and is currently producing 20.7 (4.1 net) Mmcfe per day, while the Ship Shoal 28 #40 discovery continues to produce 15.5 (3.0 net) Mmcfe per day. In the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma, five new wells are currently producing 8.9 (5.5 net) Mmcfe per day. Commenting on the announcement, John Pinkerton, Range's President, said, "In the first half of 2003, we achieved our two primary goals of increasing production while continuing to reduce debt with excess cash flow. The success of our drilling program included the exploitation of our development inventory as well as several exploratory discoveries. For the second half of 2003, we are focused on building upon the progress made in the first half by executing our drilling program, continuing to expand our prospect inventory and evaluating complementary acquisitions." 5
