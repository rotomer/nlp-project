EXHIBIT 99.2 NEWS RELEASE RANGE ANNOUNCES REDEMPTION OF 8-3/4% NOTES FORT WORTH, TEXAS, JULY 21, 2003 - RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) today announced that it had elected to redeem all of its outstanding 8-3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 on August 20, 2003. The notes are being called at 102.9167% of principal amount, plus accrued interest. Interest on the notes ceases to accrue on the redemption date. The aggregate redemption price, including the premium, will be approximately $70.8 million. The redemption was financed by the issuance of $100 million of 7-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013, which closed today. John H. Pinkerton, Range's President, stated, "We are pleased with the results of this redemption, which will effectively extend the maturity of our senior subordinated notes by six years, reduce ongoing interest expense and enhance our flexibility to further simplify our capital structure. With our stronger balance sheet and excess cash flow, we are better positioned to continue to execute our growth plan."
