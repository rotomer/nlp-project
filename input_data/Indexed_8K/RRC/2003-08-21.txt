EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS RELEASE RANGE COMPLETES REDEMPTION OF 8-3/4% NOTES FORT WORTH, TEXAS, AUGUST 20, 2003 - RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) today announced that it had completed the previously announced redemption of all of its outstanding 8-3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007. The redemption was financed by the issuance of $100 million of 7-3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 that was completed July 21, 2003. The total redemption price, including the call premium was $70.8 million. As a result of the redemption, the Company will recognize debt extinguishment expense totaling $2.4 million ($1.5 million net of tax) in the quarter ended September 30, 2003. This includes the premium of $2.0 million and a non-cash charge of $0.4 million representing the write-off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the 8-3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes. The excess proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's bank credit facility. Currently, the Company has approximately $85 million of availability under the credit facility. John H. Pinkerton, Range's President, stated, "The financing extends the maturity of our senior subordinated notes six years, reduces ongoing interest expense and provides additional financial flexibility. With our stronger balance sheet and cash flow, we are better positioned to continue to execute our growth plan."

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
