today reported third quarter results. Revenues in the quarter totaled $76.2 million, a 48% increase from the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital rose 20% to $35.6 million as pretax income jumped 168% to $25.8 million. Net income totaled $16.7 million ($0.29 per share fully diluted), a 71% rise. During the period, drilling success led to rising production, debt fell to less than 50% of capitalization and the senior management team was completed.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS, NOVEMBER 4, 2003...RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC)
The quarter's financial results were significantly impacted by certain items, including an $18.6 million gain on debt retirement and a $2.4 million expense on the redemption of subordinated notes. Excluding such items, pretax income would have been $9.2 million, a 15% increase from the prior-year period. Net income would have been $6.0 million. In 2003, taxes are being recorded at a 35% rate due to increased profitability. In the prior year, tax benefits were recorded. (See table below for calculation of these non-GAAP measures.)
Production in the quarter rose 5.2% to an average of 159 Mmcfe per day, comprised of 120 Mmcf and 6,526 barrels. The growth was achieved through the ongoing exploitation of an extensive development drilling inventory and several meaningful discoveries. Wellhead prices, after hedging, averaged $3.81 per mcfe, a 10% increase. Gas prices rose 9% to $3.81 per mcf, as oil prices increased 8% to $23.76 per barrel. Hedging decreased realized prices by $0.94 per mcf and $3.66 a barrel.
Expenses in the period increased at a slower rate than revenues. Direct operating costs fell on a per unit basis to $0.55 per Mcfe from $0.61 in the prior period but rose $604,000 due to higher production taxes. Exploration expense increased $1.8 million principally due to additional seismic costs. General and administrative expenses rose $266,000 as a result of higher personnel costs and professional fees. Interest expense fell $516,000 due to lower outstanding debt. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense increased $978,000 due to higher volumes. Accretion expense on asset retirement obligations totaled $1.2 million for the quarter, reflecting the impact of an accounting rule imposed in 2003. IPF expenses decreased $230,000 due to lower interest and administrative expenses. The provision for income taxes increased to $9.0 million, reflecting a full 35% rate and sharply higher pretax income. While increasing profitability now requires a full tax provision, no material cash taxes are expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
During the third quarter, several material financing transactions were completed. In July, $100 million of ten year 7-3/8% senior subordinated notes were issued. Part of the proceeds was used to retire the remaining $68.8 million of 8-3/4% senior subordinated notes and to repurchase $9.9 million of other debt at a discount. The remainder was used to reduce bank debt. A one-time charge of $2.4 million was incurred in retiring the 8-3/4% notes. In September, $79.5 million of Trust Preferred was extinguished in exchange for $50 million of 5.9% convertible perpetual preferred stock and $10.2 million of cash. The Company recognized a gain on the retirement of $18.6 million ($12.1 million after-tax) in the third quarter. These transactions reduced ongoing financing cost by $4 million per year and extended the average maturity of the Company's debt. At September 30, debt totaled $280 million, down $88 million since year-end. In the same period, stockholders' equity increased $77 million due to the issuance of the $50 million of 5.9% preferred stock and $30.8 million of net income offset by $3.8 million of other items. At September 30, the Company's debt to capitalization ratio had been reduced to 49.7%.
In the third quarter, the Company spent $28 million out of its $105 million 2003 capital budget. The expenditures funded the drilling of 105 (53.2 net) wells of which six (3.9 net) proved unproductive. During the first nine months of the year, 265 (147.8 net) wells were drilled at a cost of $77 million of which eleven (7.9 net) were dry. By September 30, 219 (121.0 net) of these wells had been placed on production, with the remaining wells being in various stages of completion or waiting on pipeline connection. During the quarter, $1.6 million was also spent on acquisitions, bringing the total for the
 
first three quarters to $8.0 million. Drilling activity in the fourth quarter will remain high, with 12 rigs running currently.
Drilling drove the 5.2% increase in production during the period. Two Canyon Sand wells in Sterling and Sutton counties were drilled to 6,700 feet and one Wolfcamp well in Glasscock County was drilled to 8,400 feet. These three wells are currently producing a total of 5.9 (2.8 net) Mmcfe a day. A previously drilled well was recompleted in the upper Strawn for 2.1 (1.6 net) Mmcfe per day. In the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma, three wells were drilled to the Morrow formation at approximately 9,000 feet. One was turned to production during the quarter at 1.5 (1.0 net) Mmcfe a day. Since September 30, the two remaining wells were turned on at a combined 4.2 (2.3 net) Mmcfe a day. Casing has been set to test two additional Panhandle wells, which should be completed shortly. In South Louisiana, the Villejoin #1 was completed as a successful offset to a discovery drilled late last year and is currently producing 12.2 (3.9 net) Mmcfe per day. In Appalachia, 76 (59.0 net) wells were successfully drilled in the third quarter.
Commenting, John H. Pinkerton, the Company's President, noted, "The quarter was highlighted by three major events: the continuing success of our drilling program and rising production, the decline of our debt to capitalization to below 50% and the appointment of Roger Manny as Chief Financial Officer to complete our new management team. With a strong balance sheet, a revitalized management and a lower cost structure, we have significantly enhanced our ability to profitably grow through the drill bit while pursuing complementary acquisitions."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
Third quarter 2003 earnings include derivative ineffective hedging gains of $1.1 million, non-cash deferred compensation expense of $898,000, amortization of interest rate swap gains of $157,000, a $18.6 million gain on retirement of securities and a call premium and amortization write off of $2.4 million. Adjusting for the after-tax effect of these items, the Company's earnings would have been $6.0 million in the third quarter 2003 or $0.11 per share ($0.10 per diluted share). If similar items were excluded, third quarter 2002 earnings would have been $8.2 million or $0.15 per share ($0.15 per diluted share). (See reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings in the table below.) The Company believes results excluding these items are more comparable to estimates provided by security analysts and, therefore, are useful in evaluating operational trends of the Company and its performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. In addition, with the adoption effective January 1, 2003 of the new accounting rule regarding asset retirement obligations, the Company provided $1.2 million of accretion expense in the third quarter or $764,000 after tax ($0.01 per share) which was not similarly provided in the prior period.
Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital represents net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital adjusted for certain non-cash compensation items and the cash call premium and amortization write off of $2.4 million. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is widely accepted by the investment community as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is also useful because it is
 
widely used by professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. A table is included which reconciles net cash provided by operations to Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital as used in this release. On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods.
