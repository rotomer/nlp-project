effective, as described in the preceding sentence), and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time.

(d) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under this Section 1.4, (i) liquid hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run or, if there are no such storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are transported from the field, and (ii) gaseous hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are transported. Sellers shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not available. Sellers shall provide to Purchaser, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, evidence of all meter readings and all gauging and strapping procedures conducted on or about the Effective Time in connection with the Assets, together with all data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof. Taxes that are included in Property Costs, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling before and the number of days in the applicable period falling at or after the Effective Time, except that production, severance and similar Taxes measured by the quantity of or the value of production shall be prorated based on the number of units or value of production actually produced and sold, as applicable, before, and at or after, the Effective Time. In each case, Purchaser shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period at and after the Effective Time and Sellers shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period before the Effective Time.

SECTION 1.5 DELIVERY AND MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS. (a) Sellers, at Purchaser's cost, shall deliver to Purchaser (i) upon Closing, those well files, land files and any other files/records which are included in the Records and are necessary to physically operate those Properties for which Purchaser has been elected operator, and (ii) upon the termination of the Transition Agreement, all other Records; provided, however, that Sellers, at Sellers' cost, may retain copies of any such Records. (b) Purchaser, for a period of five (5) years following Closing, will (i) retain the Records, (ii) provide each Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, employees and representatives with access to the Records during normal business hours for review and copying at such Seller's expense and (iii) provide each Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, employees and representatives with access, during normal business hours, to materials received or produced after Closing relating to any claim for indemnification made under Section 10.1 of this Agreement (excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client communications with respect to any such claim being brought by Purchaser under this Agreement) for review and copying at such Seller's expense. ARTICLE 2 PURCHASE PRICE SECTION 2.1 PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price for the Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall be $89,500,000. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among Sellers as follows:
W&B $89,500,000 Canyon $ 0 Intercon $ 0
The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in Section 2.2. SECTION 2.2 ADJUSTMENTS TO PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price for the Assets shall be adjusted as follows with all such amounts being determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied: (a) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received by any Seller from and after the Effective Time through the Closing Date (with the period from and after the Effective Time through the Closing Date referred to as the "Adjustment Period"): (i) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any (A) royalties, overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of production, (B) gathering, processing and transportation costs not included in "Property Costs" and (C) production, severance, sales or excise Taxes not reimbursed to a Seller by the purchaser of production) produced from or attributable to the Properties during the EXECUTION COPY -7-
Adjustment Period, and (ii) other proceeds received with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period (provided that for purposes of this Section 2.2(a), no adjustment shall be made for funds received by any Seller for the account of third Persons pursuant to Section 1.4(e)); (b) Reduced in accordance with Section 3.5, by amounts equal to (i) the Allocated Values of those Properties with respect to which preferential purchase rights have been exercised, (ii) the Allocated Values of those Properties which have been excluded from Closing because the time for exercise of preferential purchase rights has not yet expired and (iii) the Allocated Values of those Properties which have been excluded from Closing because a consent requirement remains unsatisfied; (c) Reduced in accordance with Section 3.6, by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from Closing pursuant to that Section; (d) Reduced as a result of Title Defects by the amounts determined under Section 3.4(d) and increased as a result of Title Benefits by the amounts determined under Section 3.4(e); (e) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets on or after the Effective Time and paid by any Seller, except any Property Costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds in Section 2.2(a)(i); and (f) Increased by the amount of all prepaid expenses (including pre-paid rentals and cash calls and advances to third Person operators for expenses not yet incurred) paid by Sellers with respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets after the Effective Time and not yet applied as of the Closing Date. The adjustment described in Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's entitlement under Sections 1.2(j) and 1.4 to Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Leases, Units and Wells during the Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any production or income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has been made. Similarly, the adjustment described in Section 2.2(e) shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's obligation under Section 1.4 to pay Property Costs and other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are incurred during the Adjustment Period, and Purchaser shall not be separately obligated to pay for any Property Costs or other such costs with respect to which an adjustment has been made. Each adjustment to the Purchase Price described in Sections 2.2(a) through (f) shall be allocated to the portion of the Purchase Price payable to the Seller of the Asset or Assets affected by the adjustment, as further described in Section 2.3. The Purchase Price, adjusted as set forth in (a) through (f), shall be the "Adjusted Purchase Price." If the Closing occurs, the Deposit (as hereinafter defined), together with any interest earned thereon, shall be credited to the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser at Closing. EXECUTION COPY -8-
SECTION 2.3 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. Schedule 2.3 sets forth the agreed allocation of the unadjusted Purchase Price among each of the Assets, which has been made in compliance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury regulations thereunder. The "Allocated Value" for any Asset equals the portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on Schedule 2.3, increased or decreased as described in this Section. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 2.2(a) through (f) shall be applied to the amounts set forth in Schedule 2.3 for the particular affected Assets. Sellers have accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values. Sellers and Purchaser agree (i) that the Allocated Values shall be used by Sellers and Purchaser as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax returns, including without limitation Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (ii) that neither they nor their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with the Allocated Values in notices to government authorities, in audit or other proceedings with respect to Taxes, in notices to preferential purchaser right holders, or in other documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. EXECUTION COPY -9-
SECTION 2.4 DEPOSIT. Within 2 Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall have deposited the amount of $5,000,000 (the "Deposit") in an escrow account to be held by JPMorganChase Bank (the "Escrow Agent") in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to an escrow agreement (the "Deposit Escrow Agreement") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (subject to the Escrow Agent's approval). In the event (a) this Agreement is terminated by any Party pursuant to Sections 9.1(i) or 9.1(ii), (b) Sellers wrongfully terminate this Agreement, (c) this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(iii) and Sellers have negligently or willfully failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of their respective covenants and agreements hereunder, or (d) this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(iii) and as of the Outside Date (as hereinafter defined) all of Purchaser's conditions to Closing pursuant to Section 7.2 have not been met or waived in writing, Purchaser shall be entitled to a disbursement of the Deposit (plus any interest accrued thereon) from the escrow account by the Escrow Agent. In the event (x) Purchaser wrongfully terminates this Agreement, (y) this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(iii) and Purchaser has negligently or willfully failed to perform or observe in any material respect its covenants and agreements hereunder, or (z) this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(iii) and as of the Outside Date all of Purchaser's conditions to Closing pursuant to Section 7.2 have either been met or waived in writing, Sellers shall be entitled to a disbursement of the Deposit (plus any interest accrued thereon) from the escrow account by the Escrow Agent as liquidated damages hereunder, which damages, in such event, the Parties anticipate shall approximate the amount of actual damages incurred by Sellers given the fact that Sellers' actual damages so incurred would be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately. If the Closing occurs, the Parties shall provide joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit (plus any interest earned thereon) to Sellers as a credit to the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser at Closing. ARTICLE 3 TITLE MATTERS SECTION 3.1 SELLER'S TITLE. (a) Each Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that such Seller's title to the Wells shown on Exhibit A-1 is Defensible Title as defined in Section 3.2. (b) Except for the Leases, each Seller represents and warrants that it has good and indefeasible title to the other real property (the "Ancillary Real Property") of such Seller that is included in the Assets, and such real property is, or shall be as of the Closing Date, free and clear of all liens except for Permitted Encumbrances. Additionally, Canyon represents and warrants that it has all property rights necessary to operate the Gathering Systems. (c) The conveyance of the Assets to be delivered by Sellers to Purchaser shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Conveyance") and contain a special warranty of title by, through and under each Seller to such Seller's interest in the Assets and in the Wells shown as owned by such Seller on Exhibit A-1, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, but shall otherwise be without warranty of title, express, implied or statutory, except that such conveyances shall transfer to Purchaser all rights or actions on EXECUTION COPY -10-
title warranties given or made by Sellers' predecessors (other than Affiliates of any Seller), to the extent Sellers may legally transfer such rights. (d) Except as provided in Section 7.2(e), this Article 3 shall provide Purchaser's exclusive remedy in respect of Title Defects reported in accordance with this Article 3, and Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under Sellers' special warranty of title in the Conveyance against any Title Defect reported under this Article 3. SECTION 3.2 DEFINITION OF DEFENSIBLE TITLE. As used in this Agreement, the term "Defensible Title" means that title of a Seller to a Well which, subject to Permitted Encumbrances: (a) Entitles such Seller to receive throughout the duration of the productive life of such Well (after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests or other similar burdens on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons), not less than the "net revenue interest" share shown in Exhibit A-1 of all Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from such Well, except decreases in connection with those operations in which such Seller may be a nonconsenting co-owner from and after the date hereof, decreases resulting from the reversion of interests to co-owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners elected not to consent from and after the date hereof, decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment of pools or units from and after the date hereof, and decreases required to allow co-owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries; (b) Obligates such Seller to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Well not greater than the "working interest" shown in Exhibit A-1 without increase throughout the productive life of such Well, except as stated in Exhibit A-1 and except increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to defaulting co-owners under applicable operating agreements or applicable Law and increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in such Seller's net revenue interest attributable to such Well; and (c) Is free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. As used in this Agreement, the term "Encumbrance" means any lien, charge or encumbrance, and the term "Title Defect" means any defect, discrepancy or Encumbrance affecting a Seller's title to a Well or to any part of the Ancillary Real Property, that causes a breach of a Seller's representation and warranty in Section 3.1. As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" shall mean any right, circumstance or condition that operates to increase the net revenue interest of a Seller in any Well above that shown on Exhibit A-1, without causing a greater than proportionate increase in such Seller's working interest above that shown in Exhibit A-1. SECTION 3.3 DEFINITION OF PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES. As used herein, the term "Permitted Encumbrances" means any or all of the following: EXECUTION COPY -11-
(a) lessors' royalties and any overriding royalties, reversionary interests and other burdens on production to the extent that they do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce any net revenue interest of a Seller below that shown in Exhibit A-1 or increase any working interest of a Seller above that shown in Exhibit A-1 without a proportionate increase in the corresponding net revenue interest; (b) all Contracts, to the extent that they do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce any net revenue interest of a Seller below that shown in Exhibit A-1 or increase any working interest of a Seller above that shown in Exhibit A-1 without a proportionate increase in the corresponding net revenue interest or otherwise materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with the use or ownership of the Assets subject thereto or affected thereby (as currently owned or used); (c) subject to compliance with Section 3.5, preferential rights to purchase the Assets; (d) subject to compliance with Section 3.5, third-party consent requirements and similar restrictions with respect to the Assets; (e) liens for current Taxes or assessments not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, being contested in good faith by appropriate actions and described on Schedule 4.7; (f) materialman's, mechanic's, repairman's, employee's, contractor's, operator's and other similar liens or charges arising in the ordinary course of business for amounts not yet delinquent (including any amounts being withheld as provided by Law), or if delinquent, being contested in good faith by appropriate actions and described on Schedule 3.3(f); (g) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other actions by Governmental Bodies in connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or interests therein customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance; (h) rights of reassignment arising upon final intention to abandon or release the Assets, or any of them; (i) easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other rights in respect of surface operations not interfering with operations as presently conducted; (j) calls on production under existing Contracts; (k) gas balancing and other production balancing obligations, and obligations to balance or furnish make-up Hydrocarbons under Hydrocarbon sales, gathering, processing or transportation contracts; (l) all rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Body to control or regulate any of the Assets in any manner and all obligations and duties under all EXECUTION COPY -12-

SECTION 3.4 NOTICE OF TITLE DEFECTS; DEFECT ADJUSTMENTS. (a) To assert a claim arising out of a breach of Section 3.1 prior to Closing, Purchaser shall deliver a claim notice to Sellers as soon as practicable after having actual Knowledge of a Title Defect but in any case on or before a date which is ten (10) days prior to the scheduled Closing Date under Section 8.1(a) (the "Title Claim Date"), except as otherwise provided under Sections 3.5 or 3.6. Such notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a specific description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Wells and/or Ancillary Real Property affected, (iii) the Allocated Values of the Wells subject to the alleged Title Defect(s) or associated with the Ancillary Real Property that is subject to the alleged Title Defect, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Sellers) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s) and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Values of those Wells are reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations upon which Purchaser's belief is based. Except as provided for in Section 7.2(e), Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all breaches of Section 3.1 of which Sellers have not been given notice on or before the Title Claim Date. (b) Should Purchaser have actual Knowledge of any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim Date, Purchaser shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the Title Claim Date, deliver to Sellers a notice including (i) a specific description of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Wells affected, (iii) the Allocated Values of the Wells subject to such Title Benefit and (iv) the amount by which the Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of those Wells is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations upon which Purchaser's belief is based. Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser a similar notice on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Sellers. Sellers shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which neither Party has given notice on or before the Title EXECUTION COPY -13-
Claim Date, except to the extent Purchaser has failed to give a notice which it was obligated to give under this Section 3.4(b). (c) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at their sole cost, to cure or remove on or before the Closing Date any Title Defects of which they have been advised by Purchaser. If Sellers have commenced to cure a Title Defect prior to the Closing Date and are pursuing that cure diligently, Sellers may, by notice to Purchaser prior to Closing, elect to continuing attempting to cure such Title Defect for up to ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. (d) Sellers' interest in each Well and/or Ancillary Real Property affected by Title Defects reported under Section 3.4(a) and not cured prior to the Closing Date shall be assigned at Closing subject to all such uncured Title Defects. If Sellers have not provided notice under Section 3.4(c) of their election to continue attempting to cure a Title Defect after the Closing Date, then the amount of such Title Defect (the "Title Defect Amount") shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.4(g). To the extent Sellers have elected to cure a Title Defect post-Closing pursuant to Section 3.4(c) or Purchaser and Sellers cannot agree on the existence of, or Title Defect Amounts for, any alleged Title Defect, the average of Purchaser's and Sellers' Title Defect Amount for each such Title Defect, which shall be determined in good faith by each Party, shall be used for purposes of determining amounts to be escrowed, if any, as provided for below. In the event the sum of all Title Defect Amounts, including any amounts determined as provided above, exceeds the Basket at Closing, then (i) the full amount of the undisputed Title Defect Amounts will be used to reduce the Purchase Price at Closing and (ii) the average of those Title Defect Amounts, as calculated in the preceding sentence, attributable to uncured Title Defects, disputed Title Defects and/or disputed Title Defect Amounts shall be deposited at Closing in an escrow account to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to an escrow agreement (the "Title Escrow Agreement") to be mutually agreed to by the Parties and the Escrow Agent. Purchaser and Sellers shall each be responsible for one-half of the fees and expenses, if any, of the Escrow Agent. If any of the Title Defects have been cured or otherwise resolved by the Parties by the expiration of the time period provided for in Section 3.4(c) to cure such Title Defects, then the Parties shall provide joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Title Defect Amounts held in escrow attributable to such cured or resolved Title Defects to the applicable Seller. If any of the Title Defects have not been cured or otherwise resolved by the Parties by the expiration of the time period provided for in Section 3.4(c) to cure such Title Defects, then the Parties shall provide joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to release any undisputed Title Defect Amounts held in escrow attributable to any uncured and undisputed Title Defects to Purchaser and all remaining disputed Title Defect Amounts and/or Title Defects shall be submitted to arbitration by the Parties as provided for in Section 3.4(i), which amounts will then be distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the final decision of the Title Arbitrator thereunder, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4(d), no reduction shall be made in the Purchase Price with respect to any Title Defect for which the Seller of the affected Wells and/or Ancillary Real Property, if agreed to in writing by Purchaser regarding the same, shall execute and deliver to Purchaser a written indemnity agreement, EXECUTION COPY -14-
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, under which such Seller agrees to fully, unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its successors and assigns from any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from such Title Defect. (e) With respect to each Well affected by Title Benefits reported under Section 3.4(b) (or of which Purchaser had Knowledge on or prior to the Title Claim Date and should have reported under Section 3.4(b)), the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Well caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(h); provided, that, the Purchase Price shall only be increased for any for Title Benefit if the Title Benefit Amount with respect thereto exceeds $100,000. (f) Except as provided in Section 7.2(e), Section 3.4(d) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to any Seller's breach of its warranty and representation in Section 3.1. (g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined as follows: (i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount; (ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the affected Well and/or Ancillary Real Property; (iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue interest for any Well and (B) the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit A-1, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Well multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest decrease and the denominator of which is the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit A-1, provided that if the Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Well throughout its entire productive term, the Title Defect Amount determined under this Section 3.4(g)(iii) shall be reduced accordingly; (iv) if the Title Defect represents a defect, discrepancy or Encumbrance to a Well and/or Ancillary Real Property of a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Well and/or with respect to any Ancillary Real Property, the Well associated therewith so affected, the portion of Sellers' interest in the Well and/or Ancillary Real Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Well, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; EXECUTION COPY -15-
(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (A) an individual claim for a Title Defect affecting a Well and/or Ancillary Real Property for which a claim notice is given on or prior to the Title Claim Date shall only be subject to adjustment under this Article 3 (except for adjustments required by Section 3.5 or Section 3.6) if the Title Defect Amount with respect thereto exceeds $100,000, net of any Title Benefit Amount (of any amount) with respect to such Well, and then adjustment shall be for all of such amounts (above and below such $100,000 amount), subject to the provisions regarding the Basket below, (B) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any given Well and/or Ancillary Real Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Well or with respect to any Ancillary Real Property, the Well associated therewith, (C) except for adjustments required by Section 3.5 or Section 3.6, there shall be no Purchase Price adjustment or escrowed amounts for Title Defects unless and until the aggregate Title Defect Amounts for all Wells and/or Ancillary Real Property for which claim notices were timely delivered exceeds the Basket, net of any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.4(e) (at which time all adjustments for such Title Defects shall be made for all such Title Defect Amounts), and (D) the Title Defect Amount for any alleged Title Defect as to Ancillary Real Property claimed as a result of a breach of Section 3.1(b) shall be computed on the basis of the Allocated Value attributable to the Well or Wells affected by such alleged Title Defect; (vi) for purposes of Closing, if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the lesser of (A) the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect or (B) the share of such curative work cost and expense which is allocated to such Well pursuant to subsection (vii) below; and (vii) the Title Defect Amount shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses (A) included in another Title Defect Amount hereunder, (B) included in a casualty loss under Section 3.6, or (C) for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price. To the extent that the cost to cure any Title Defect will result in the curing of all or a part of one or more other Title Defects, such cost of cure shall be allocated for purposes of Section 3.4(g)(vi) among the Wells so affected on a fair and reasonable basis. (h) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the Allocated Value of the affected Well multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest increase and the denominator of which is the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit A-1, provided that if the Title Benefit is not effective or does not affect a Well throughout the entire life of the Well, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this Section 3.4(h) shall be reduced accordingly. (i) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts by three (3) days prior to the scheduled Closing Date under EXECUTION COPY -16-
Section 8.1(a). At the end of the time period specified in Section 3.4(c), all Title Defects, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts still in dispute shall be submitted by the Parties to a title attorney with at least 10 years' experience in oil and gas titles as selected by (A) mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller or (B) absent such agreement during the 10-day period, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association (the "Title Arbitrator"). The Title Arbitrator shall not have had an affiliation with any Party or its Affiliates within the seven (7) year period preceding the arbitration, or have any financial interest in the dispute, controversy, or claim. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within 45 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon all Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Sections 3.4(g) and 3.4(h) and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the arbitrator, including without limitation title attorneys from other states and petroleum engineers. In no event shall any Title Defect Amount exceed the estimate given by Purchaser in its claim notice delivered in accordance with Section 3.4(a) and in no event shall any Title Benefit Amount exceed any estimate given by any Seller in a claim notice delivered in accordance with Section 3.4(b). The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Each Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Sellers shall bear one-half and Purchasers shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. (j) Sellers' election to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall not constitute a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature, or value of, or cost to cure, the Title Defect. SECTION 3.5 CONSENTS TO ASSIGNMENT AND PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS TO PURCHASE. (a) Promptly after the date hereof, Sellers shall prepare and send (i) notices to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are set forth on Schedule 4.16 requesting consents to the Conveyances and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 4.16 in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8 as to those Assets for which preferential purchase rights have not been exercised. The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset, subject to adjustment as described in Section 2.2. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained EXECUTION COPY -17-
and delivered prior to Closing, provided that Sellers shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents and waivers. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights. (b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a consent requirement has not been satisfied and which will terminate or in which the rights to be transferred to Purchaser will be materially impaired if transferred without the consent. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Asset(s) to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived consent requirement, the applicable Seller shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a consent requirement is a Property and the third Person consent to the transfer of the Property is not obtained by Closing, the affected Property and those Assets exclusively related to that Property shall not be transferred at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the affected Property and such related Assets. If an unsatisfied consent requirement with respect to which a Purchase Price adjustment is made under Section 3.4 is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of delivery of the final settlement statement under Section 8.4(b), a separate Closing shall be held at which (i) Sellers shall convey the affected Property and related Assets to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall pay the Allocated Value of such Property and related Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 2.2. If such consent requirement is not satisfied by the date of delivery of the final settlement statement, Sellers shall have no further obligation to sell and convey such Property and related Assets and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such Property and related Assets. (c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such Assets, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A (and Exhibits A-1, A-2, A-4 and A-5, as applicable) to this Agreement for all purposes. Sellers shall retain the consideration paid by the third Person. (d) Should a third Person fail to exercise its preferential right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of such Assets. If the applicable preferential purchase rights have been waived or expired prior to the date of delivery of the final settlement statement under Section 8.4(b), a separate Closing shall be held at which (i) Sellers shall convey the affected Assets to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall pay the Allocated Value of such Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 2.2. If such preferential purchase right has not been waived or has not expired by the date of delivery of the final settlement statement, Sellers shall have no further obligation to sell and convey the Assets affected thereby and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such Assets. EXECUTION COPY -18-
SECTION 3.6 CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION LOSS. If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close and Sellers shall elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing (i) to cause the Assets affected by any casualty to be repaired or restored, at Sellers' sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date and for which Purchaser agrees to give Sellers and their representatives reasonable access to the affected Assets, subject to Sellers' indemnity obligations set forth in Section 6.6(b)), in which case that portion of the Purchase Price equal to the lesser of the Allocated Value attributable to such affected Asset or the estimated amount of the loss will be placed at Closing into escrow under the Title Escrow Agreement as provided in Section 3.4(d) to be released either (a) to Sellers at such time as the casualty is repaired or restored, or (b) to Purchaser if such casualty is not repaired or restored, (ii) to indemnify Purchaser, with Purchaser's written consent, through a document reasonably acceptable to Sellers and Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair the Assets subject to any casualty or (iii) exclude the affected Assets from this Agreement for all purposes (in which event the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such Assets). In the event that the Assets are repaired or restored by Sellers under clause (i) or by Purchaser under clause (ii) and the repaired or restored Assets represent upgrades from the Assets that were damaged, destroyed or taken, Purchaser shall bear the portion of the cost of repair or restoration attributable to the increase in quality as a result of such upgrade. In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims against third parties with respect to the casualty or taking, except to the extent Purchaser has rights against any third party with respect to the casualty or taking after the Effective Time, and then only as to the period of time after the Effective Time, or the Parties otherwise agree in writing. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the aggregate losses caused by such casualties and takings exceed ten percent (10%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price, either Party may, by notice to the other prior to Closing, elect to terminate this Agreement under Section 9.1. SECTION 3.7 LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABILITY. Except as provided in Section 7.2(e), the representation and warranty in Section 3.1 shall terminate as of the Title Claim Date and shall have no further force and effect thereafter, provided there shall be no termination of Purchaser's or Sellers' rights under Section 3.4 with respect to any bona fide Title Defect or Title Benefit claim properly reported on or before the Title Claim Date. Thereafter, Purchaser's sole and exclusive rights and remedies with regard to title to the Assets shall be as set forth in the respective Conveyances transferring the Assets from Sellers to Purchaser.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, the termination of this Agreement under Section 9.1(iii) shall not relieve any Party from liability for any willful or negligent failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing. In the event this Agreement terminates under Section 9.1(iii) and any Party has willfully or negligently failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed at or prior to Closing, then, subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, the other Party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity and shall be entitled to recover court costs and attorneys' fees in addition to any other relief to which such Party maybe entitled.

EXECUTION COPY -42-
(d) Claims for Property Costs shall be exclusively handled pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustments in Section 2.2, and pursuant to Section 11.2, and shall not be subject to indemnification under this Section 10.1. (e) "Damages" shall mean the amount of any actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal injury or death, property damage, contract claims (including contractual indemnity claims), torts, or otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other agents and experts reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity; provided, however, that Purchaser and Sellers shall not be entitled to indemnification under Sections 10.1(a)(i), 10.1(a)(ii), 10.1(a)(iii), 10.1(b)(ii), 10.1(b)(iii) and 10.1(b)(v) for, and the term "Damages" as used in such subsections shall not include (i) loss of profits or other consequential damages suffered by the Party claiming indemnification, or any punitive damages, and (ii) any liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment that does not individually exceed $100,000. (f) The indemnity of each Party provided in this Section 10.1 shall be for the benefit of and extend to such Party's general partner and present and former Affiliates, and its and their directors, officers, employees, and agents. Any claim for indemnity under this Section 10.1 by any such Affiliate, director, officer, employee, or agent must be brought and administered by a Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than Sellers and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Sellers or Purchaser under the terms of this Section 10.1 except as may be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or any Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 10.1(f). Each Seller and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the other Indemnified Parties affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Party for any action or inaction under this Section. (g) Purchaser shall not conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) any material remediation operations with respect to any claimed Damages relating to a breach of any Seller's representation or warranty pursuant to Section 4.8 or any Claim relating to the subject matter of such representation or warranty without first giving Sellers notice of the remediation with reasonable detail at least 45 days prior thereto (or such shorter period of time as shall be required by any Governmental Authority). Sellers shall have the option (in their sole discretion) to conduct (or have conducted on their behalf) such remediation operations provided that any such remediation operations must begin within thirty (30) days after receiving notice from Purchaser and be diligently pursued thereafter and all such remediations must be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days of the commencement of remediation operations unless the Parties agree that a longer remediation period is required. If Sellers so elect, Purchaser will give Sellers and their representatives access to the affected Assets after Closing for such purpose, provided that the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 6.6(b) shall apply during any such post-Closing access. If Sellers shall not have notified Purchaser within such specified period of their agreement to conduct such remediation operations, or, if Sellers shall have not completed such remediation operations within the time periods described in the prior EXECUTION COPY -43-
sentence, then Purchaser may take over or conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) such operations, as appropriate. Purchaser and Sellers agree that any remediation activities undertaken with respect to the Assets, whether conducted by Purchaser or any Seller, shall be reasonable in extent and cost effective and shall not be designed or implemented in such a manner as to exceed what is required to cause a condition to be brought into compliance with Environmental Laws. All remediation activities conducted by any Seller under this Agreement shall be conducted to the extent reasonably possible so as not to interfere substantially with Purchaser's operation of the Assets. (h) For purposes of this Article 10, in determining whether there has occurred a breach of a representation or warranty of a Seller or Purchaser contained in or made pursuant to Articles 4 or 5 of this Agreement, as well as the amount of any Damages resulting therefrom, the provisions of Articles 4 or 5 that are qualified by a Material Adverse Effect or any other materiality qualifier shall be read and interpreted as if such qualification was not included therein. SECTION 10.2 INDEMNIFICATION ACTIONS. All claims for indemnification under Section 10.1 shall be asserted and resolved as follows: (a) For purposes of this Article 10 the term "Indemnifying Person" when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 10, and the term "Indemnified Person" when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Person or Persons pursuant to this Article 10. (b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 10.1, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section 10.2, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a "Third Person Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Person Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in this Section 10.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 10.1 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Third Person Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Person's ability to defend against the Third Person Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was inaccurate or breached. EXECUTION COPY -44-
(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Person Claim under this Article 10. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such 30-day period whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed to have denied such indemnification obligation hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person. (d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third Person Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Person Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Person Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 10.2(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Third Person Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity). (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for 10 days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity therefor. EXECUTION COPY -45-
(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such 30 day period that it has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder. SECTION 10.3 LIMITATION ON ACTIONS. (a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in Articles 4 and 5 and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Sections 6.1(a), 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 6.10, and the corresponding representations and warranties given in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(d) and 8.3(e), as applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of two years (unless a shorter period is expressly provided within the applicable section). Except as provided in Section 7.2(e), the representation and warranty of Sellers in Section 3.1 shall terminate at the Title Claim Date.

The remainder of this Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit except as may otherwise be expressly provided herein. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date. (b) The indemnities in Sections 10.1(a)(ii), 10.1(a)(iii), 10.1(b)(ii) and 10.1(b)(iii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date. The indemnities in Sections 10.1(a)(i), 10.1(b)(i), and 10.1(b)(iv) shall continue without time limit. The indemnity in Section 10.1(b)(v) shall survive the Closing for a period of two years; provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted under such indemnity prior to its expiration date. (c) Sellers shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section 10.1 until the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser, taken together with all Title Defect Amounts for Title Defects that were properly reported under Section 3.4(a), equals or exceeds the Basket, at which time Sellers shall have liability for indemnification for all such Damages (above and below the Basket) for which Claim Notices have been or are (in the future) delivered by Purchaser. The adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.2, any further adjustments with respect to production, income, proceeds, receipts and credits under Section 11.1, any further adjustments with respect to Property Costs under Section 11.2 and any payments in respect of any of the preceding shall not be limited by this Section. EXECUTION COPY -46-

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Article 10 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates). (f) In no event shall any Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Agreement and the various documents delivered in connection with the Closing. SECTION 10.4 RECORDING. As soon as practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall record the Conveyances and other assignments delivered at Closing in the appropriate counties as well as with the appropriate governmental agencies and provide Sellers with copies of all recorded or approved instruments. ARTICLE 11 MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 11.1 RECEIPTS.
