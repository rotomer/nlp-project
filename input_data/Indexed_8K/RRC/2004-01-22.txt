Approximately 75% of the Company's production in the quarter was natural gas.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS, January 21, 2004...RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC)
With the benefit of wells that went on production during the fourth quarter, those expected to go online shortly and the recent completed Conger Field acquisition, production growth is projected to accelerate in 2004. The Company currently expects first quarter 2004 production to reach 174 to 176 Mmcfe per day, a 13% increase over first quarter 2003 and a 6% increase over the most recent quarter.
Commenting on the announcement, John H. Pinkerton, Range's President, said, "Fourth quarter production increased as a result of our successful 2003 drilling program. In addition, the recent acquisition in the Conger Field in West Texas provides a steady stream of low-cost production that will continue for many years. Importantly, production is expected to increase throughout 2004 due to the ongoing exploitation of our extensive drilling inventory. Finally, with higher production, coupled with current oil and gas prices and hedges in place, the Company should report record results in 2004 for many of the key aspects of its business."
