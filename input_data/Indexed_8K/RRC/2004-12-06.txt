The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information shows the pro forma effect of the Great Lakes acquisition. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information includes a statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the nine months ended September 30, 2004 which assumes the merger occurred on January 1, 2003.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been prepared to assist in your analysis of the financial effects of the acquisition. It is based on the historical financial statements of Range and Great Lakes and should be read in conjunction with those historical financial statements and related notes, which were previously filed on Form 8-K/A dated August 17, 2004. The historical Great Lakes amounts presented represent the 50% not previously owned by the Company prior to the acquisition.
The pro forma information is based on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information. It is preliminary and is being furnished solely for information purposes. The pro forma information does not purport to represent what the financial position and the results of operations of the combined company would have actually been had the merger in fact occurred on the date indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that may occur in the future.

(1) Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited pro forma statements of operations present the pro forma effects of the Great Lakes acquisition. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations are presented as though the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2003.
(2) Method of accounting for the acquisition
Range accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. The purchase method of accounting requires that Great Lakes' assets and liabilities assumed by Range be revalued and recorded at their estimated "fair values."
The Company previously owned a 50% interest in Great Lakes, and as an investment in an LLC, accounted for its 50% ownership using the proportional consolidation method. Thus, 50% of Great Lakes assets and liabilities and operating results are included in the Company's historical financial statements.
On June 2, 2004, we agreed to purchase FirstEnergy's interest in Great Lakes for a cash purchase price of $200 million plus an optional cash payment equal to 50% of Great Lakes' commodity hedge liability ("Optional Hedging Payment") which was $27.7 million at closing on June 23, 2004. The transaction also includes the assumption of debt and other liabilities, which totaled $96.1 million and $1.3 in transaction expenses, for an aggregate anticipated purchase price of $325.1 million. In consideration for the Optional Hedging Payment, FirstEnergy reimbursed Great Lakes, as a capital contribution, for 50% of each commodity derivative position, and the Company did not assume any commodity derivative liabilities associated with the 50% purchased interest.
The calculation of the total purchase price and the allocation of this price to assets and liabilities are shown below:

The total purchase price included $1.3 million of estimated merger costs. These costs include investment banking expenses, legal and accounting fees, printing expenses and other acquisition related costs.
In order to finance the acquisition, the acquisition required the consolidation of the Great Lakes Credit Facility into an amended and restated senior credit facility, the issuance of 12,190,000 shares of Range common stock at a price of $12.25 and the issuance of $100.0 million of additional 7.375% senior subordinated notes. The stock transaction included transaction costs of $7.5 million and the issuance of 7.375% senior subordinated notes included transaction expenses of $3.0 million and a discount of $1.9 million. Fees for an amended and restated senior credit facility were $1.0 million.

Pro forma standardized measure of discounted future cash flows
The following table set forth the standardized measures of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves for Range, Great Lakes, and the combined company on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2003:
The "Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves" ("Standardized Measure") is a disclosure requirement of SFAS 69. The Standardized Measure does not purport to present the fair market value of proved oil and gas reserves. This would require consideration of expected future economic and operating conditions, which are not taken into account in calculating the Standardized Measure.
Table of Contents
Future cash inflows were estimated by applying year end prices to the estimated future production less estimated future production costs based on year end costs. Future net cash inflows were discounted using a 10% annual discount rate to arrive at the Standardized Measure. The average prices used at December 31, 2003 to estimate reserve information were $29.48 per barrel for oil, $19.93 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $6.03 per mcf for natural gas using the benchmark prices of $32.52 per barrel and $6.19 per Mmbtu.
