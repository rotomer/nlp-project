Certain information included in this report contains certain statements (other than statements of historical fact) that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Where any forward-looking statement includes a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying such forward-looking statement, we caution that while we believe these assumptions or bases to be reasonable and to be made in good faith, assumed facts or bases almost always vary from actual results and the difference between assumed facts or bases and the actual results could be material, depending on the circumstances. It is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those projected by such forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable and such forward-looking statements are based upon the best data available at the date this report is filed with the SEC, we cannot assure you that such expectations will prove correct. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: production variance from expectations, volatility of oil and gas prices, hedging results, the need to develop and replace reserves, the substantial capital expenditures required to fund operations, exploration risks, environmental risks, uncertainties about estimates of reserves, competition, litigation, government regulation, political risks, our ability to implement our business strategy, costs and results of drilling new projects, mechanical and other inherent risks associated with oil and gas production, weather, availability of drilling equipment and changes in interest rates. All such forward-looking statements in this document are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

The Board of Directors and Shareholder PMOG Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PMOG Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (Successor) as of December 31, 2003 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholder's equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2003 to August 12, 2003 (Predecessor period), and from August 13, 2003 to December 31, 2003, (Successor period). These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the aforementioned Successor financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PMOG Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the Successor period, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Further, in our opinion, the aforementioned Predecessor financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows for the Predecessor period, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective August 13, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary of PMOG Holdings, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding stock of the Predecessor in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. As a result of the acquisition, the financial information for the period after the acquisition is presented on a different cost basis than that for the period before the acquisition and, therefore, is not comparable.
As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted, in the predecessor period, the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, , in 2003.

On June 23, 2004, Range Resources Corporation (the "Company") closed on the acquisition of the 50% of Great Lakes Energy Partners, L.L.C. ("Great Lakes") that it did not previously own. On December 10, 2004, the Company closed on the acquisition of PMOG Holdings, Inc. ("Pine Mountain"). The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information shows the pro form effects of the Great Lakes and Pine Mountain acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information includes a statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the nine months ended September 30, 2004 which assumes the mergers occurred on January 1, 2003 and an unaudited balance sheet for September 30, 2004 which assumes the Pine Mountain acquisition occurred on that date (the Great Lakes acquisition had already occurred).
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been prepared to assist in your analysis of the financial effects of the acquisitions. The pro forma amounts for the Great Lakes acquisition are based on the historical financial statements of Range and Great Lakes and should be read in conjunction with those historical financial statements and related notes, which were previously filed on Form 8-K/A dated August 17, 2004. The historical Great Lakes amounts presented represent the 50% not previously owned by the Company prior to the acquisition. The pro forma amounts for the Pine Mountain acquisition are also based on historical financial statements of Range and Pine Mountain and should be read in conjunction with those historical financial statements and related notes. The Pine Mountain financial statements are included herein.
The pro forma information is based on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information. It is preliminary and is being furnished solely for information purposes. The pro forma information does not purport to represent what the financial position and the results of operations of the combined company would have actually been had the merger in fact occurred on the date indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that may occur in the future.

(1) Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited pro forma statements of operations present the pro forma effects of the Great Lakes and Pine Mountain acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations are presented as though the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet for September 30, 2004 is presented as though the Pine Mountain acquisition occurred on that date.
(2) Pro forma adjustments related to the Pine Mountain acquisition
The unaudited pro forma balance sheet includes the following adjustments:
Calculation and preliminary allocation of purchase price (in thousands):
Plus fair value of liabilities assumed (in thousands):
Fair value of Pine Mountain assets (in thousands):
The total purchase price includes $500,000 of estimated merger costs. These costs include legal and accounting fees. The purchase also results in the reversal of the Pine Mountain deferred taxes retained earnings and other comprehensive income and an accrual of $670,000 of incentive costs to be paid to Pine Mountain employees.
Table of Contents
The purchase price is preliminary and is subject to change due to several factors, including (1) changes in the fair values of Pine Mountain's assets and liabilities as of the effective time of the acquisition, (2) actual acquisition costs incurred, (3) changes in Range's valuation estimates that may be made between now and the effective time of the acquisition. These changes will not be known until after the effective time of the acquisition. However, Range does not believe that the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the estimated allocation present herein.
The unaudited pro forma statement of operations includes the following adjustments:
(3) Method of accounting for the Great Lakes acquisition
Range accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. The purchase method of accounting requires that Great Lakes' assets and liabilities assumed by Range be revalued and recorded at their estimated "fair values."
The Company previously owned a 50% interest in Great Lakes, and as an investment in an LLC, accounted for its 50% ownership using the proportional consolidation method. Thus, 50% of Great Lakes assets and liabilities and operating results are included in the Company's historic financial statements.
On June 2, 2004, we agreed to purchase FirstEnergy's interest in Great Lakes for a cash purchase price of $200.0 million plus an optional cash payment equal to 50% of Great Lakes' commodity hedge liability ("Optional Hedging Payment") which was $27.7 million at closing on June 23, 2004. The transaction also includes the assumption of debt and other liabilities, which totaled $96.1 million and $1.3 in transaction expenses, for an aggregate anticipated purchase price of $325.1 million. In consideration for the Optional Hedging Payment, FirstEnergy reimbursed Great Lakes, as a capital contribution, for 50% of each commodity derivative position, and the Company did not assume any commodity derivative liabilities associated with the 50% purchased interest.
Table of Contents
The calculation of the total purchase price and the allocation of this price to assets and liabilities are shown below:
Calculation and preliminary allocation of purchase price (in thousands):
Plus fair value of liabilities assumed (in thousands):
Fair value of Great Lakes assets (in thousands):
The total purchase price included $1.3 million of estimated merger costs. These costs include investment banking expenses, legal and accounting fees, printing expenses and other acquisition related costs.
In order to finance the acquisition, the acquisition required the consolidation of the Great Lakes Credit Facility into an amended and restated senior credit facility, the issuance of 12,190,000 shares of Range common stock at a price of $12.25 and the issuance of $100.0 million of additional 7.375% senior subordinated notes. The stock transaction included transaction costs of $7.5 million and the issuance of 7.375% senior subordinated notes included transaction expense of $3.0 million and a discount of $1.9 million. Fees for amended and restated senior credit facility were $1.0 million.
The unaudited pro forma statements of operations include the following adjustments:

Pro forma standardized measure of discounted future cash flows
The following table sets forth the standardized measures of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves for Range, Great Lakes, Pine Mountain and the combined company on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2003:
The "Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves" ("Standardized Measure") is a disclosure requirement of SFAS 69. The Standardized Measure does not purport to present the fair value of oil and gas reserves. This would require consideration of expected future economic and operating conditions, which are not taken into account in calculating the Standardized Measure.
Future cash inflows were estimated by applying year-end prices to the estimated future production less estimated future production costs based on year-end costs. Future net cash inflows were discounted using a 10% annual discount rate to arrive at the Standardized Measure.

In the event that Buyer's Phase I environmental property assessments identify actual or potential "recognized environmental concerns", then Buyer may request Sellers' permission to conduct additional Phase II environmental property assessments. The additional Phase II environmental property assessment procedures relating to any additional investigation shall be submitted to Sellers in a Phase II environmental property assessment plan. Thereafter, Sellers may, in their sole discretion, approve said Phase II environmental property assessment plan, in whole or in part and Buyer shall not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such plan until such time that Sellers have approved such plan in writing. Any such approved Phase II environmental property assessment plan shall be performed in accordance with this and in compliance with all Laws.

          (c) . In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law, elect with the relevant Governmental Entity to treat for all purposes September 30, 2004 as the last day of the Tax year or period of each Purchased Company. In any case
Division of the Straddle Period
 
where applicable law does not permit any Purchased Company to treat September 30, 2004 as the last day of the Tax year or period with respect to Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on September 30, 2004 will be:
               (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) income Taxes or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (other than any Taxes imposed on any sales conveyance made pursuant to this Agreement or contemplated by transactions described herein, the payment of which is governed by ), deemed equal to the amount that would have been payable had the relevant Tax year or period ended on September 30, 2004 (except that, solely for purposes of determining the marginal tax rate applicable to the income or receipts during such period in a jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon the level of income or receipts, annualized income or receipts may be taken into account, if appropriate for an equitable sharing of such Taxes); and

               (ii) in the case of Taxes not included in clause (i) of this that are imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the level of any item (including real estate tax regardless of whether such tax is payable to a taxing authority, a landlord or other third party), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on September 30, 2004 and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.
Section 6.14(c)
          In determining the Straddle Period for real estate Taxes, the Tax period as reflected on the statement of Taxes due, property Tax bill, property "tax ticket," or any other request for payment from a Governmental Entity will determine the taxable period (, a West Virginia Statement of Taxes Due that indicates the tax year as 2002 is for a Tax for the taxable period January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002). In determining the Straddle Period for franchise, doing business and capital Taxes, the period for which the payment of any such Tax provides the right to do business will determine the taxable period (, a state franchise tax payable for the right to do business for the calendar year 2002 is a Tax for the taxable period January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002).

that the Buyer Group received or reasonably expected to be received in respect of or as a result of such Losses, less the reasonable costs incurred by the Buyer Group to recover those insurance benefits to the extent such costs are not otherwise recovered and (ii) any net Tax benefit realized by the Buyer Group in respect of or as a result of such Losses. For this purpose, the amount of any "net Tax benefit" shall be computed assuming the Buyer Group has recognized all other items for the relevant year of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit before recognizing any item with respect to the incurrence of any Loss.

In such instances, the Indemnitee shall have full control of such defense and proceedings.

The Escrow Agent may use a broker-dealer of its own selection, including a broker-dealer owned by or affiliated with the Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates.

Right of Interpleader.
     10. The Other Parties hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent, its officers, directors, partners, employees and agents (each hereinafter referred to as an "Indemnified Party") against, and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, losses, costs, damages and claims, including, but not limited to, costs of investigation, litigation, tax liability suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with or arising from or out of this Escrow Agreement, except such acts or omissions as may result from the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of, or material breach of this Escrow Agreement by, such Indemnified Party. . If any action or proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party with respect to which indemnity may be sought from the Other Parties pursuant to this section, or an Indemnified Party receives notice from any potential claimant, such Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as practicable after receiving notice thereof, give written notice to the Other Parties of the commencement of such action or proceeding or of the existence of any such claim (any such action, proceeding or notice hereinafter referred to as a "Claim") and furnish the Other Parties with copies of any summons or other legal process received by such Indemnified Party and other documents and information in the possession of such Indemnified Party as to the nature and basis of the claim; that no failure to
Indemnification.
IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENT OF EACH OF FIRST RESERVE AND BUYER TO INDEMNIFY EACH OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FOR, AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST, FIRST RESERVE'S OR BUYER'S NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS
provided,
 
give or delay in giving such notice or such documents and information shall relieve the Other Parties from any of their indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent such obligations could have been reduced or avoided in the absence of such failure or delay. In case any such Claim shall be brought against any Indemnified Party, the Other Parties will be entitled to participate in the defense of such Claim, and, after written notice from the Other Parties to such Indemnified Party, to jointly assume the defense of such Claim with a single counsel mutually agreed upon and appointed by the Other Parties and which counsel is reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party at the Other Parties' joint expense or, alternatively, if only one, but not both, of the Other Parties elects to assume the defense of such Claim, then such party will, after written notice to the non-electing Other Party and such Indemnified Party, be entitled to defend such Claim separately with the cost of such defense to be shared equally by the Other Parties (in each case the Other Parties shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and disbursements of any separate counsel retained by such Indemnified Party in connection with such action or proceeding, except as provided below in this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Other Parties shall jointly assume the defense of any Claim against any Indemnified Party, such defense shall be jointly controlled by the Other Parties and all decisions relating thereto shall be mutually agreed upon by the Other Parties. If only one of the Other Parties shall elect to assume the defense of any Claim separately, such party shall obtain the prior written consent of (i) the non-electing Other Party before entering into any settlement of such Claim if the settlement imposes any cost, expense or obligation on the non-electing Other Party or does not expressly and unconditionally release the non-electing Other Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim and (ii) the Indemnified Party if the settlement imposes any cost, expense or obligation on the Indemnified Party or does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim. Notwithstanding any election by the Other Parties to assume the defense of any such Claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim at the Indemnified Party's expense; that such Indemnified Party shall not have the right to settle any such Claim without the prior written consent of the Other Parties. The Other Parties agree to pay the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of such separate counsel only if (i) the use of counsel jointly chosen by the Other Parties to represent such Indemnified Party would present an actual conflict of interest which it would be unreasonable to waive or (ii) the Other Parties shall authorize such Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Other Parties' joint expense. If the Other Parties do not elect, jointly or separately, to assume the defense of a Claim against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Other Parties before entering into any settlement of such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9 or in this Section 10, the Other Parties agree, as between themselves, to share in the aggregate amount of any reimbursable costs pursuant to Section 9 or indemnifiable costs pursuant to this Section 10 for which any Indemnified Party may be liable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect their respective relative fault in connection with the acts or omissions which resulted in such costs. The relative fault of First Reserve and Buyer shall be determined by reference to whether the acts or omissions at issue were those of First Reserve or Buyer respectively. If any amount paid by First Reserve or Buyer pursuant to this Section 10 is in excess of the amount allocable to it in accordance with the provisions of this section, it
provided, however,
 
shall be entitled to reimbursement of such excess amount (plus all reasonable attorneys' fees and documented expenses incurred in connection with enforcing this provision) from the other.
     11. Upon execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Buyer and First Reserve shall each pay one-half of the Escrow Agent's fee for services hereunder in accordance with the Escrow Agent's fee schedule as attached as Schedule I hereto. In addition, each of Buyer and First Reserve agree to pay one-half of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and enforcement of its rights hereunder and otherwise in connection with the operation, administration and enforcement of this Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, brokerage costs and related expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent, in each case to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with such performance (collectively, "Other Expenses"). Buyer and First Reserve shall be jointly and severally liable to the Escrow Agent for the payment of all Other Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and First Reserve shall not be responsible for any Other Expenses to the extent such expenses arise out of, relate to or result from the Escrow Agent's material breach of this Escrow Agreement or the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the Escrow Agent. In the even the Other Parties for any reason fail to pay any such fees and expenses as and when the same are due, such unpaid fees and expenses shall be charged to and set-off and paid from the Deposit by Escrow Agent without any further notice.
Compensation and Reimbursement of Expenses.
     12. All disbursements of the Deposit shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. Federal Funds to an account or accounts designated by the payee therefor. In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by telefax, or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule II hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule II, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of your executive officers, ("Executive Officers"), which shall include (a) in the case of Buyer, the titles of Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President Corporate Development and (b) in the case of First Reserve, the titles of Vice President, Manager or Director, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such "Executive Officer" shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is commercially reasonable.
Funds Transfer.
     It is understood that the Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number provided by either of the Other Parties hereto to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary's bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even where its use may
 
result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank or an intermediary bank, designated.
     13. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given under this Escrow Agreement by any party hereto to any other party hereto shall be considered as properly given if in writing and (a) delivered against receipt therefor, (b) mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid or (c) sent by telefax machine, in each case to the address or telefax number, as the case may be, set forth below:

Any party to this Escrow Agreement may change the address to which communications hereunder are to be directed by giving written notice to the other party or parties hereto in the manner provided in this section. All signatures of the parties to this Escrow Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile, and such facsimile will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party.
     14. The Escrow Agent may consult with its counsel or other counsel satisfactory to it concerning any question relating to its duties or responsibilities hereunder or otherwise in connection herewith and shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith upon the advice of such counsel.
Consultation with Legal Counsel.
     15. All of the Escrow Agent's rights hereunder are cumulative of any other rights it may have at law, in equity or otherwise. This Escrow Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas.
Choice of Laws; Cumulative Rights; Jurisdiction.
     16. The Escrow Agent may resign hereunder upon thirty (30) days prior notice to the Other Parties. Upon the effective date of such resignation, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to any substitute escrow agent designated by the Other Parties in writing. If the Other Parties fail to designate a substitute escrow agent within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice, the Escrow Agent may institute a petition for interpleader. The Escrow Agent's sole responsibility after such 30-day notice period expires shall be to hold the Deposit (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction at which time of delivery the Escrow Agent's obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. The Escrow Agent or successor agent shall continue to act as escrow agent hereunder until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as the escrow agent.
Resignation.
     17. By mutual agreement, Buyer and First Reserve shall have the right at any time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent to terminate their appointment of the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent, or any successor escrow agent, as escrow agent hereunder. The Escrow Agent or successor agent

shall continue to act as escrow agent hereunder until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as the escrow agent.
     18. Neither First Reserve nor Buyer shall have the right to assign this Escrow Agreement or any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other and any attempted assignment without the required consent of such other party shall be void.
Assignment.
     19. If one or more of the provisions hereof shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under applicable law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and this Escrow Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein, and the remaining provisions hereof shall be given full force and effect.
Severability.
     20. This Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the disbursement, in accordance with Sections 4 or 16 hereof, of the Deposit in full; that in the event all fees, expenses, costs and other amounts required to be paid to the Escrow Agent hereunder are not fully and finally paid prior to termination, the provisions of Sections 9 and 10 hereof and the last two sentences of Section 8 hereof shall survive the termination hereof.
Termination.
provided, however,
     21. Except as set forth in the last sentence of Section 11 hereof, Escrow Agent hereby waives any and all rights to offset that it may have against the Deposit including, without limitation, claims arising as a result of any claims, amounts, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, or other losses that Escrow Agent may be otherwise entitled to collect from any party to this Escrow Agreement.
Waiver of Offset Rights.

Section 4(a)
Agreement
Escrow Agent
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this Joint Notice to be executed and delivered on this [___] day of [___], 200___.
 
ACTIVITY FEES:
There will be no legal expense for Chase if Chase's standard form escrow agreement is employed without substantive amendments.
 
A New Account Acceptance Fee will be charged for the Bank's review of the Escrow Agreement along with any related account documentation. A one (1) year Minimum Administrative Fee will be assessed for any account which is funded. The account will be invoiced in the month in which the account is opened and annually thereafter. Payment of the invoice is due 30 days following receipt.
The Administrative Fee will cover a maximum of fifteen (15) annual administrative hours for the Bank's standard Escrow services including account setup, safekeeping of assets, investment of funds, collection of income and other receipts, preparation of statements comprising account activity and asset listing, and distribution of assets in accordance with the specific terms of the Escrow Agreement.
Extraordinary Services and Out-of Pocket Expenses:
Any additional services beyond our standard services as specified above, such as annual administrative activities in excess of fifteen (15) hours and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including attorney's fees will be considered extraordinary services for which related costs, transaction charges, and additional fees will be billed at the Bank's standard rate.
Modification of Fees:
Circumstances may arise necessitating a change in the foregoing fee schedule. The Bank will attempt at all times, however, to maintain the fees at a level which is fair and reasonable in relation to the responsibilities assumed and the duties performed.
Assumptions:
All fees quoted are subject to our review and acceptance, and that of our legal counsel, of the documents governing the escrow. As a condition for acceptance of an appointment, it is expected that all legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by JPMorgan Chase Bank and our counsel in connection with our review of the transaction will be paid by the client regardless of whether or not the transaction closes.
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When an account is opened, we will ask for information that will allow us to identify relevant parties.
