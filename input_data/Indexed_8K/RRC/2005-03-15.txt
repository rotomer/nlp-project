The notes were offered by the initial purchasers pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, and may not be sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.

     Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement dated March 9, 2005 between Range Resources Corporation and the Initial Purchasers of the 6-3/8% Notes, we have agreed, at our expense, to (i) file a registration statement within 90 days after the issue date of the 6-3/8% Notes enabling the holders to exchange the privately placed 6-3/8% Notes for registered notes with substantially similar terms, (except that the exchange notes shall not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions or liquidated damages upon a Registration Default, as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 180 days after the issue date of the 6-3/8% Notes, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to complete the exchange offer within 210 days after the issue date of the 6-3/8% Notes and (iv) file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the 6-3/8% Notes if we cannot effect an exchange offer within the time periods listed above. The interest rate on the 6-3/8% Notes will increase if we do not comply with our obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement.

Definitions. "Acquired Debt" means, with respect to any specified Person, (i) Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged with or into or became a Subsidiary of such specified Person, including, without limitation, Indebtedness incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such other Person merging with or into or becoming a Subsidiary of such specified Person, and (ii) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified Person. "Additional Notes" means any notes issued under the Indenture in addition to the Original Notes, including any Exchange Notes issued in exchange for such Additional Notes, having the same terms in all respects as the Original Notes except that the date from which interest on the Additional Notes will accrue may be different. "Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets" means (without duplication), as of the date of determination, (i) the sum of (a) discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries calculated in accordance with the Commission's guidelines before any state or federal income taxes, with no less than 80% of the discounted future net revenues estimated by one or more nationally recognized firms of independent petroleum engineers in a reserve report prepared as of the end of the Company's most recently completed fiscal year, as increased by, as of the date of determination, the estimated discounted future net revenues from (1) estimated proved oil and gas reserves acquired since the date of such year-end reserve report, and (2) estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to upward revisions of estimates of proved oil and gas reserves since the date of such year-end reserve report due to exploration, development or exploitation activities, in each case calculated in accordance with the Commission's guidelines (utilizing the prices utilized in such 1
year-end reserve report) increased by the accretion of the discount from the date of the reserve report to the date of determination, and decreased by, as of the date of determination, the estimated discounted future net revenues from (3) estimated proved oil and gas reserves produced or disposed of since the date of such year-end reserve report and (4) estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to downward revisions of estimates of proved oil and gas reserves since the date of such year-end reserve report due to changes in geological conditions or other factors which would, in accordance with standard industry practice, cause such revisions, in each case calculated in accordance with the Commission's guidelines (utilizing the prices utilized in such year-end reserve report); provided that, in the case of each of the determinations made pursuant to clause (1) through (4), such increases and decreases shall be as estimated by the Company's petroleum engineers, unless in the event that there is a Material Change as a result of such acquisitions, dispositions or revisions, then the discounted future net revenues utilized for purposes of this clause (i) (a) shall be confirmed in writing by one or more nationally recognized firms of independent petroleum engineers, (b) the capitalized costs that are attributable to oil and gas properties of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to which no proved oil and gas reserves are attributable, based on the Company's books and records as of a date no earlier than the date of the Company's latest annual or quarterly financial statements, (c) the Net Working Capital on a date no earlier than the date of the Company's latest annual or quarterly financial statements and (d) the greater of (1) the net book value on a date no earlier than the date of the Company's latest annual or quarterly financial statements or (2) the book value of other tangible assets (including, without duplication, investments in unconsolidated Restricted Subsidiaries and mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements) of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as of the date no earlier than the date of the Company's latest annual or quarterly financial statements, minus (ii) the sum of (a) minority interests, (b) any gas balancing liabilities of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries reflected in the Company's latest audited financial statements, and (c) the discounted future net revenues, calculated in accordance with the Commission's guidelines, attributable to reserves subject to Dollar-Denominated Production Payments which, based on the estimates of production and price assumptions included in determining the discounted future net revenues specified in (i) (a) above, would be necessary to fully satisfy the payment obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries with respect to Dollar-Denominated Production Payments on the schedules specified with respect thereto.

If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity must be furnished that is sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company and the Trustee from any loss they may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Company may charge the Holder for the expenses of the Company and the Trustee in replacing a Note. In case the mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may pay the Note instead of issuing a replacement Note. Section 2.05. Outstanding Notes. (a) Notes outstanding at any time are all Notes that have been authenticated by the Trustee except for (1) Notes cancelled by the Trustee or delivered to it for cancellation; (2) any Note which has been replaced pursuant to Section 2.04 unless and until the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser; and (3) on or after the maturity date or any redemption date or date for repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer, those Notes payable or to be redeemed or repurchased on that date for which the Trustee (or Paying Agent, other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds money sufficient to pay all amounts then due. (b) A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Affiliates holds the Note, provided that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Notes have given or taken any request, demand, 23
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action hereunder, Notes owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, (it being understood that in determining whether the Trustee is protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, only Notes which the Trustee knows to be so owned will be so disregarded). Notes so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company or any Affiliate of the Company. Section 2.06. Temporary Notes. Until definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee will authenticate temporary Notes.

If temporary Notes are issued, the Company will cause definitive Notes to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Notes, the temporary Notes will be exchangeable for definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at the office or agency of the Company designated for the purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any temporary Notes the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Notes of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes will be entitled to the same benefits under the Indenture as definitive Notes. Section 2.07. Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold. Any Registrar or the Paying Agent will forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to it for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee will cancel all Notes surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and dispose of them in accordance with its document retention procedures or the written instructions of the Company. The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes it has paid in full or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Section 2.08. CUSIP and CINS Numbers. The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" and "CINS" numbers, and the Trustee will use CUSIP numbers or CINS numbers in notices of redemption or exchange or in Offers to Purchase as a convenience to Holders, the notice to state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption or exchange. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP or CINS numbers. 24
Section 2.09. Registration, Transfer and Exchange. (a) The Notes will be issued in registered form only, without coupons, and the Company shall cause the Trustee to maintain a register (the "Register") of the Notes, for registering the record ownership of the Notes by the Holders and transfers and exchanges of the Notes. (b) (1) Each Global Note will be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee and, so long as DTC is serving as the Depositary thereof, will bear the DTC Legend. (2) Each Global Note will be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for the Depositary. Transfers of a Global Note (but not a beneficial interest therein) will be limited to transfers thereof in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees, except (1) as set forth in Section 2.09(b)(4) and (2) transfers of portions thereof in the form of Certificated Notes may be made upon request of an Agent Member (for itself or on behalf of a beneficial owner) by written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures of the Depositary and in compliance with this Section and Section 2.10. (3) Agent Members will have no rights under the Indenture with respect to any Global Note held on their behalf by the Depositary, and the Depositary shall be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary or its nominee may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person (including any Agent Member and any Person that holds a beneficial interest in a Global Note through an Agent Member) to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Notes, and nothing herein will impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any security. (4) If (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for a Global Note and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the notice or (y) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee has received a request from the Depositary, the Trustee will promptly exchange each beneficial interest in the Global Note for one or more Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an equal aggregate principal amount registered in the name of the owner of such beneficial interest, as identified to the Trustee by the Depositary, and thereupon the Global Note will be deemed canceled. If such Note does not bear the Restricted Legend, then the Certificated Notes issued in exchange therefor will not bear the Restricted Legend. If such Note bears the Restricted Legend, then the Certificated Notes issued in exchange therefor will bear the Restricted Legend, provided that any Holder of any such Certificated Note issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Temporary Offshore Global Note will have the right upon presentation to the Trustee of a duly completed Certificate of Beneficial Ownership after the Restricted Period to exchange such Certificated Note for a Certificated Note of like tenor and amount that does not bear the Restricted Legend, registered in the name of such Holder. 25
(c) Each Certificated Note will be registered in the name of the holder thereof or its nominee. (d) A Holder may transfer a Note (or a beneficial interest therein) to another Person or exchange a Note (or a beneficial interest therein) for another Note or Notes of any authorized denomination by presenting to the Trustee a written request therefor stating the name of the proposed transferee or requesting such an exchange, accompanied by any certification, opinion or other document required by Section 2.10. The Trustee will promptly register any transfer or exchange that meets the requirements of this Section by noting the same in the register maintained by the Trustee for the purpose; provided that (x) no transfer or exchange will be effective until it is registered in such register and (y) the Trustee will not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or repurchased, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Note so selected for redemption or repurchase in whole or in part, except, in the case of a partial redemption or repurchase, that portion of any Note not being redeemed or repurchased, or (iii) if a redemption or a repurchase is to occur after a regular record date but on or before the corresponding related interest payment date, to register the transfer of or exchange any Note on or after the regular record date and before the date of redemption or repurchase. Prior to the registration of any transfer, the Company, the Trustee and their agents will treat the Person in whose name the Note is registered as the owner and Holder thereof for all purposes (whether or not the Note is overdue), and will not be affected by notice to the contrary. From time to time the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate additional Notes as necessary in order to permit the registration of a transfer or exchange in accordance with this Section. No service charge will be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of any Note, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than a transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchange pursuant to subsection (b)(4)). (e) (1) Global Note to Global Note. If a beneficial interest in a Global Note is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in another Global Note, the Trustee will (x) record a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Note being transferred or exchanged equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (y) record a like increase in the principal amount of the other Global Note. Any beneficial interest in one Global Note that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note, or exchanged for an interest in another Global Note, will, upon transfer or exchange, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer and exchange restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such an interest. 26
(2) Global Note to Certificated Note. If a beneficial interest in a Global Note is transferred or exchanged for a Certificated Note, the Trustee will (x) record a decrease in the principal amount of such Global Note equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (y) deliver one or more new Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an equal aggregate principal amount to the transferee (in the case of a transfer) or the owner of such beneficial interest (in the case of an exchange), registered in the name of such transferee or owner, as applicable. (3) Certificated Note to Global Note. If a Certificated Note is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Note, the Trustee will (x) cancel such Certificated Note, (y) record an increase in the principal amount of such Global Note equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (z) in the event that such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Certificated Note, deliver to the Holder thereof one or more new Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Certificated Note, registered in the name of the Holder thereof. (4) Certificated Note to Certificated Note. If a Certificated Note is transferred or exchanged for another Certificated Note, the Trustee will (x) cancel the Certificated Note being transferred or exchanged, (y) deliver one or more new Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange to the transferee (in the case of a transfer) or the Holder of the canceled Certificated Note (in the case of an exchange), registered in the name of such transferee or Holder, as applicable, and (z) if such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Certificated Note, deliver to the Holder thereof one or more Certificated Notes in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Certificated Note, registered in the name of the Holder thereof. Section 2.10. Restrictions on Transfer and Exchange. (a) The transfer or exchange of any Note (or a beneficial interest therein) may only be made in accordance with this Section and Section 2.09 and, in the case of a Global Note (or a beneficial interest therein), the applicable rules and procedures of the Depositary. The Trustee shall refuse to register any requested transfer or exchange that does not comply with the preceding sentence. (b) Subject to paragraph (c), the transfer or exchange of any Note (or a beneficial interest therein) of the type set forth in column A below for a Note (or a beneficial interest therein) of the type set forth opposite in column B below may only be made in compliance with the certification requirements (if any) described in the clause of this paragraph set forth opposite in column C below. 27
(1) No certification is required.

In the event that (i) the requested transfer or exchange takes place after the Restricted Period and a duly completed Regulation S Certificate is delivered to the Trustee or (ii) a Certificated Note that does not bear the Restricted Legend is surrendered for transfer or exchange, upon transfer or exchange the Trustee will deliver a Certificated Note that does not bear the Restricted Legend. (4) The Person requesting the transfer or exchange must deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee a duly completed Rule 144A Certificate. (5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no such exchange is permitted if the requested exchange involves a beneficial interest in a Temporary Offshore Global Note. If the requested transfer involves a beneficial interest in a Temporary Offshore Global Note, the Person requesting the transfer must deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee a duly completed Rule 144A Certificate and/or an Opinion of Counsel and such other certifications and evidence as the Company may reasonably require in order to determine that the proposed transfer is being made in compliance with the Securities Act and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. If the requested transfer or exchange involves a beneficial interest in a Permanent Offshore Global Note, no certification is required and the Trustee will deliver a Certificated Note that does not bear the Restricted Legend. (c) No certification is required in connection with any transfer or exchange of any Note (or a beneficial interest therein) 28
(1) after such Note is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or a successor provision); provided that the Company has provided the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate to that effect, and the Company may require from any Person requesting a transfer or exchange in reliance upon this clause (1) an opinion of counsel and any other reasonable certifications and evidence in order to support such certificate; or (2) (x) sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or (y) which is validly tendered for exchange into an Exchange Note pursuant to an Exchange Offer. Any Certificated Note delivered in reliance upon this paragraph will not bear the Restricted Legend. (d) The Trustee will retain copies of all certificates, opinions and other documents received in connection with the transfer or exchange of a Note (or a beneficial interest therein), and the Company will have the right to inspect and make copies thereof at any reasonable time upon written notice to the Trustee.

(b) An owner of a beneficial interest in a Temporary Offshore Global Note (or a Person acting on behalf of such an owner) may provide to the Trustee (and the Trustee will accept) a duly completed Certificate of Beneficial Ownership at any time after the Restricted Period (it being understood that the Trustee will not accept any such certificate during the Restricted Period). Promptly after acceptance of a Certificate of Beneficial Ownership with respect to such a beneficial interest, the Trustee will cause such beneficial interest to be exchanged for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Permanent Offshore Global Note, and will (x) permanently reduce the principal amount of such Temporary Offshore Global Note by the amount of such beneficial interest and (y) increase the principal amount of such Permanent Offshore Global Note by the amount of such beneficial interest.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no owner of a beneficial interest in a Temporary Offshore Global Note shall be entitled to receive payment of principal or interest on such beneficial interest or other amounts in respect of such beneficial 29
interest until such beneficial interest is exchanged for an interest in a Permanent Offshore Global Note or transferred for an interest in another Global Note or a Certificated Note. Section 2.12. Defaulted Interest. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, it shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, provided that no such special record date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest.

ARTICLE 3 REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT Section 3.01. Notices to Trustee.

Section 3.02. Selection of Notes to be Redeemed. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of Notes for redemption shall be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, or, if the Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements); provided that no Notes of $1,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. In the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Notes to be redeemed shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the Trustee from the outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Note selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Notes and portions of Notes selected shall be in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof shall be 30
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption. Except as provided in this Section 3.02, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs of this Section 3.02 shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a Global Note, whether such Global Note is to be redeemed in whole or in part.

Subject to the provisions of Section 3.09 hereof, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address, provided, however, that the Company shall provide notice to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof at least three days (or such shorter period as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) prior to the mailing of the notice pursuant to this Section 3.03. The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state: (a) the redemption date; (b) the redemption price; (c) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date upon surrender of such Note, a new Notes or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note; (d) the name and address of the Paying Agent; (e) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; (f) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Notes called for redemption cease to accrue on and after the redemption date; (g) the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; and (h) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes. If any of the Notes to be redeemed is in the form of a Global Note, then such notice shall be modified in form but not substance to the extent appropriate to accord with the procedures of the Depositary applicable to redemptions. 31

Section 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price. A notice of redemption may not be conditional. Section 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price.

If the Company complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the redemption date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption. If a Note is redeemed on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. Section 3.06. Notes Redeemed in Part.

Offer to Purchase by Application of Excess Proceeds. In the event that, pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof, the Company shall be required to commence an offer to all Holders of Notes and, to the extent required by the terms thereof, to all holders or lenders of other pari passu Indebtedness, to repurchase Notes and any such pari passu Indebtedness (an "Asset Sale Offer"), it shall follow the procedures specified below. The Asset Sale Offer shall remain open for a period of 20 Business Days following its commencement and no longer, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the "Offer Period"). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the "Purchase Date"), the Company shall purchase the principal amount of Notes required to be purchased pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof, giving effect to any related offer for pari passu Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.10, (the "Offer Amount") or, if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer. Payment for any Notes so purchased shall be made in the same manner as interest payments are made.

The notice shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer. The Asset Sale Offer shall be made to all Holders. The notice, which shall govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, shall state: (a) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 3.09 and Section 4.10 hereof and the length of time the Asset Sale Offer shall remain open; (b) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date; (c) that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment shall continue to accrue interest; (d) that, unless the Company defaults in making such payment, any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date; (e) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer may only elect to have all of such Note purchased and may not elect to have only a portion of such Note purchased; (f) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Company, the Depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days before the Purchase Date; (g) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company, the Depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives, not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased; (h) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that only Notes in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased) in the manner provided in Section 4.10; and (i) that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry transfer). If any of the Notes subject to an Asset Sale Offer is in the form of a Global Note, then such notice may be modified in form but not substance to the extent appropriate to accord with the procedures of the Depositary applicable to repurchases. 34

The Company, the Depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any case not later than five days after the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written authentication order of the Company signed by two Officers of the Company shall authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. Any Note not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase Date. Other than as specifically provided in this Section 3.09, any purchase pursuant to this Section 3.09 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 hereof.

The Company shall pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the dates and in the manner provided in the Notes. Principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent, if other than the Company or a Subsidiary thereof, holds as of 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the due date money deposited by the Company in immediately available funds and designated for and sufficient to pay all such amounts then due.

The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such 35
required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. Section 4.03. Reports.

In the event that the Company is not permitted to file such reports, documents and information with the Commission, the Company will provide substantially similar information to the Trustee, the Holders and prospective Holders (upon request) as if the Company were subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

As of the date hereof, the Company's fiscal year ends on December 31 of each calendar year. In the event the Company changes its fiscal year, it shall promptly notify the Trustee of such change. (b) So long as not contrary to the then current recommendations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the fiscal year-end financial statements delivered 36
pursuant to Section 4.03(a) above shall be accompanied by a written statement of the Company's independent public accountants (who shall be a firm of established national reputation) that in making the examination necessary for certification of such financial statements, nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the Company has violated any provisions of Article 4 or Article 5 hereof or, if any such violation has occurred, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof, it being understood that such accountants shall not be liable directly or indirectly to any Person for any failure to obtain knowledge of any such violation. (c) The Company shall, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, within five Business Days of any Officer becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

The Company shall pay, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay, prior to delinquency all material taxes, assessments, and governmental levies except such as are contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings or where the failure to effect such payment is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes. Section 4.06. Stay, Extension and Usury Laws Each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted. Section 4.07. Restricted Payments. The Company shall not and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company's Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment to holders of the Company's Equity Interests in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company's Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company); (ii) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Company or any direct or indirect parent or other Affiliate of the Company that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; (iii) make any principal payment on, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness that is subordinated to the Notes, except at final maturity; or (iv) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above being collectively 37

Morgan Trust Company, National Association as successor trustee to Bank One, National Association, plus (ii) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as one accounting period) from the beginning of the first fiscal quarter commencing prior to the date of this Indenture to the end of the Company's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus (iii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issue and sale since the date of this Indenture of Equity Interests in the Company or of debt securities of the Company that have been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or convertible debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Company and other than Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock), plus (iv) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the date of this Indenture is sold for cash or otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash, the lesser of (A) the net proceeds of such sale, liquidation or repayment and (B) the initial amount of such Restricted Investment. The foregoing provisions shall not prohibit (1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at said date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of this Indenture; (2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of any Equity Interests of the Company in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of other Equity Interests of the Company (other than any Disqualified Stock); provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition shall be excluded from clause (c) (ii) of the preceding paragraph; (3) the defeasance, redemption or repurchase of Subordinated Indebtedness with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of subordinated Permitted Refinancing Debt or the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock); provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition shall be excluded from clause (c) (ii) of the preceding paragraph; (4) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or 38
retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company held by any of the Company's (or any of its Subsidiaries') employees pursuant to any management equity subscription agreement or stock option agreement in effect as of the date of this Indenture; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests shall not exceed $2.0 million in any twelve-month period; and provided further that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately after such transaction; (5) repurchases of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options if such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of such options; and (6) cash payments made by the Company for the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement of the Company's 7 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013. The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value (as determined in good faith by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, which determination shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with this provision) on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) proposed to be transferred by the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. Not later than five days after the date of making any Restricted Payment, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such Restricted Payment is permitted and setting forth the basis upon which the calculations required by this Section 4.07 were computed. In computing Consolidated Net Income for purposes of this Section 4.07, (i) the Company shall use audited financial statements for the portion of the relevant period for which audited financial statements are available on the date of determination and unaudited financial statements and other current financial data based on the books and records of the Company for the remaining portion of such period and (ii) the Company shall be permitted to rely in good faith on the financial statements and other financial data derived from the books and records of the Company that are available on the date of determination. If the Company makes a Restricted Payment which, at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment, would on the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the requirements of this Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with this Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Company's financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income of the Company for any period. The Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if such designation would not cause a Default. For purposes of making such determination, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated shall be deemed to be Restricted Payments at the time of such designation and shall reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant. All such outstanding Investments shall be deemed to constitute Investments in an amount equal to the greater of the fair market value or the book value of such Investments at the time of such designation. Such designation shall only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. 39
Section 4.08. Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (i) (x) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (1) on its Capital Stock or (2) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (y) pay any indebtedness owed by it to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (iii) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (a) the Credit Agreement as in effect as of the date of this Indenture, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings thereof or any other Credit Facility, provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements, refinancings or any other Credit Facilities are no more restrictive taken as a whole with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the Credit Agreement as in effect on the date of this Indenture, (b) this Indenture and the Notes, (c) applicable law, (d) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except, in the case of Indebtedness, to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired, provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of this Indenture to be incurred, (e) by reason of customary non-assignment provisions in leases and customary provisions in other agreements that restrict assignment of such agreements or rights thereunder, entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices, (f) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the nature described in clause (iii) above on the property so acquired or (g) Permitted Refinancing Debt, provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Debt are no more restrictive than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced. Section 4.09. Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and the Company shall not issue any Disqualified Stock and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock if: (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified 40
Stock is issued would have been at least 2.5 to 1, determined on a pro forma basis as set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio; and (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock is issued or would occur as a consequence of the incurrence of the additional Indebtedness or the issuance of the Disqualified Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Indenture shall not prohibit any of the following (collectively, "Permitted Indebtedness"): (a) the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes; (b) the Indebtedness evidenced by the 7 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes; (c) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness pursuant to Credit Facilities, so long as the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness outstanding under all Credit Facilities does not, at any one time, exceed the greater of (1) $600.0 million (or, if there is any permanent reduction in the aggregate principal amount permitted to be borrowed under the Credit Agreement, such lesser aggregate principal amount) and (2) an amount equal to the sum of (x) $50 million plus (y) 30% of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets determined after the incurrence of such Indebtedness (including the application of the proceeds therefrom), (d) the guarantee by any Subsidiary Guarantor of any Indebtedness that is permitted by this Indenture to be incurred by the Company; (e) all Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in existence as of the date of this Indenture; (f) intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (1) if the Company is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness is expressly subordinate to the payment in full of all Obligations with respect to the Notes and (2) (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary and (B) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be; (g) Indebtedness in connection with one or more standby letters of credit, guarantees, performance bonds or other reimbursement obligations, in each case, issued in the ordinary course of business and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit (other than advances or credit on open account, includible in current liabilities, for goods and services in the ordinary course of business and on terms and conditions which are customary in the Oil and Gas Business, and other than the extension of credit represented by such letter of credit guarantee or performance bond itself), not to exceed in the aggregate at any given time 5.0% of Total Assets; (h) Indebtedness under Interest Rate Hedging Agreements entered into for the purpose of limiting interest rate risks, provided that the obligations under such agreements are related to payment obligations on Indebtedness otherwise permitted by the terms of this covenant and that the aggregate notional principal amount of such agreements does not exceed 105% of the principal amount of the Indebtedness to which such agreements relate; (i) Indebtedness under Oil and Gas Hedging Contracts, provided that such contracts were entered into in the ordinary course of business for the purpose of limiting risks that arise in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries; (j) the incurrence by the Company of Indebtedness not otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to this paragraph, provided that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of all Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (i), together with all Permitted Refinancing Debt incurred pursuant to clause (k) of this 41
paragraph in respect of Indebtedness previously incurred pursuant to this clause (i), does not exceed $10.0 million at any one time outstanding; (k) Permitted Refinancing Debt incurred in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refinance, extend, renew, replace, defease or refund, Indebtedness that was permitted by this Indenture to be incurred (including Indebtedness previously incurred pursuant to this clause (k)); (l) accounts payable or other obligations of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to trade creditors created or assumed by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business in connection with the obtaining of goods or services; (m) Indebtedness consisting of obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments, guarantees or indemnities in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets; and (n) production imbalances that do not, at any one time outstanding, exceed 2% of the Total Assets of the Company. The Company shall not permit any of its Unrestricted Subsidiary to incur any Indebtedness other than Non-Recourse Debt; provided, however, if any such Indebtedness ceases to be Non-Recourse Debt, such event shall be deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company. Section 4.10. Asset Sales. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in an Asset Sale unless (i) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company set forth in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee, which determination shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with this provision) of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of and (ii) at least 85% of the consideration therefor received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale, plus all other Asset Sales since the date of this Indenture, on a cumulative basis, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of any liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet), of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any guarantee thereof) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability. Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company may apply such Net Proceeds, at its option: (a) to reduce Senior Debt, (b) to acquire controlling interests in another Oil and Gas Business, (c) to make capital expenditures in respect of the Company's or its Restricted Subsidiaries' Oil and Gas Business, (d) to purchase long-term assets that are used or useful in such Oil and Gas Business or (e) to repurchase any Notes. Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce Senior Debt that is revolving debt or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph shall (after the expiration of the periods specified in this paragraph) be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 million, the Company shall make an Asset Sale Offer to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any 42
other pari passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Sale Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to, in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase or, in the case of any other pari passu Indebtedness, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or with respect to discount pari passu Indebtedness, the accreted value thereof) on the date of purchase, in each case, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.09 hereof or the agreements governing pari passu Indebtedness, as applicable. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as the case may be) of the Notes and pari passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof, and (ii) the aggregate principal amount or accreted value, as the case may be, of other pari passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders thereof, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee and the trustee or other lender representatives for the pari passu Indebtedness shall select the Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) thereof surrendered in such Asset Sale Offer. Upon completion of such Asset Sale Offer, the Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Section 4.11. Transactions with Affiliates. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any of its Affiliates (each of the foregoing, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless (i) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Subsidiary with an unrelated Person and (ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee (a) with respect to an Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $1,000,000 but less than or equal to $5,000,000, an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (i) above, (b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $5,000,000 but less than or equal to $10,000,000, a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions complies with clause (i) above and that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions has been approved in good faith by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company who are disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions (which resolution shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with this provision) and (c) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $10,000,000, a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions complies with clause (i) above and that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions has been approved in good faith by a resolution adopted by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company who are disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions and an opinion as to the fairness to the Company or such 43
Subsidiary of such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal, engineering or investment banking firm of national standing (which resolution and fairness opinion shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with this provision); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (l) transactions contemplated by any employment agreement or other compensation plan or arrangement entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the past practice of the Company or such Subsidiary, (2) transactions between or among the Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries, (3) Permitted Investments and Restricted Payments that are permitted by Section 4.07 hereof, and (4) any indemnification payment made to any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to charter, bylaw, statutory or contractual provisions.

Section 4.13. Offer to Repurchase Upon Change of Control. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder of the Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any, thereon to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder stating: (1) a description of the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (2) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.13 and that all Notes tendered shall be accepted for payment; (3) the purchase price and the purchase date described below (the "Change of Control Payment Date"); (4) that any Note not tendered shall continue to accrue interest, if any; (5) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest, if any, after the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (7) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Notes purchased; and (8) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased 44
portion must be equal to $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof. The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall comply with the requirements of Rule l4e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable to such party in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. (b) On a Business Day that is no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date that the Company mails or causes to be mailed notice of the Change of Control to the Holders (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (i) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all the Notes or portions thereof so tendered and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of such Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of the Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note shall be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The Change of Control provisions described above shall be applicable whether or not any other provisions of this Indenture are applicable. The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.13 and purchases all Notes (or portions thereof) validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Section 4.14. Additional Subsidiary Guarantees. In the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall acquire or create a Restricted Subsidiary after the date of this Indenture, such newly acquired or created Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to make the guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 and the Company shall cause such Subsidiary to evidence such guarantee in the manner set forth in Section 11.02; provided that, in no event shall any non-U.S. Subsidiary of the Company be deemed to make such guarantee or be required to execute a Guarantee in accordance with Section 11.02.

statutory), licenses and franchises of the Company and the Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company and the Subsidiaries shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of the Subsidiaries, if the Board of Directors of the relevant Person shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes. Section 4.16. No Senior Subordinated Debt. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.09 hereof, (i) the Company shall not incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to any Senior Debt of the Company and senior in any respect in right of payment to the Notes and (ii) the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not directly or indirectly incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness that is subordinate or junior in right of payment to Senior Debt of the Company and senior in any respect in right of payment to the Guarantees; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to distinctions between categories of Indebtedness that exist by reason of any Liens arising or created in respect of some but not all such Indebtedness. Section 4.17. Business Activities. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any material respect in any business other than the Oil and Gas Business.

Indebtedness not previously an obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiary which becomes the obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiary as a result of such transaction or series of transactions as having been incurred at the time of such transaction or series of transactions), the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Entity (if the Company is not the continuing obligor under this Indenture) is equal to of greater than the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions and (v) the Company or Surviving Entity (if the Company is not the continuing obligor under this Indenture) will, at the time of such transaction or series of transactions and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such transaction or series of transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of Section 4.09 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (iv) and (v), any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company, and any Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary. Section 5.02. Successor Corporation Substituted. Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 5.01 hereof, the Surviving Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition, the provisions of this Indenture referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to the Surviving Entity and not to the Company), and may exercise every right and power of the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein; provided, however, that the predecessor Company shall not be relieved from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes except in the case of a sale of all of the Company's assets that meets the requirements of Section 5.01 hereof. ARTICLE 6 DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Section 6.01. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs if: (1) the Company defaults in the payment of interest (including any interest payable as Liquidated Damages), if any, on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable and the Default continues for a period of 30 days, whether or not such payment is prohibited by the provisions of Article 10 hereof; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes, whether or not such payment is prohibited by the provisions of Article 10 hereof; 47
(3) the Company fails to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement on the part of the Company to be observed or performed pursuant to Article 5 hereof; (4) the Company fails to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement on the part of the Company to be observed or performed pursuant to Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16 and 4.17 hereof and the Default continues for the period and after the notice specified below; (5) the Company fails to comply with any of its other agreements or covenants in, or provisions of, the Notes or this Indenture and the Default continues for consecutive days after the notice specified below; (6) except as permitted herein, any Guarantee shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or a Subsidiary Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of a Subsidiary Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligation under its Guarantee; (7) a default occurs under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or shall be created hereafter, which default (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default") or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there is then existing a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $10 million or more; provided, that if any such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration rescinded, or such Indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 10 days from the continuation of such default beyond the applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such Event of Default under this Indenture and any consequential acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded; (8) a final non-appealable judgment or order or final non-appealable judgments or orders are rendered against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that remain unpaid or discharged for a period of 60 days and that require the payment of money, either individually or in an aggregate amount, in excess of $10 million; (9) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: (a) a commences a voluntary case or proceeding, 48
(b) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding, (c) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property or (d) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (10) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (a) is for relief against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, in an involuntary case or proceeding, (b) appoints a Custodian of the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or for all or substantially all of the property of the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or (c) orders the liquidation of the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, and in each case the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. A Default under clause (4) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes notify the Company and the Trustee, of the Default and the Company does not cure the Default within 30 consecutive days after receipt of the notice. A Default under clause (5) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes notify the Company and the Trustee, of the Default and the Company does not cure the Default within 60 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default." Section 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (9) and (10) of Section 6.01 hereof) relating to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the unpaid principal amount of and any accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company or the Trustee shall notify the holders of Designated Senior Debt of such 49
acceleration. Upon such declaration the principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that so long as any Designated Senior Debt or any commitment therefor is outstanding, any such notice or declaration shall not become effective until the earlier of (a) five Business Days after such notice is delivered to the representative for the Designated Senior Debt or (b) the acceleration of any Designated Senior Debt and thereafter, payments on the Notes pursuant to this Article 6 shall be made only to the extent permitted pursuant to Article 10 herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Event of Default specified in clause (9) or (10) of Section 6.01 hereof relating to the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary occurs, such an amount shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act or notice on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. After a declaration of acceleration under this Indenture, but before a judgment or decree for payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes due under this Article 6 has been obtained by the Trustee, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (i) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (a) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under this Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and (b) all overdue interest on the Notes, if any, (ii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (iii) all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived. Section 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. Section 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium and liquidated damages, if any, or interest on, the Notes (including in connection with an offer to purchase) (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration). Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this 50
Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 6.05. Control by Majority. Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability it being understood that (subject to Section 7.01) the Trustee shall have no duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such holders. Section 6.06. Limitation on Suits. A Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if: (a) the Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default; (b) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (c) such Holder of a Note or Holders of Notes offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the provision of indemnity; and (e) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request. A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note. Section 6.07. Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. Section 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust 51
against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor for the whole amount of principal of, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. Section 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and may be a member of the creditors' committee. Section 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article, it shall, subject to the provisions of Article 10, pay out the money in the following order: First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Sections 6.08 and 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection; Second: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, as the case may be, respectively; and 52
Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10. Section 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. Article 7 TRUSTEE Section 7.01. Duties of Trustee.

Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders of the Notes. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, provided all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07 hereof.

For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal,. of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust fund described in Section 8.04 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such Section, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 and Section 4.02 hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article 8.

For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the 59
Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture, such Notes and such Guarantees shall be unaffected thereby.

Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. Section 9.02. With Consent of Holders of Notes. Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes). Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), no waiver or amendment to this Indenture may make any change in the provisions of Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.13 hereof that adversely affect the rights of any Holder of Notes. In addition, any amendment to the provisions of Article 10 of this Indenture shall require the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding if such amendment would adversely affect the rights of Holders of Notes; provided that, no amendment may be made to the provisions of Article 10 of this Indenture that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Debt (or any group or representative thereof authorized to consent) consent to such change. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by the 63
Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder): (a) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (except as provided above with respect to Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.13 hereof); (c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note; (d) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); (e) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes; (f) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes; or (g) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions. Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver. 64
Section 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in an amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect. Section 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder. Section 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Notes. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver. Section 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendment, etc. The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor may sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until its respective Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and that there has been compliance with all conditions precedent.

Section 10.02. Certain Definitions. "Bankruptcy Law" means the Bankruptcy Code or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. "Representative" means the indenture trustee or other trustee, agent or representative for any Senior Debt. "Senior Debt" means (i) Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company under or in respect of any Credit Facility, whether for principal, interest (including interest accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any proceeding pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law, whether or not the claim for such interest is allowed as a claim in such proceeding), reimbursement obligations, fees, commissions, expenses, indemnities or other amounts and (ii) any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company permitted under the terms of this Indenture, unless the instrument under which such Indebtedness is incurred expressly provides that it is on a parity with or subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.

Section 10.03. Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy. (a) Upon any payment or distribution of property or securities to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, or in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshalling of the Company's assets and liabilities: (1) the holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations in respect of such Senior Debt (including 66
interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt, whether or not a claim for such interest would be allowed in such proceeding) before the Holders of Notes shall be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the Notes and related Obligations (except in each case that Holders of Notes may receive securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Notes to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof provided that the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture); and (2) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of the Company (as provided in subsection (1) above) are paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which the Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees would be entitled shall be made to holders of Senior Debt of the Company (except that Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees may receive securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Notes to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof provided that the, applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture). (b) Upon any payment or distribution of property or securities to creditors of a Subsidiary Guarantor in a liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property, or in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshalling of such Subsidiary Guarantor's assets and liabilities: (1) the holders of Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations in respect of such Senior Debt (including interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt, whether or not a claim for such interest would be allowed in such proceeding) before the Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees shall be entitled to receive any payment or distribution with respect to the Guarantee made by such Subsidiary Guarantor (except in each case that Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees may receive securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Notes to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof provided that the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture); and (2) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor (as provided in subsection (1) above) are paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which the Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees would be entitled shall be made to holders of Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor (except that Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees may receive securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Notes to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof provided that the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture). 67
Under the circumstances described in this Section 10.03, the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar person making any payment or distribution of cash or other property or securities is authorized or instructed to make any payment or distribution to which the Holders of the Notes and the related Guarantees would otherwise be entitled (other than securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Notes to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust referred to in the second parenthetical clause of each of clauses (a)(1), (b)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2) above, which shall be delivered or paid to the Holders of Notes as set forth in such clauses) directly to the holders of the Senior Debt of the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Debt of the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, held by such holders) or their Representatives, or to any trustee or trustees under any other indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests appear, to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior Debt in full, in cash or cash equivalents after giving effect to any concurrent payment, distribution or provision thereof or to or for the holders of such Senior Debt. To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Debt (whether by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Debt or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. To the extent the obligation to repay any Senior Debt is declared to be fraudulent, invalid or otherwise set aside under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then the obligation so declared fraudulent, invalid or otherwise set aside (and all other amounts that would come due with respect thereto had such obligation not been so affected) shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as Senior Debt for all purposes hereof as if such declaration, invalidity or setting aside had not occurred. Section 10.04. Default on Designated Senior Debt. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors may not make any payment (whether by redemption, purchase, retirements, defeasance or otherwise) upon or in respect of the Notes and the related Guarantees (other than securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Notes to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments and other distributions made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof if the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture) until all principal and other Obligations with respect to the Senior Debt of the Company have been paid in full if: (i) a default in the payment of any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on Designated Senior Debt occurs; or (ii) any other default occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Debt that permits, or with the giving of notice or passage of time or both (unless 68
cured or waived) would permit, holders of the Designated Senior Debt as to which such default relates to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from the Company or the holders of any Designated Senior Debt. If the Trustee receives any such Payment Blockage Notice, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until 360 days shall have elapsed since the date of commencement of the payment blockage period resulting from the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No nonpayment default in respect of any Designated Senior Debt that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice. The Company shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Notes and any Subsidiary Guarantor shall resume making payments and distributions pursuant to the Guarantees upon: (1) in the case of a default referred to in Section 10.04(i) hereof the date upon which the default is cured or waived, or (2) in the case of a default referred to in Section 10.04(ii) hereof, the earliest of (1) the date on which such nonpayment default is cured or waived, (2) the date the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is retracted by written notice to the Trustee and (3) 90 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received unless (A) the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated or (B) a Default or Event of Default under Section 6.01(9) or (10) has occurred and is continuing, if this Article otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment or acquisition. Section 10.05. Acceleration of Notes. If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify holders of Senior Debt of the acceleration. Section 10.06. When Distribution Must be Paid Over. In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives any payment or distribution of or in respect of any Obligations with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees at a time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 10.03 or Section 10.04 hereof, such payment or distribution shall be held by the Trustee (if the Trustee has actual knowledge that such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 10.03 or Section 10.04) or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered to, the holders of Senior Debt as their interests may appear or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which such Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt. 69
With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and, except as provided in Section 10.12, shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders of Notes or the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee. Section 10.07. Notice by Company. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes or the related Guarantees to violate this Article, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Notes and the related Guarantees to the Senior Debt as provided in this Article. Section 10.08. Subrogation. After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness pari passu with the Notes and the Guarantees) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that distributions and payments otherwise payable to the Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt. A payment or distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees is not, as between the Company and Holders of Notes, a payment by the Company on the Notes. Section 10.09. Relative Rights. This Article defines the relative rights of Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees and holders of Senior Debt. Nothing in this Indenture shall: (1) impair, as between the Company and Holders of Notes, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms; (2) affect the relative rights of Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or (3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees. 70
If the Company fails because of this Article to pay principal of or interest on a Note on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default. Section 10.10. Subordination May Not be Impaired by Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors. No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as provided in this Article 10 will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of Senior Debt may have or otherwise be charged with. The provisions of this Article Ten are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of Senior Debt. Section 10.11. Payment, Distribution or Notice to Representative. Whenever a payment or distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative. Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes and the related Guarantees for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10. Section 10.12. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes and the Guarantees, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least one Business Day prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes or Guarantees to violate this Article, which notice shall specifically refer to Section 10.03 or 10.04 hereof. Only the Company or a Representative may give the notice. Nothing in this Article 10 shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. 71
Section 10.13. Authorization to Effect Subordination. Each Holder by the Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 6.09 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, each lender under the Credit Agreement is hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes and the related Guarantees. Section 10.14. Amendments. No amendment may be made to the provisions of or the definitions of any terms appearing in this Article 10, or to the provisions of Section 6.02 relating to the Designated Senior Debt, that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Debt (or any group or Representative authorized to give a consent) consent to such change. Section 10.15. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. Without in any way limiting the generality of Section 10.09 of this Indenture, the holders of Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring responsibility to the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article 10 or the obligations hereunder of the Holders to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding or secured; (b) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor and any other Person. Article 11 THE GUARANTEES Section 11.01. The Guarantees. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of and premium and interest, on the Notes shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on premium and interest, on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder shall be 72
promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, or any Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders of Notes in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors further agrees that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any Subsidiary Guarantor not paying so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantees. Section 11.02. Execution and Delivery of Guarantees. (i) To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit C shall be endorsed by an officer of such Subsidiary Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor by its President or one of its Vice Presidents and attested to by an Officer and that such Subsidiary Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that the foregoing have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Guarantee is a valid and legally binding obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, enforceable against such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with its terms. 73
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Guarantee. If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the applicable Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which such Guarantee is endorsed, such Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless. The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Subsidiary Guarantors. Section 11.03. Subsidiary Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms. No Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the Surviving Person) another Person, whether or not affiliated with such Subsidiary Guarantor, unless: (a) subject to the provisions of Section 11.04 hereof, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee in respect of the Notes, this Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee; (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and (c) such transaction does not violate any of Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16 and 4.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be permitted to consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), another corporation, Person or entity pursuant to the preceding sentence if such consolidation or merger would not be permitted by Section 5.01 hereof. In case of any such consolidation or merger and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by such Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for such Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. 74
Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of any Subsidiary Guarantor with or into the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of any Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor. Section 11.04. Releases of Guarantees. In the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor or a sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of any Subsidiary Guarantor, to any corporation or other Person (including an Unrestricted Subsidiary) by way of merger, consolidation, or otherwise, in a transaction that does not violate any of the covenants of this Indenture, then such Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all the capital stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall be released and relieved of any obligations under its Guarantee and such acquiring corporation or other Person (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor), if other than a Subsidiary Guarantor, shall have no obligation to assume or otherwise become liable under such Guarantee; provided, that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with Section 4.10 hereof. Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall ipso facto be released from its obligations under its Guarantee and the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee. Any Subsidiary Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Indenture as provided in this Article 11. Any Subsidiary Guarantor that is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Indenture shall be released from and relieved of its obligations under its Guarantee and any Unrestricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and any newly created or newly acquired Subsidiary that is or becomes a Subsidiary shall be required to execute a Guarantee in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Section 11.05. Limitation on Subsidiary Guarantor Liability. For purposes hereof, each Subsidiary Guarantor's liability shall be that amount from time to time equal to the aggregate liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor thereunder, but shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the Obligations of the Company under the Notes and this Indenture and (ii) the amount, if any, which would not have (A) rendered such Subsidiary Guarantor "insolvent" (as such term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code and in the Debtor and Creditor Law of the State of New York) or (B) left it with unreasonably small capital at the time its Guarantee of the Notes was entered into, after giving effect to the incurrence of existing Indebtedness immediately prior to such time; provided that, it shall be a presumption in any lawsuit or other proceeding in which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party that the amount 75
guaranteed pursuant to its Guarantee is the amount set forth in clause (i) above unless any creditor, or representative of creditors of such Subsidiary Guarantor, or debtor in possession or trustee in bankruptcy of such Subsidiary Guarantor, otherwise proves in such a lawsuit that the aggregate liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor is limited to the amount set forth in clause (ii). In making any determination as to the solvency or sufficiency of capital of a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the previous sentence, the right of such Subsidiary Guarantor to contribution from other Subsidiary Guarantors and any other rights such Subsidiary Guarantor may have, contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account. Section 11.06. "Trustee" to Include Paying Agent. In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in Article 10 and this Article 11 shall in such case (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully and for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in Article 10 and this Article 11 in place of the Trustee. Section 11.07. Subordination of Guarantees. The obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors under its Guarantee pursuant to this Article 11 shall be junior and subordinated to the Senior Debt of the Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article 10 hereof. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the Trustee and the Holders shall have the right to receive and/or retain payments or distributions by or on behalf of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors only at such times as they may receive and/or retain payments in respect of the Notes pursuant to this Indenture, including Article 10 hereof. Article 12 MISCELLANEOUS Section 12.01. Trust Indenture Act Controls. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by TIA Section 318(c), the imposed duties shall control. If any provisions of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the TIA that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case may be. Section 12.02. Notices. Any notice or communication by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors or the Trustee to the others is duly given if in writing and delivered, in Person or mailed by first class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telecopier or overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, to the others' address: If to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor: 76

If the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor mails a notice or communication to Holders, it shall mail a copy to the Trustee and each Agent at the same time. 77
Section 12.03. Communication by Holders of Notes with Other Holders of Notes. Holders may communicate pursuant to TIA Section 312(b) with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Notes. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of TIA Section 312(c) . Section 12.04. Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent. Upon any request or application by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Trustee to take any action under this Indenture, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Trustee: (a) an Officers' Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (which shall include the statements set forth in Section 12.05 hereof) stating that, in the opinion of the signers, all conditions precedent and covenants, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with; and (b) an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (which shall include the statements set forth in Section 12.05 hereof) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent and covenants have been complied with. Section 12.05. Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion. Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture (other than a certificate provided pursuant to TIA Section 314(a) (4)) shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 314(e) and shall include: (a) a statement that the Person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition; (b) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based; (c) a statement that, in the opinion of such Person, he or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (d) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such Person, such condition or covenant has been complied with. Section 12.06. Rules by Trustee and Agents. The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or at a meeting of Holders. The Registrar or Paying Agent may make reasonable rules and set reasonable requirements for its functions. 78
Section 12.07. No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders. No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.

The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note on each interest payment date, as set forth on the face of this Note, at the rate of 6 3/8% per annum [(subject to adjustment as provided below)].(1) Interest will be payable semiannually (to the holders of record of the Notes at the close of business on the March 1 or September 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date) on each interest payment date, commencing September 15, 2005.(2) [The Holder of this Note is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement, dated March 9, 2005, between the Company and the Initial Purchasers named therein (the "REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT"). In the event that (i) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is not declared effective on or prior to the 180th day following the Closing Date (the "EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE") or, if that day is not a Business Day, the next day that is a Business Day, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated on or prior to the earlier of the 30th Business Day following the date the Exchange Offer Registration Statement was declared effective or the 210th day following the Closing Date, or, if that day is not a Business Day, the next day that is a Business Day, or (iii) the Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) is required to be filed but is not declared effective by the later of 180 calendar days after the Closing Date or 90 days after the Shelf Registration Statement is required to be filed with the Commission, or, if either such day is not a Business Day, the next day that is a Business Day, or is declared effective by such date but thereafter ceases to be effective or usable, except if the Shelf Registration Statement or the Exchange Offer Registration Statement ceases to be effective or usable as specifically permitted by the penultimate paragraph of Section 5 of the Registration Rights Agreement (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) a "REGISTRATION DEFAULT"), liquidated damages in the form of additional cash interest ("LIQUIDATED DAMAGES") will accrue on the affected Notes and the affected Exchange Notes, as applicable, as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement.

At least 15 days before a special record date, the Company will send to each Holder and to the Trustee a notice that sets forth the special record date, the payment date and the amount of interest to be paid. 2. Indenture. This is one of the Notes issued under an Indenture dated as of March 9, 2005 (as amended from time to time, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee. Capitalized terms used herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Note and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture will control. The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Indenture limits the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes to $150,000,000, but Additional Notes may be issued pursuant to the Indenture, and the originally issued Notes and all such Additional Notes vote together for all purposes as a single class. 3. Optional Redemption. (a) The Notes are not redeemable at the Company's option prior to March 15, 2010. From and after March 15, 2010, the Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the - ---------- (2) Include only for Initial Note or Initial Additional Note. (3) Include only for Exchange Note. (4) For Additional Notes, should be the date of their original issue. A-5
Company, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 15 of the years indicated below: (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this paragraph 3, prior to March 15, 2008 the Company may, at its option, on any one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.375% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, with the net proceeds of sales of public Equity Interests of the Company; provided that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and provided, further, that any such redemption shall occur within 60 days after the date of the closing of the related sale of such Equity Interests. 4. Mandatory Redemption. Except as set forth in paragraph 5 below, the Company shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. 5. Repurchase at Option of Holder. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). The right of the Holders of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase such Notes upon a Change of Control may not be waived by the Trustee without the approval of the Holders of the Notes required by Section 9.02 of the Indenture. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Change of Control Payment shall be made on a Business Day not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after such notice is mailed. The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. (b) If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary consummates any Asset Sales permitted by the Indenture, when the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $10.0 A-6
million, the Company shall make an Asset Sale Offer to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any other pari passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Sale Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to, in the case of the Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase or, in the case of any pari passu Indebtedness, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or with respect to discount pari passu Indebtedness, the accreted value thereof) on the date of purchase, in each case, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.09 of the Indenture or the agreements governing the pari passu Indebtedness, as applicable. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as the case may be) of Notes and pari passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof and (ii) the aggregate principal amount or accreted value, as the case may be, of pari passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee and the trustee or other lender representative for the pari passu Indebtedness shall select the Notes and the other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) thereof surrendered in such Asset Sale Offer. Upon completion of such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. 6. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be redeemed. On and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the aggregate principal amount of the Notes called for redemption. 7. Registered Form; Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register the transfer or exchange of Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. Pursuant to the Indenture, there are certain periods during which the Trustee will not be required to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Note or certain portions of a Note. 8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of a Note shall be treated as its owner for all purposes. 9. Amendment, Supplement and Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or the tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default under, or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. Without the consent of any Holder of A-7
a Note, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended on supplemented to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder, or to comply with the requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. 10. Defaults and Remedies. Events of Default include: (i) default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes (whether or not prohibited by the provisions of Article 10 of the Indenture); (ii) default in payment when due of the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes (whether or not prohibited by the provisions of Article 10 of the Indenture); (iii) failure by the Company to comply with the provisions of Article 5 of the Indenture; (iv) failure by the Company for 30 consecutive days after notice from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to comply with the provisions of Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16 and 4.17 of the Indenture; (v) failure by the Company for 60 consecutive days after notice from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to comply with any of its other agreements or covenants in, or provisions of, this Note or in the Indenture; (vi) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Guarantee shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or a Subsidiary Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of a Subsidiary Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under its Guarantee; (vii) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the Indenture, which default (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default") or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there is then existing a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $10.0 million or more; provided, that if any such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration rescinded, or such Indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 10 days from the continuation of such default beyond the applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such Event of Default under the Indenture and any consequential acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded; (viii) a final non-appealable judgment or order or final non-appealable judgments or orders are rendered against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that remain unpaid or discharged for a period of 60 days and that require the payment in money, either individually or in an aggregate amount, that is more than $10.0 million; and (ix) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary. If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (ix) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding. the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising A-8
from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within 5 Business days after becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default. 11. Subordination. The Notes are subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Debt must be paid before the Notes may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, and any other payment Obligation of the Company in respect of the Notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt of the Company (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed) and authorizes the Trustee to give effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose. 12. Trustee Dealings with Company. The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue or resign. 13. No Recourse Against Others. No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. 14. Authentication. This Note is not valid until the Trustee (or Authenticating Agent) signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note. A-9
15. Governing Law. This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 16. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian) and U/G/M/A/ (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).

Upon the Exchange Offer Registration Statement being declared effective by the Commission, the Issuer will offer the Exchange Notes in exchange for surrender of the Notes. The Issuer shall keep the Exchange Offer open for not
-5- less than 30 days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the Exchange Offer is mailed to Holders. Each Holder that participates in the Exchange Offer will be required to represent to the Issuer in writing that (i) any Exchange Notes to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) it has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Exchange Notes in violation of the provisions of the Securities Act or, if it is an affiliate, it will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable, (iii) it is not an affiliate of the Issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, a distribution of Exchange Notes, (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Notes for its own account in exchange for Notes that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities, it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Notes and (vi) such Holder has full power and authority to transfer the Notes in exchange for the Exchange Notes and that the Issuer will acquire good and unencumbered title thereto free and clear of any liens, restrictions, charges or encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims. (b) The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers acknowledge that the staff of the Commission has taken the position that any broker-dealer that elects to exchange Notes that were acquired by such broker-dealer for its own account as a result of market-making or other trading activities for Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offer (a "Participating Broker-Dealer") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Notes (other than a resale of an unsold allotment resulting from the original offering of the Notes). The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers also acknowledge that the staff of the Commission has taken the position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Notes, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Notes owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligations under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Notes for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act. In light of the foregoing, if requested by a Participating Broker-Dealer (a "Requesting Participating Broker-Dealer"), the Issuer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective for a period not to exceed 180 days after the date on which the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective, or such longer period if extended pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 5 hereof (such period, the "Applicable Period"), or such earlier date as all Requesting Participating Broker-Dealers shall have notified the Issuer in writing that such Requesting Participating Broker-Dealers have resold all Exchange Notes acquired in the Exchange Offer. The Issuer shall include a plan of distribution in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement that meets the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph.
-6- If, prior to consummation of the Exchange Offer, any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, as the case may be, holds any Notes acquired by it that have, or that are reasonably likely to be determined to have, the status of an unsold allotment in an initial distribution, or if any Holder is not entitled to participate in the Exchange Offer, the Issuer upon the request of the Initial Purchasers or any such Holder, as the case may be, shall simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offer, issue and deliver to the Initial Purchasers or any such Holder, as the case may be, in exchange (the "Private Exchange") for such Notes held by the Initial Purchasers or any such Holder, as the case may be, a like principal amount of notes (the "Private Exchange Notes") of the Issuer that are identical in all material respects to the Exchange Notes except that the Private Exchange Notes may be subject to restrictions on transfer and bear a legend to such effect. The Private Exchange Notes shall be issued pursuant to the same indenture as the Exchange Notes and bear the same CUSIP number as the Exchange Notes. For each Note surrendered in the Exchange Offer, the Holder will receive an Exchange Note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered Note. Interest on each Exchange Note and Private Exchange Note issued pursuant to the Exchange Offer and in the Private Exchange will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Notes surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Notes, from the Issue Date. Upon consummation of the Exchange Offer in accordance with this Section 2, the Issuer shall have no further registration obligations other than the Issuer's continuing registration obligations with respect to (i) Private Exchange Notes, (ii) Exchange Notes held by Participating Broker-Dealers and (iii) Notes or Exchange Notes as to which clause (c)(iii) of this Section 2 applies. In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Issuer shall: (1) mail or cause to be mailed to each Holder entitled to participate in the Exchange Offer a copy of the Prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents; (2) utilize the services of a depositary for the Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York; (3) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Notes at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last Business Day on which the Exchange Offer shall remain open; and (4) otherwise comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange, if any, the Issuer shall: (1) accept for exchange all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by the Holders pursuant to the Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange, if any;
-7- (2) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation all Notes so accepted for exchange; and (3) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each such Holder of Notes, Exchange Notes or Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Registrable Notes of such Holder so accepted for exchange. The Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that (i) the Exchange Offer or Private Exchange, as the case may be, does not violate applicable law or any applicable interpretation of the staff of the Commission, (ii) no action or proceeding shall have been instituted or threatened in any court or by any governmental agency which might materially impair the ability of the Issuer to proceed with the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, and no material adverse development shall have occurred in any existing action or proceeding with respect to the Issuer and (iii) all governmental approvals shall have been obtained, which approvals the Issuer deems necessary for the consummation of the Exchange Offer or Private Exchange. The Exchange Notes and the Private Exchange Notes shall be issued under (i) the Indenture or (ii) an indenture identical in all material respects to the Indenture (in either case, with such changes as are necessary to comply with any requirements of the Commission to effect or maintain the qualification thereof under the TIA) and which, in either case, has been qualified under the TIA and shall provide that (a) the Exchange Notes shall not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and (b) the Private Exchange Notes shall be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture. The Exchange Notes and the Private Exchange Notes will be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors to the same extent as the Notes. The Indenture or such indenture shall provide that the Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes and the Notes shall vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Exchange Notes, the Private Exchange Notes or the Notes will have the right to vote or consent as a separate class on any matter. The Issuer will cause the Subsidiary Guarantors to become co-registrants under the Exchange Offer Registration Statement with respect to the Guarantees. (c) In the event that (i) any changes in law or the applicable interpretations of the staff of the Commission do not permit the Issuer to effect the Exchange Offer, (ii) for any reason the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 210 days of the Issue Date, (iii) any Holder, other than the Initial Purchasers, notifies the Issuer prior to the 20th Business Day following the consummation of the Exchange Offer that it is prohibited by law or the applicable interpretations of the staff of the Commission from participating in the Exchange Offer, (iv) in the case of any Holder who participates in the Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive Exchange Notes on the date of the exchange that may be sold without restriction under state and federal securities laws (other than due solely to the status of such holder as an affiliate of the Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act) or (v) the Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to Notes or Private Exchange Notes that have, or that are reasonably likely to be determined to have, the status of unsold allotments in an initial distribution (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of this sentence, a "Shelf Filing Event"), then the Issuer shall file a Shelf Registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof.
-8- Section 3. Shelf Registration. If at any time a Shelf Filing Event shall occur, then: (a) Shelf Registration. The Issuer shall file with the Commission a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Notes not exchanged in the Exchange Offer, Private Exchange Notes and Exchange Notes as to which Section 2(c)(iii) is applicable (the "Shelf Registration"). The Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission the Shelf Registration as promptly as practicable. The Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-3 or another appropriate form permitting registration of such Registrable Notes for resale by Holders in the manner or manners designated by them (including, without limitation, one or more underwritten offerings). The Issuer shall not permit any securities other than the Registrable Notes to be included in the Shelf Registration. The Issuer will cause the Subsidiary Guarantors to become co-registrants under the Shelf Registration Statement with respect to the Guarantees. (b) The Issuer shall use its reasonable best efforts (x) to cause the Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the Securities Act on or prior to the later of 180 calendar days after the Issue Date or 90 days after the Shelf Registration is required to be filed with the Commission and (y) to keep the Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities Act for the period ending on the date which is two years from the Issue Date, subject to extension pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 5 hereof (the "Effectiveness Period"), or such shorter period ending when all Registrable Notes covered by the Shelf Registration have been sold in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Shelf Registration; provided, however, that (i) the Effectiveness Period in respect of the Shelf Registration shall be extended to the extent required to permit dealers to comply with the applicable prospectus delivery requirements of Rule 174 under the Securities Act and as otherwise provided herein and (ii) the Issuer may suspend the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement by written notice to the Holders (A) as a result of the filing of a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Issuer where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related Prospectus or (B) for any purpose and for so long as permitted pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 5 hereof, including a bona fide business purpose. (c) Supplements and Amendments. The Issuer agrees to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement as and when required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration, or if reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement or by any underwriter of such Registrable Notes. Section 4. Liquidated Damages. (a) The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers agree that the Holders will suffer damages if the Issuer fails to fulfill its obligations under Section 2 or Section 3 hereof and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision. Accordingly, the Issuer agrees that if:
-9- (i) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to the 180th day following the Issue Date (the "Effectiveness Deadline") or, if that day is not a Business Day, the next day that is a Business Day, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated on or prior to the earlier of the 30th Business Day following the Effectiveness Deadline or the 210th day following the Issue Date, or, if that day is not a Business Day, the next day that is a Business Day; or (iii) the Shelf Registration Statement is required to be filed but is not declared effective by the later of 180 calendar days after the Issue Date or 90 days after the Shelf Registration is required to be filed with the Commission, or, if either such day is not a Business Day, the next day that is a Business Day, or is declared effective by such date but thereafter ceases to be effective or usable, except if the Shelf Registration ceases to be effective or usable as specifically permitted by the penultimate paragraph of Section 5 hereof (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) a "Registration Default"), liquidated damages in the form of additional cash interest ("Liquidated Damages") will accrue on the affected Notes and the affected Exchange Notes, as applicable. The rate of Liquidated Damages will be 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of a Registration Default, increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum amount of additional interest of 0.50% per annum, from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to, but excluding, the earlier of (1) the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured or (2) the date on which all the Notes and Exchange Notes otherwise become freely transferable by Holders other than affiliates of the Issuer without further registration under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the amount of Liquidated Damages payable shall not increase because more than one Registration Default has occurred and is pending and (2) a Holder of Notes or Exchange Notes who is not entitled to the benefits of the Shelf Registration Statement (i.e., such Holder has not elected to include information) shall not be entitled to Liquidated Damages with respect to a Registration Default that pertains to the Shelf Registration Statement. (b) So long as Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee within five Business Days after each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which Liquidated Damages is required to be paid. Any amounts of Liquidated Damages due pursuant to clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of this Section 4 will be payable in cash semi-annually on each January 15 and July 15 (each a "Damages Payment Date"), commencing with the first such date occurring after any such Liquidated Damages commence to accrue, to Holders to whom regular interest is payable on such Damages Payment Date with respect to Notes that are Registrable Securities. The amount of Liquidated Damages for Registrable Notes will be determined by multiplying the applicable rate of Liquidated Damages by the aggregate principal amount of all such Registrable Notes outstanding on the Damages Payment Date following such Registration Default in the case of the first such payment of Liquidated Damages with respect to a Registration Default (and thereafter at the next succeeding Damages Payment Date until the cure of such Registration Default), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Liquidated Damages rate was applicable during such
-10- period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and, in the case of a partial month, the actual number of days elapsed), and the denominator of which is 360. Section 5. Registration Procedures. In connection with the filing of any Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2 or 3 hereof, the Issuer shall effect such registrations to permit the sale of the securities covered thereby in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto and in connection with any Registration Statement filed by the Issuer hereunder, the Issuer shall: (a) Prepare and file with the Commission the Registration Statement or Registration Statements prescribed by Section 2 or 3 hereof, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that if (1) such filing is pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period relating thereto, before filing any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Issuer shall furnish to and afford the Holders of the Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, its counsel (if such counsel is known to the Issuer) and the managing underwriters, if any, a reasonable opportunity to review copies of all such documents (including copies of any documents to be incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto) proposed to be filed (in each case at least five Business Days prior to such filing or such later date as is reasonable under the circumstances). The Issuer shall not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto if the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement, or any such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, its counsel, or the managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object on a timely basis. (b) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Shelf Registration Statement or Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as the case may be, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective for the Effectiveness Period or the Applicable Period, as the case may be; cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any Prospectus supplement required by applicable law, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) promulgated under the Securities Act; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented and with respect to the subsequent resale of any securities being sold by a Participating Broker-Dealer covered by any such Prospectus, in each case, in accordance with the intended methods of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or Prospectus, as so amended.
-11- (c) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period relating thereto from whom the Issuer has received written notice that such Broker-Dealer will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the applicable Exchange Offer, notify the selling Holders of Registrable Notes, or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, their counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, as promptly as possible, and, if requested by any such Person, confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective under the Securities Act (including in such notice a written statement that any Holder may, upon request, obtain, at the sole expense of the Issuer, one conformed copy of such Registration Statement or post-effective amendment including financial statements and schedules, documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference and exhibits), (ii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if at any time when a Prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Registrable Notes or resales of Exchange Notes by Participating Broker-Dealers the representations and warranties of the Issuer contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by Section 5(m)(i) hereof cease to be true and correct in all material respects, (iv) of the receipt by the Issuer of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of a Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Notes or the Exchange Notes for offer or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the happening of any event, the existence of any condition or any information becoming known to the Issuer that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in or amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vi) of the Issuer's determination that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate. (d) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period, use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or suspending the qualification
-12- (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Notes or the Exchange Notes, as the case may be, for sale in any jurisdiction, and, if any such order is issued, to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest practicable moment. (e) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period and if reasonably requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters (if any), the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement or any Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, (i) promptly incorporate in such Registration Statement or Prospectus a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the managing underwriter or underwriters (if any), such Holders or any Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be (based upon advice of counsel), determine is reasonably necessary to be included therein and (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Issuer has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to take any action hereunder that would, in the written opinion of counsel to the Issuer, violate applicable laws. (f) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period, furnish to each selling Holder of Registrable Notes or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, who so requests, its counsel and each managing underwriter, if any, at the sole expense of the Issuer, one conformed copy of the Registration Statement or Registration Statements and each post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if requested, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits. (g) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period, deliver to each selling Holder of Registrable Notes or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, its respective counsel, and the underwriters, if any, at the sole expense of the Issuer, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of preliminary prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto and any documents incorporated by reference therein as such Persons may reasonably request; and, subject to the last paragraph of this Section 5, the Issuer hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders of Registrable Notes or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, and the underwriters or agents, if any, and dealers (if any), in
-13- connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Notes covered by, or the sale by Participating Broker-Dealers of the Exchange Notes pursuant to, such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto. (h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes or any delivery of a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify, and to cooperate with the selling Holders of Registrable Notes or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, and its respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes, as the case may be, for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as any selling Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer, or the managing underwriter or underwriters reasonably request; provided, however, that where Exchange Notes or Registrable Notes are offered other than through an underwritten offering, the Issuer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Issuer's counsel to perform Blue Sky investigations and file registrations and qualifications required to be filed pursuant to this Section 5(h); keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period such Registration Statement is required to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of such Exchange Notes or Registrable Notes covered by the applicable Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (B) take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or (C) subject itself to taxation in excess of a nominal dollar amount in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. (i) If a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, cooperate with the selling Holders of Registrable Notes and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Notes to be sold, which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends and shall be in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company and enable such Registrable Notes to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or selling Holders may request at least five Business Days prior to any sale of such Registrable Notes. (j) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes covered by any Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be reasonably necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriter or underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes, except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of such selling Holder's business, in which case the Issuer will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the filing of such Registration Statement and the granting of such approvals.
-14- (k) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 5(c)(v) or 5(c)(vi) hereof, as promptly as practicable prepare and (subject to Section 5(a) and the penultimate paragraph of this Section 5) file with the Commission, at the sole expense of the Issuer, a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Notes being sold thereunder or to the purchasers of the Exchange Notes to whom such Prospectus will be delivered by a Participating Broker-Dealer, any such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (l) Prior to the effective date of the first Registration Statement relating to the Registrable Notes, (i) provide the Trustee with certificates for the Registrable Notes in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company and (ii) provide a CUSIP number for the Registrable Notes. (m) In connection with any underwritten offering of Registrable Notes pursuant to a Shelf Registration, enter into an underwriting agreement as is customary in underwritten offerings of debt securities similar to the Notes and take all such other actions as are reasonably requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of such Registrable Notes and, in such connection, (i) make such representations and warranties to, and covenants with, the underwriters with respect to the business of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, as then conducted (including any acquired business, properties or entity, if applicable), and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, in each case, as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings of debt securities similar to the Notes, and confirm the same in writing if and when requested; (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written opinions of counsel to the Issuer and written updates thereof in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriter or underwriters, addressed to the underwriters covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters; (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriter or underwriters from the independent certified public accountants of the Issuer (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Issuer or of any business acquired by the Issuer for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), addressed to each of the underwriters, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort"
-15- letters in connection with underwritten offerings; and (iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered into, the same shall contain indemnification provisions and procedures no less favorable than those set forth in Section 7 hereof (or such other provisions and procedures acceptable to Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Registrable Notes covered by such Registration Statement and the managing underwriter or underwriters or agents) with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to said Section; provided that the Issuer shall not be required to provide indemnification to any underwriter selected in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 hereof with respect to information relating to such underwriter furnished in writing to the Issuer by or on behalf of such underwriter expressly for inclusion in such Registration Statement. The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting agreement, or as and to the extent required thereunder. (n) If (1) a Shelf Registration is filed pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (2) a Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2 hereof is required to be delivered under the Securities Act by any Participating Broker-Dealer who seeks to sell Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period, make available for inspection by any selling Holder of such Registrable Notes being sold or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, any underwriter participating in any such disposition of Registrable Notes, if any, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such selling Holder or each such Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, or underwriter (collectively, the "Inspectors"), at the offices where normally kept, during reasonable business hours, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and instruments of the Issuer and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Records") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise any applicable due diligence responsibilities, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the Issuer and its subsidiaries to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector in connection with such Registration Statement and Prospectus. Each Inspector shall agree in writing that it will keep the Records confidential and that it will not disclose, or use in connection with any market transactions in violation of any applicable securities laws, any Records that the Issuer determines, in good faith, to be confidential and that it notifies the Inspectors in writing are confidential unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such Registration Statement or Prospectus, (ii) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction, (iii) disclosure of such information is necessary or advisable in the opinion of counsel for an Inspector in connection with any action, claim, suit or proceeding, directly or indirectly, involving or potentially involving such Inspector and arising out of, based upon, relating to, or involving this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, or any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or arising hereunder or thereunder, or (iv) the information in such Records has been made generally available to the public; provided, however, that (i) each Inspector shall agree to use reasonable best efforts to provide notice to the Issuer of the potential disclosure of any information by such Inspector pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence to permit the Issuer to obtain a protective order (or waive the provisions of this paragraph (n)) and (ii) each such Inspector shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality of such information (if practicable)
-16- to the extent such action is otherwise not inconsistent with, an impairment of or in derogation of the rights and interests of the Holder or any Inspector. (o) Provide an indenture trustee for the Registrable Notes or the Exchange Notes, as the case may be, and cause the Indenture or the trust indenture provided for in Section 2(a) hereof to be qualified under the TIA not later than the effective date of the Exchange Offer or the first Registration Statement relating to the Registrable Notes; and in connection therewith, cooperate with the trustee under any such indenture and the Holders of the Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes, as applicable, to effect such changes to such indenture as may be required for such indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes, and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the Commission to enable such indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner. (p) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and make generally available to the Issuer's securityholders earnings statements satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or best efforts underwritten offering and (ii) if not sold to underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the first day of the first fiscal quarter of the Issuer after the effective date of a Registration Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods consistent with the requirements of Rule 158. (q) Upon the request of a Holder, upon consummation of the Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion of counsel to the Issuer, in a form customary for underwritten transactions, addressed to the Trustee for the benefit of all Holders of Registrable Notes participating in the Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, that the Exchange Notes or Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, and the related indenture constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its respective terms, subject to customary exceptions and qualifications. (r) If the Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Registrable Notes by Holders to the Issuer (or to such other Person as directed by the Issuer) in exchange for the Exchange Notes or the Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be, mark, or cause to be marked, on such Registrable Notes that such Registrable Notes are being cancelled in exchange for the Exchange Notes or the Private Exchange Notes, as the case may be; provided that in no event shall such Registrable Notes be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied. (s) Cooperate with each seller of Registrable Notes covered by any Registration Statement and each underwriter, if any, participating in the disposition of such Registrable
-17- Notes and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"). (t) Use its reasonable best efforts to take all other steps reasonably necessary or advisable to effect the registration of the Exchange Notes and/or Registrable Notes covered by a Registration Statement contemplated hereby. The Issuer may require each seller of Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Issuer such information regarding such seller and the distribution of such Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes as the Issuer may, from time to time, reasonably request. The Issuer may exclude from such registration the Registrable Notes of any seller so long as such seller fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request and in the event of such an exclusion, the Issuer shall have no further obligation under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the obligations under Section 4) with respect to such seller or any subsequent Holder of such Registrable Notes. Each seller as to which any Shelf Registration is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Issuer all information required to be disclosed in order to make any information previously furnished to the Issuer by such seller not materially misleading. If any such Registration Statement refers to any Holder by name or otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Issuer, then such Holder shall have the right to require (i) the insertion therein of language, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Holder, to the effect that the holding by such Holder of such securities is not to be construed as a recommendation by such Holder of the investment quality of the securities covered thereby and that such holding does not imply that such Holder will assist in meeting any future financial requirements of the Issuer, or (ii) in the event that such reference to such Holder by name or otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any similar federal statute then in force, the deletion of the reference to such Holder in any amendment or supplement to the applicable Registration Statement filed or prepared subsequent to the time that such reference ceases to be required. Each Holder of Registrable Notes and each Participating Broker-Dealer agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes that, upon actual receipt of any notice from the Issuer (x) of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5(c)(ii), 5(c)(iii), 5(c)(iv), or 5(c)(v) hereof, or (y) that the Board of Directors of the Issuer (the "Board of Directors") has resolved that the Issuer has a bona fide business purpose for doing so, then the Issuer may delay the filing or the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement (if not then filed or effective, as applicable) and shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness thereof or amend or supplement the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration, in all cases, for a period (a "Delay Period") expiring upon the earlier to occur of (i) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (x), such Holder's or Participating Broker-Dealer's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5(k) hereof or until it is advised in writing (the "Advice") by the Issuer that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments or supplements thereto or (ii) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (y), the date which is the earlier of (A) the date on which such business purpose
-18- ceases to interfere with the Issuer's obligations to file or maintain the effectiveness of any such Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement or (B) 60 days after the Issuer notifies the Holders of such good faith determination. There shall not be more than 60 days of Delay Periods during any 12-month period. Each of the Effectiveness Period and the Applicable Period, if applicable, shall be extended by the number of days during any Delay Period. Any Delay Period will not alter the obligations of the Issuer to pay Liquidated Damages under the circumstances set forth in Section 4 hereof. In the event of any Delay Period pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding paragraph, notice shall be given as soon as practicable after the Board of Directors makes such a determination of the need for a Delay Period and shall state, to the extent practicable, an estimate of the duration of such Delay Period and shall advise the recipient thereof of the agreement of such Holder provided in the next succeeding sentence. Each Holder, by his acceptance of any Registrable Note, agrees that during any Delay Period, each Holder will discontinue disposition of such Notes or Exchange Notes covered by such Registration Statement or Prospectus or Exchange Notes to be sold by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be. Section 6. Registration Expenses. All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with this Agreement by the Issuer (other than any underwriting discounts or commissions) shall be borne by the Issuer, whether or not the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration is filed or becomes effective or the Exchange Offer is consummated, including, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including, without limitation, (A) fees with respect to filings required to be made with the NASD in connection with an underwritten offering and (B) fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or Blue Sky laws (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel in connection with Blue Sky qualifications of the Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes and determination of the eligibility of the Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions (x) where the holders of Registrable Notes are located, in the case of an Exchange Offer, or (y) as provided in Section 5(h) hereof, in the case of a Shelf Registration or in the case of Exchange Notes to be sold by a Participating Broker-Dealer during the Applicable Period)), (ii) printing expenses, including, without limitation, expenses of printing a certificate or certificates for Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company and of printing prospectuses if the printing of prospectuses is requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes included in any Registration Statement or in respect of Exchange Notes to be sold by any Participating Broker-Dealer during the Applicable Period, as the case may be, (iii) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses, (iv) fees and disbursements of counsel for the Issuer and reasonable fees and disbursements of one special counsel for all of the sellers of Registrable Notes (exclusive of any counsel retained pursuant to Section 7 hereof), (v) fees and disbursements of all independent certified public accountants referred to in Section 5(m)(iii) hereof (including, without limitation, the expenses of any special audit and "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance), (vi) Securities Act liability insurance, if the Issuer desires such insurance, (vii) fees and expenses of all other Persons retained by the Issuer, (viii) internal expenses of the Issuer (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of officers and employees of the Issuer performing legal
-19- or accounting duties), (ix) the expense of any annual audit, (x) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the securities to be registered on any securities exchange, and the obtaining of a rating of the securities, in each case, if applicable, and (xi) the expenses relating to printing, word processing and distributing all Registration Statements, underwriting agreements, indentures and any other documents necessary in order to comply with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions of any underwriters with respect to any Registrable Notes sold by or on behalf of it. Section 7. Indemnification. (a) The Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Notes and each Participating Broker-Dealer selling Exchange Notes during the Applicable Period, each Person, if any, who controls any such Person within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, the agents, employees, officers and directors of each Holder and each such Participating Broker-Dealer and the agents, employees, officers and directors of any such controlling Person (each, a "Participant") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all reasonable amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation (in the manner set forth in clause (c) below)) (collectively, "Losses") to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Issuer shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by, arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided that (i) the foregoing indemnity shall not be available to any Participant insofar as such Losses are caused by any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Participant furnished to the Issuer in writing by or on behalf of such Participant expressly for use therein, and (ii) that the foregoing indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Participant from whom the Person asserting such Losses purchased Registrable Notes if (x) it is established in the related proceeding that such Participant failed to send or give a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if such amendment or supplement was furnished to such Participant prior to the written confirmation of such sale) to such Person with or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, if required by applicable law, and (y) the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was completely corrected in the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if amended or supplemented as aforesaid) and such Prospectus does not contain any other untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that was the subject matter of the related proceeding. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Issuer may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, liability under this Agreement.
-20- (b) Each Participant agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, each Person, if any, who controls the Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and each of its agents, employees, officers who sign the Registration Statement and directors and the agents, employees, officers and directors of any such controlling Person from and against any Losses to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Issuer shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by, arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Participant furnished in writing to the Issuer by or on behalf of such Participant expressly for use therein. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection 7(a) or 7(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding (collectively, an "action"), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the commencement of such action (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced in any material respect (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure) and provided, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it might have to an Indemnifying Party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in such action, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such action, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to take charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, or (iii) the named parties to such action (including any impleaded parties) include such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or parties (or such indemnifying parties have assumed the defense of such action), and such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded, after consultation with counsel, that there may be defenses available to it or them that are different from or additional to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. In no event shall the
-21- indemnifying party be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances. Any such separate firm for the Participants shall be designated in writing by Participants who sold a majority in interest of Registrable Notes sold by all such Participants and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Issuer and any such separate firm for the Issuer, its affiliates, officers, directors, representatives, employees and agents and such control Person of the Issuer shall be designated in writing by the Issuer and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Holders. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (d) In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is for any reason held to be unavailable from the indemnifying party, or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified under this Section 7, each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such aggregate Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by each indemnifying party, on the one hand, and each indemnified party, on the other hand, from the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers or the resale of the Registrable Notes by such Holder, as applicable, or (ii) if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of each indemnified party, on the one hand, and each indemnifying party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuer, on the one hand, and each Participant, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Issuer are to (y) the total net profit received by such Participant in connection with the sale of the Registrable Notes. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer or such Participant and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omission. (e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, (i) in no case shall any Participant be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net profit received by such Participant in connection with the sale of the Registrable Notes exceeds the amount of any damages that such Participant has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and
-22- (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this Section 7, notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 7 or otherwise, except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under this Section 7 for purposes of indemnification. Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, no party shall be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent, provided, however, that such written consent was not unreasonably withheld. Section 8. Rules 144 and 144A. The Issuer covenants that it will file the reports required, if any, to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, if at any time the Issuer is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder or beneficial owner of Registrable Notes, make available such information necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Issuer further covenants that for so long as any Registrable Notes remain outstanding it will take such further action as any Holder of Registrable Notes may reasonably request from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Notes without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144(k) and Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. Section 9. Underwritten Registrations. If any of the Registrable Notes covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable Notes included in such offering and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Issuer. No Holder of Registrable Notes may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder if such Holder does not (a) agree to sell such Holder's Registrable Notes on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) complete and execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. Section 10. Miscellaneous. (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Issuer has not, as of the date hereof, and shall not have, after the date of this Agreement, entered into any agreement with respect to any of its
-23- securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Notes in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not conflict with and are not inconsistent with, in any material respect, the rights granted to the holders of any of the Issuer's other issued and outstanding securities under any such agreements. The Issuer has not entered and will not enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities which will grant to any Person piggy-back registration rights with respect to any Registration Statement. (b) Adjustments Affecting Registrable Notes. The Issuer shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Registrable Notes as a class that would adversely affect the ability of the Holders of Registrable Notes to include such Registrable Notes in a registration undertaken pursuant to this Agreement. (c) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given except pursuant to a written agreement duly signed and delivered by (I) the Issuer and (II)(A) the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Registrable Notes and (B) in circumstances that would adversely affect the Participating Broker-Dealers, the Participating Broker-Dealers holding not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Exchange Notes held by all Participating Broker-Dealers; provided, however, that Section 7 and this Section 10(c) may not be amended, modified or supplemented except pursuant to a written agreement duly signed and delivered by the Issuer and each Holder and each Participating Broker-Dealer (including any Person who was a Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer of Registrable Notes or Exchange Notes, as the case may be, disposed of pursuant to any Registration Statement) affected by any such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders of Registrable Notes whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other Holders of Registrable Notes may be given by Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Notes being sold pursuant to such Registration Statement. (d) Notices. All notices and other communications (including, without limitation, any notices or other communications to the Trustee) provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered first-class mail, next-day air courier or telecopier: (i) if to a Holder of the Registrable Notes or any Participating Broker-Dealer, at the most current address of such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer, as the case may be, set forth on the records of the registrar under the Indenture.

(f) Counterparts.

It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable. (j) Securities Held by the Issuer or Its Affiliates. Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of Registrable Notes is required hereunder, Registrable Notes held by the Issuer or any of its affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage. (k) Third-Party Beneficiaries. Holders and beneficial owners of Registrable Notes and Participating Broker-Dealers are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and this Agreement may be enforced by such Persons. No other Person is intended to be, or shall be construed as, a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. (l) Attorneys' Fees. As between the parties to this Agreement, in any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or where any provision hereof is validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred in addition to its costs and expenses and any other available remedy.
