The criteria are based upon achievement of certain predetermined targets for (i) finding and development costs, (ii) pretax earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, and exploration expense, (iii) production per share, (iv) reserves per share and (v) stock price performance. The "reserves per share" criterion is not listed in the performance criteria on which awards may be based under the 2005 Plan. As a result, this criterion will be included in an amendment to the 2005 Plan to be presented to stockholders for approval in connection with the Company's 2006 annual meeting. In the event that the amendment to the 2005 Plan is not approved by stockholders, "reserve replacement percentage" will be substituted for "reserves per share" for purposes of the bonus awards criteria for fiscal year 2006.
