The Company also announced that its fourth quarter 2006 oil and gas price realizations (including the impact of hedging) averaged $6.56 per mcfe, representing a 4% decrease over the prior-year period and a 13% increase for the year. For 2007, approximately 80% of anticipated gas production is hedged at an average floor price of $8.11 per mcf, while 60% of 2008 gas production is hedged at an average floor price of $8.92 per mcf.

Commenting on the announcement, John Pinkerton, Range's President and CEO, said, "Achieving 15% production growth year-over-year and reaching 16 consecutive quarters of quarterly production increases are outstanding results. They reflect the quality of our asset base and are a testament to the competency and diligence of our operating teams. We are very pleased to have achieved double-digit production growth again in 2006 and anticipate double-digit growth for 2007 as well.
