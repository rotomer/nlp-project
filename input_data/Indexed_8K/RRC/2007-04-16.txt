("Pine Mountain"), entered into certain agreements, as further described below, with certain subsidiaries of Equitable Resources, Inc. ("Equitable"), with respect to a development plan for the Nora field, a gas field located in southwestern Virginia. Range and Equitable both own interests in the Nora field, which currently encompasses approximately 1,600 producing wells and 300,000 gross acres. Under the plan, Equitable and Range will equalize their interests in the Nora field, including the producing wells, undrilled acreage and gathering system.
Purchase and Sale Agreement
     Pine Mountain and Equitable Production Company ("Seller") entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Pine Mountain will acquire one-half of Seller's interest in leases on the Nora field (subject to specific exclusions) as well as new and additional incremental interest in existing wells in the Nora field (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition purchase price is $262 million, subject to certain adjustments. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each of Pine Mountain and Seller. The closing of the transactions under the Purchase Agreement is subject to various customary closing conditions as stated in the Purchase Agreement, the closing of the transactions under the Contribution Agreement described below and the settlement of a pending lawsuit between Seller and a third party. Title and interest in and to the assets will be transferred to Purchaser at closing, but certain financial benefits and burdens in respect of the assets will be transferred as of June 1, 2006.
     The Purchase Agreement is subject to termination by mutual agreement of Pine Mountain and Seller, by either party if the Acquisition is not closed by June 12, 2007, or by either party if (subject to the other party's right to cure) the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the Purchase Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material respects or the other party breaches in any material respect any of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
     The description of the Purchase Agreement herein is qualified by reference to the copy of the Purchase Agreement, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, EGEL and Seller will contribute to Nora Gathering the Nora gathering system currently owned by them in exchange for a 50% membership interest in Nora Gathering and Pine Mountain will contribute to Nora Gathering $53 million cash (subject to certain adjustments), in exchange for a 50% membership interest in Nora Gathering. At the closing, a cash amount of $22 million will be distributed by Nora Gathering to Seller. Following these contributions and distributions, the capital accounts of Pine Mountain and EGEL in Nora Gathering LLC will be equal. The Contribution Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each of the parties. The closing of the transactions under the Contribution Agreement is subject to various customary closing conditions as stated in the Contribution Agreement, including receipt of antitrust clearance, and the closing of the Acquisition. Title and interest in and to the assets will be transferred to Nora Gathering at the closing, but certain financial benefits and burdens in respect of the assets will be transferred to Nora Gathering as of June 1, 2006.
     The Contribution Agreement is subject to termination by mutual agreement of Pine Mountain and Seller, by Pine Mountain or Seller if the closing does not occur by June 12, 2007, by EGEL, Seller or Nora if (subject to Pine Mountain's right to cure) the representations and warranties of Pine Mountain contained in the Contribution Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material respects or Pine Mountain breaches in any material respect any of its obligations under the Contribution Agreement or by Pine Mountain if (subject to their right to cure) the representations and warranties of Seller, EGEL or Nora shall not be true and correct in all material respects or Seller, EGEL or Nora breaches in any material respect any of its obligations under the Contribution Agreement.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
     On April 16, 2007, Range and Equitable issued a joint press release describing the transactions to be consummated pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and to the Contribution Agreement, which is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this report. The slide presentation to investors with respect to the Equitable transaction is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
Sale of Austin Chalk Properties
     On February 13, 2007, Range completed the sale of its Austin Chalk properties located in central Texas to a private company for sale proceeds of $82.0 million. The properties were originally acquired by Range in mid-2006 as part of the Stroud Energy Inc. acquisition. Upon closing the Stroud acquisition, Range designated the properties as "properties held for sale." As a result, the production and associated operations were excluded from Range's income from continuing operations. In addition, the production and reserves associated with the properties are excluded from Range's historical production results and year-end 2006 proved reserves and this sale does not impact those previously reported amounts.
Sale of Gulf of Mexico Properties
     On March 30, 2007, Range sold its Gulf of Mexico properties to a private company for $155 million. The properties included interests in 37 platforms in water depths ranging from 11 to 240 feet. Range did not operate any of the properties. At year-end 2006, the properties were estimated to contain proved reserves of 38 Bcfe, representing 2% of total proved reserves. As a result of the sale, Range expects to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $100 million for the first quarter of 2007.
Consent for Registration Statements

Section 1.6
Back-In Interests
     . Immediately prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller are the owners of certain working interests relating to lands subject to the Original Lease and the Exploration Agreement. As part of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (as well as other transactions between the Parties and their Affiliates), the Parties desire to enter into a new lease agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "New Lease"), effective as of the Closing Date, with Purchaser as the lessor and Seller as the lessee, and to terminate the Original Lease, the Exploration Agreement and certain related agreements, effective as of the Closing Date. In addition to the working interests in the Leases and Review Wells and the related assets that Purchaser is purchasing from Seller under this Agreement (as such working interests are more particularly described in the column titled "Conveyed Working Interest" on Exhibit A-2 and the corresponding undivided interests in the Combined Assets associated therewith, the "Assets"). For purposes of clarification, the Parties acknowledge that each Party may currently own some of the interests that will be conveyed or cross conveyed under the Conveyance and that the Conveyance is intended to stipulate and clarify as of the Closing the interests that each of the Parties will own as of the Closing. In order to reflect Purchaser's pre-Effective Time working interests in the Wells drilled under the Original Lease and/or the Exploration Agreement, Seller, as the lessee under the New Lease, will enter into such conveyances (including the Conveyance) with Purchaser to confirm the pre-Effective Time working interests of Purchaser in such Wells and related assets that will be subject to the New Lease (as such pre-Effective Time working interests are more particularly described in the column titled "Purchaser Pre-Effective Time Working Interest" on Exhibit A-2 and the corresponding undivided interests included in the Combined Assets associated therewith, the "Pre-Effective Time Interests"). The Parties acknowledge that the Assets and the Pre-Effective Time Interests together constitute the Combined Assets and the term "Assets" as defined in this Agreement shall be the Combined Assets excluding the Pre-Effective Time
Section 1.7
Pre-Effective Time Interests and Assets
 
Interests, and upon Closing, Purchaser and all Purchaser Successors shall collectively hold the interest in each Review Well identified on Exhibit A-2 as the "Purchaser Closing Interest" for such Review Well and the same interest in the Proration Unit for such Review Well, and Seller shall hold the interest in each Review Well identified on Exhibit A-2 as the "Seller Closing Interest" for such Review Well and the same interest in the Proration Unit for such Review Well. Further, the parties acknowledge that certain existing wells drilled by PMOG or its predecessors upon the lands covered by the Original Lease were excluded under the Original Lease and are being excluded under the New Lease (as more particularly described therein), and such excluded wells shall not be part of the Combined Assets, Assets or Pre-Effective Time Interests.
     . The Parties acknowledge that it is their intent that (a) Seller transfer to Purchaser and Purchaser accept as of the Effective Time an undivided one-half (1/2) of Seller's interest existing as of the Closing Date in all leases (including without limitation Seller's interest as lessee under the EPC Lease, but for the avoidance of doubt, excluding its interest as lessor thereunder) included in Buchanan, Russell and Dickenson Counties, Virginia (excluding any interests in the lands and properties excluded from the AMI) and (b) pursuant to the Conveyance, Purchaser shall cross convey to Seller such interest in such leases (but excluding its interest as lessor under the Original Lease or the New Lease), such that the respective interests of the Parties in such leases as lessees thereunder shall be equal as of the Effective Time, whether or not such leases are included in or accurately described on Exhibit A-1. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that it is their intent that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that there are any Wells in which both Seller and Purchaser currently have a working interest that exist upon any Leases or within the AMI and that are not described on Exhibit A-2, the respective interests of the Parties in such Wells shall be the same interests as the Parties have in such Wells as of the date hereof; provided, however, if any such Well has been drilled by Seller upon the Leases or within the AMI on or after the Effective Time, then the Parties agree that their respective interests in such Wells and the Proration Units therefor as of the Effective Time shall be equal.
Section 1.8
Intentions of the Parties
     . The purchase price for the Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall be Two Hundred and Sixty-Two Million Dollars (US$262,000,000), adjusted as provided in Section 2.2.
Section 2.1
Purchase Price
 
     . The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:
Section 2.2
Adjustments to Purchase Price
     (a) Decreased by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received by Seller attributable to the Assets on and after 12:01 a.m. local time where the Assets are located on June 1, 2006 (the "Effective Time"):
     (i) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Assets (less any royalties, overriding royalties net profits interests and other similar burdens payable out of the production of Hydrocarbons from the Assets or the proceeds thereof which are not included in "Property Costs"); and
     (ii) any other proceeds received by Seller attributable to the Assets;
     (b) Decreased in accordance with Section 3.4;
     (c) Decreased in accordance with Section 3.5;
     (d) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs attributable to the Assets on and after the Effective Time which are incurred and paid by Seller excluding, however, any amounts deducted pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i) above;
     (e) [Intentionally omitted].
     (f) Increased by the amount of the Gathering Charges attributable to the Assets on and after the Effective Time;
     (g) Decreased by Six Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$600,000) to represent an adjustment (i) to the gathering rate paid by Purchaser in connection with gathering services on the Gathering Assets provided by Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time, (ii) for certain pre-Effective Time capital expenditures and (iii) for the Parties' agreement regarding resolution of the Pittston Litigation; and
     (h) Decreased by an amount equal to the difference between the (i) aggregate amount paid by Purchaser for gathering services on the Gathering Assets provided by Seller and its Affiliates for the period from (and including) the Effective Time until the Closing with respect to the Pre-Effective Time Interests, and (ii) the aggregate amount that would have been paid by Purchaser for gathering services on the Gathering Assets provided by Seller and its Affiliates for the period from (and including) the Effective Time until the Closing with respect to the Pre-Effective Time Interests if Purchaser would have been charged the Gathering Charges for such services.
     The Purchase Price, adjusted as set forth in this Section 2.2, shall be the "Adjusted Purchase Price."
 
     . The adjustment described in Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's entitlement under Section 1.5 to Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Assets between the Effective Time and the Closing and to other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets between the Effective Time and the Closing, and Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any production or income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has been made. Similarly, the adjustment described in Section 2.2(d) shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's obligation under Section 1.5 to pay Property Costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are incurred between the Effective Time and the Closing, and Purchaser shall not be separately obligated to pay for any Property Costs with respect to which an adjustment has been made.
Section 2.3
Effect of Purchase Price Adjustments
     . Schedule 2.4 sets forth the agreed allocation of the unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets, which has been made in accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury regulations thereunder. The "Allocated Value" for any Asset shall equal the portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on Schedule 2.4, increased or decreased as described in this Section 2.4. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price other than the adjustments provided for in Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(c) shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the amounts set forth on Schedule 2.4 for all Assets. After all such adjustments are made, any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(c) shall be applied to the amounts set forth in Schedule 2.4 for the particular affected Assets. Seller and Purchaser have accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, however, neither Seller nor Purchaser make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such Allocated Values. Seller and Purchaser agree (a) that the Allocated Values shall be used by Seller and Purchaser as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all applicable Tax returns, and (b) that neither they nor their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with the Allocated Values in notices to Governmental Authorities, in audit or other proceedings with respect to Taxes, in notices to preferential purchaser right holders, or in other documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (a) The Conveyance shall contain a special warranty of title against every Person lawfully claiming or to claim the interest to be conveyed by Seller to Purchaser or any part thereof by, through and under Seller and its Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject to Permitted Encumbrances, but shall otherwise be without warranty of title, express, implied or statutory, except that the Conveyance shall transfer to Purchaser all rights or actions on title warranties given or made by Seller's predecessors (other than Affiliates of Seller), to the extent Seller may legally transfer such rights.
 
     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.1(a) and the Conveyance, Section 3.4 shall provide Purchaser's exclusive remedy in respect of Asserted Title Defects reported in accordance with this Article 3, and, Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claims against Seller or any of its Affiliates under Seller's special warranty of title in the Conveyance against any such Asserted Title Defect. Except to the extent expressly provided herein (including Purchaser's rights with respect to any breach of Seller's covenant under Section 6.10(f) and Purchaser's rights under this Article 3) and except under the special warranty of title set forth in the Conveyance, Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claims against Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any Title Defects to the extent that such Title Defects pertain to the PM Assets (provided that if such Title Defects affect both the PM Assets and the other Assets, then Purchaser shall be entitled to any and all of its rights and remedies with respect to such Title Defects insofar and only insofar as such Title Defects affect such other Assets).
     . As used in this Agreement, the term "Defensible Title" means that title of Seller with respect to the Assets which, subject to Permitted Encumbrances:
Section 3.2
Definition of Defensible Title
     (a) entitles Seller to receive throughout the duration of the productive life of any Review Well (after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests or other similar burdens on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons), not less than the "Conveyed Net Revenue Interest" share shown in Exhibit A-2 for such Review Well of all Hydrocarbons produced and sold from such Review Well, as applicable, except (solely to the extent that such actions do not cause a breach of Seller's covenants under Section 6.10 hereof) decreases in connection with those operations in which, from or after the date of this Agreement, Seller may be a nonconsenting co-owner, decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment of pools or units from and after the date of this Agreement, and decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to make up past underdeliveries;
     (b) obligates Seller to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, a Review Well not greater than the "Conveyed Working Interest" shown in Exhibit A-2 for such Review Well without increase throughout the productive life of such Review Well, as applicable, except as stated in Exhibit A-2, respectively, and except increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to defaulting co-owners under applicable operating agreements and increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in Seller's net revenue interest; and
     (c) is free and clear of all Encumbrances.
     As used in this Agreement, the term "Encumbrance" means any lien, charge, encumbrance, irregularity or other defect (including a discrepancy or error in net revenue interest or working interest as set forth in Exhibit A-2 for a Review Well). The term "Title Defect" means, with respect to any Asset that is a Non-PM Asset, any Encumbrance that would cause
 
Seller not to have Defensible Title to such Non-PM Asset, and with respect to any Asset that is a PM Asset, the term "Title Defect" means any Encumbrance created by, through or under Seller or any of its Affiliates that would cause Seller not to have Defensible Title to such PM Asset.

     (b) all Contracts, to the extent that they do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce the "Conveyed Net Revenue Interest" below that shown in Exhibit A-2 with respect to any Review Well or increase the "Conveyed Working Interest" above that shown in Exhibit A-2 with respect to any Review Well without at least a proportionate increase in the net revenue interest for such Review Well;
     (c) Preferential Rights;

     (j) calls on production under existing Contracts that are listed on Exhibit A-7;
     (k) all rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authority to control or regulate any of the Wells or Undeveloped Lease Interests in any manner and all obligations and duties under all applicable Laws or under any franchise, grant, license or permit issued by any such Governmental Authority;

Section 3.4
Notice of Asserted Title Defects; Defect Adjustments
     (a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect prior to Closing, Purchaser must deliver a claim notice to Seller on or before 5:00 p.m. EDT on April 25, 2007 (the "Title Claim Date"), except as otherwise provided under Section 3.5 or Section 3.6; provided that Purchaser agrees to furnish Seller at the end of every week period following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Title Claim Date with a claim notice if any officer of Purchaser or its Affiliates discovers or learns of any Title Defect during such period. Each such notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the Asserted Title Defect(s), (ii) the Wells and/or Undeveloped Lease Interests affected,
 
(iii) the Allocated Values of the Wells and/or Undeveloped Lease Interests subject to such Asserted Title Defect(s), (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of such Asserted Title Defect(s) and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Values of those Wells and/or Undeveloped Lease Interests are reduced by such Asserted Title Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Purchaser's belief is based. Subject to Purchaser's rights under the special warranty of title described in Section 3.1(a) and its rights with respect to any breach of Seller's covenant under Section 6.10(f), Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all Title Defects of which Seller has not been given notice on or before the Title Claim Date.
     (b) In the event that Purchaser notifies Seller of a Title Defect before the Title Claim Date, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove any Asserted Title Defects of which it has been notified by Purchaser. If Seller so elects to cure or remove any Asserted Title Defect, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller's efforts to cure or remove such Asserted Title Defect. If prior to Closing, Seller has been unable to cure or remove any Asserted Title Defect, then Seller and Purchaser mutually shall elect to have one of the following options apply:
     (i) Remove the interests in such Well or Undeveloped Lease Interest included in the Assets that is subject to such Asserted Title Defect and those other Assets primarily related to such interest in such Well or Undeveloped Lease Interest from the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Such removed Assets shall not be assigned at the Closing, shall become "Excluded Assets" for all purposes hereunder and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value for such Assets, provided that if any Asserted Title Defect is cured at any time prior to one hundred eighty (180) days after Closing, within five (5) days of Seller's notice to Purchaser of such event, the Parties shall conduct a subsequent Closing (in accordance with the same terms hereof) for the purchase and sale of the Excluded Asset that was subject to such cured Asserted Title Defect.
     (ii) Assign the Asset subject to the Asserted Title Defect to Purchaser at Closing, and defend, indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and Purchaser Successors harmless from and against all Damages that arise out of or that any such Person may suffer as a result of such Asserted Title Defect pursuant to a form of indemnity agreement mutually agreeable to the Parties.
     (iii) Assign the Asset subject to the Asserted Title Defect to Purchaser at Closing, and reduce the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 3.4(c).
Provided that, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to mutually agree on one of the foregoing options, then the Parties shall be deemed to have chosen the option under subsection (i) above.
 
     (c) The Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount (the "Asserted Title Defect Amount") equal to the reduction in the Allocated Value for the interest in such Well or Undeveloped Lease Interest included in the Assets that is subject to an uncured Asserted Title Defect, which reduction is caused by such uncured Asserted Title Defect as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(e); provided that no reduction shall be made in the Purchase Price with respect to any Asserted Title Defect for which an election has been made pursuant to Section 3.4(b)(ii).
     (d) Except for Purchaser's rights under the special warranty of title described in Section 3.1(a) and its rights with respect to any breach of Seller's covenant under Section 6.10(f), Section 3.4(c) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser against Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any Title Defect attributable to the Combined Assets.
     (e) The Asserted Title Defect Amount resulting from an Asserted Title Defect shall be determined as follows:
     (i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Asserted Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Asserted Title Defect Amount;
     (ii) if the Asserted Title Defect is an Encumbrance which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Asserted Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Asserted Title Defect from the affected Well or Undeveloped Lease Interest;
     (iii) if the Asserted Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual net revenue interest included in the Assets for any Well or Undeveloped Lease Interest and (B) the "Conveyed Net Revenue Interest" stated on Exhibit A-2 for such Review Well, then the Asserted Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value for the interest in the affected Well or Undeveloped Lease Interest included in the Assets multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest decrease and the denominator of which is the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit A-2 for such interest; provided that if the Asserted Title Defect does not affect a Review Well throughout the life of such Review Well, the Asserted Title Defect Amount determined under this Section 3.4(e)(iii) shall be reduced accordingly;
     (iv) if the Asserted Title Defect represents an Encumbrance of a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Asserted Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the interest in the Review Well included in the Assets so affected, the portion of such interest in the Review Well affected by the Asserted Title Defect, the legal effect of the Asserted Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Asserted Title Defect over the life of the affected Review Well, the values placed upon the Asserted Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and
 
     (v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (A) except for adjustments required by Section 3.6, the aggregate Asserted Title Defect Amounts attributable to all Asserted Title Defects upon any given interest in a Review Well included in the Assets shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such interest in the Review Well and (B) except for adjustments required by Section 3.5 or Section 3.6, there shall be no Purchase Price adjustment for Asserted Title Defects unless and until the aggregate Asserted Title Defect Amounts for all interests in the Review Wells included in the Assets for which claim notices were timely delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a) exceed Two Million Six Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars (US$2,620,000.00), and then only to the extent that the aggregate Asserted Title Defect Amounts exceed Two Million Six Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars (US$2,620,000.00);
     (vi) if an Asserted Title Defect of the type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Asserted Title Defect Amount determined under subsection (iv) above shall not be greater than the lesser of (1) the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Asserted Title Defect or (2) the share of such curative work cost and expense which is allocated to such interest in such Review Well included in the Assets pursuant to subsection (vii) below; and
     (vii) the Asserted Title Defect Amount with respect to a Review Well shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses (i) included in another Asserted Title Defect Amount hereunder, or (ii) included in a casualty loss under Section 3.6. To the extent that the cost to cure any Asserted Title Defect will result in the curing of all or a part of one or more other Asserted Title Defects, such cost of cure shall be allocated for purposes of Section 3.4(e)(vi) among the interests in the Review Wells so affected on a fair and reasonable basis.
     (f) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts by two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by that date, the average of Seller's and Purchaser's estimates with respect to the Asserted Title Defect Amounts for the Asserted Title Defects shall be used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 8.4(a), and all Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.4(f). During the ten (10) Business Day period following the Closing Date, Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to an attorney with at least ten (10) years of experience in oil and gas titles in southwestern Virginia as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the date hereof, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 3.4(f). The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding
 
upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 3.4(e) and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, with the prior written consent of Purchaser and Seller, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the Title Arbitrator, including title attorneys from other states and petroleum engineers. In no event shall any Asserted Title Defect Amount exceed the estimate given by Purchaser in its claim notice delivered in accordance with Section 3.4(a). The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.
     .
Section 3.5
Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase
          (a) Seller will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practices in transactions of this type, to identify, with respect to all Assets, the names and addresses of all parties holding Preferential Rights and Consents applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. In attempting to identify the names and addresses of such parties holding such Preferential Rights and Consents, Seller shall in no event be obligated to go beyond its own records. Seller will request, from the parties so identified (and from any parties identified by Purchaser prior to Closing who have Preferential Rights or from whom a Consent may be required), in accordance with the documents creating such rights, execution of waivers of Preferential Rights or Consents so identified. Seller shall have no obligation other than to identify such Preferential Rights and Consents and to so request such execution of waivers of Preferential Rights and Consents (including, without limitation, Seller shall have no obligation to assure that such waivers of Preferential Rights and Consents are obtained).
          (b) With respect to Preferential Rights but not Consents, if a Person from whom a waiver of a Preferential Right is requested refuses to give such waiver prior to Closing, the interest in the Asset subject to such Preferential Right will be excluded from the transaction contemplated hereby, such interest in such Asset will become an "Excluded Asset" for all purposes hereunder (except in the case of any subsequent transfer of such interest in such Asset to Purchaser pursuant to the following sentence) and the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value (proportionately reduced to the excluded interest) for such interest in such Asset. If within ninety (90) days following Closing such holder does waive its Preferential Right, then Purchaser agrees that, within five (5) days following Seller's notice thereof, the Parties hereto will conduct a subsequent Closing (in accordance with same terms hereof) for the purchase and sale of such excluded Asset.
          (c) If (i) an Asset is subject to a Consent that prohibits the transfer of such Asset without compliance with the provisions of such Consent, (ii) the failure to comply with or obtain such Consent will result in a termination or other material impairment of any rights in relation to such Asset and (iii) such Consent is not obtained or complied with prior to the Closing, then
 
unless otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and Seller, the Asset or portion thereof affected by such Consent will be excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby, such Asset will become an "Excluded Asset" for all purposes hereunder (except in the case of any subsequent transfer of such Asset to Purchaser pursuant to the following sentence), and the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value for such excluded Asset or if no Allocated Value was given for such excluded Asset, then a value derived from the Allocated Value of the Assets to which such excluded Asset relates. If, within ninety (90) days following Closing, such Consent is obtained or otherwise complied with, then Purchaser agrees that, within five (5) days following Seller's notice thereof, the Parties hereto will conduct a subsequent Closing (in accordance with the same terms hereof) for the purchase and sale of such excluded Asset.
          (d) To the extent that the consent of PMOG with respect to the assignment of the Assets contemplated hereby is required under any agreement or arrangement, as of the Closing, PMOG hereby irrevocably grants such consent.
     . Subject to the provisions of Section 7.1(f) and Section 7.2(f) hereof, if, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close and the Parties mutually shall elect prior to Closing one of the following options: (i) to have Seller cause the Assets affected by any casualty to be repaired or restored, at Seller's sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii) to have Seller indemnify Purchaser through a document reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair the Assets subject to any casualty or (iii) to treat such casualty or taking as an Asserted Title Defect with respect to the affected Assets under Section 3.4; provided that in the event that the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4(b)(iii), then in no event shall such Asserted Title Defect be subject to the provisions of Section 3.4(e)(v) hereof; and provided further that if the Parties are unable to mutually elect one of the foregoing options, then the Parties shall be deemed to have chosen the option under subsection (iii) above. In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims against third parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

Section 4.1
Disclaimers

Purchaser shall be responsible for and indemnify Seller against, and Purchaser shall be entitled to all refunds and credits of, all Taxes with respect to the Assets that are attributable to that portion of any Straddle Taxable Period beginning after the Closing Date.

Purchaser shall give written notice to Seller of its receipt of any notice of any audit, examination, claim or assessment for any Tax which could result in any such proceeding within twenty (20) days after its receipt of such notice.

     . All claims for indemnification under Section 10.1 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:
Section 10.2
Indemnification Actions
     (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Indemnifying Person" when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an obligation to
 
indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Agreement, and the term "Indemnified Person" when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Agreement.
     (b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 10.1, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 10.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 10.1 except to the extent (and only to the extent of such incremental Damages incurred) such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Person's ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.
     (c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether or not it agrees to indemnify and defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this Article 10. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer, or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.
     (d) If the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Person, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim, which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, at its sole cost and expense, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 10.2(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from all liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii) may materially and
 
adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).
     (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not agree to indemnify the Indemnified Person within the thirty (30) day period specified in Section 10.2(c), fails to give notice to the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period regarding its election, or if the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify, but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person's choosing; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
     (f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) agree to indemnify the Indemnified Person for such Damages, or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If such Indemnifying Person does not respond to such Claim Notice within such thirty (30) day period, such Person will be deemed to dispute the claim for Damages.

Equitable shall be entitled to all income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time (provided that Equitable's entitlement to income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to, and responsibility for and entitlement to refunds with respect to Property Costs relating to, certain of the Assets shall be adjusted as of Closing in the manner described in Section 2.2). "Earned" and "incurred", as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board). Surface use fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable period falling before and at or after the Effective Time, except that production, severance and similar Taxes based upon revenues generated by the Assets shall be prorated based on the amount of revenues generated by the Assets before, or at and after the Effective Time. In each case, the Company shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period on and after the Effective Time and Equitable shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period before the Effective Time.
     (c) "Property Costs" means all operating expenses (including costs of insurance and ad valorem, property and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the Assets, but excluding any other Taxes), capital expenditures incurred in the ownership and operation of the Assets in the ordinary course of business, and overhead costs in each case as would have been charged to the Assets under the limited liability company agreement of the Company assuming it was in effect at all times during the period between the Effective Time and Closing.
     . The Parties acknowledge that the description of the Gathering Assets comprising the Nora Gas Gathering System (including the Nora-T Line) as provided on Exhibit A-1 may be incomplete, including with respect to easements, servitudes,

Intentions of the Parties
 
rights-of-way, surface leases and other surface rights and the plat of such system, and the Parties may amend Exhibit A-1 prior to the Closing Date in order to more fully describe the Gathering Assets (it being acknowledged by the Parties that the Gathering Assets are intended to cover all of Equitable's and its Affiliates' interests in and to their currently existing natural gas gathering system and related assets, other than the Excluded Assets and as set forth in the following sentence, located within the Nora Field including any currently existing sections of the Nora Gas Gathering System extending beyond the Nora Field that service wells in the Nora Field). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties further acknowledge that the Gathering Assets do not include any gas gathering system, facilities, compressors, pipelines, pig and other stations, Easements, or other assets and interests of EPC or EGEL in the separate gathering system commonly known as the Roaring Fork Gas Gathering System located within and outside of the Nora Field, which system is used as of the date hereof in connection with the transportation of Hydrocarbons produced from the wells listed on Exhibit A-4, among other wells.
     . On the terms contained in this Agreement, PMOG agrees to contribute to the Company at the Closing an amount of cash equal to Fifty-Three Million Sixty Five Thousand One Hundred Seventy Six Dollars and Thirteen Cents (US$53,065,176.13) (as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4 and Section 3.5, the "Cash Contribution"), to be applied as set forth in Section 2.3. Additionally, on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, PMOG agrees to contribute to the Company and the Company agrees to accept from PMOG, PMOG's right, title and interest (if any) in and to the gas gathering system, facilities, compressors and pipelines described on Exhibit A-1, excluding any interest that PMOG owns in its capacity as the lessor under the Original Lease or the New Lease or as Grantor under the New Easement Agreement. As consideration for the contribution of such assets and the Cash Contribution, the Company shall issue to PMOG a fifty percent (50%) membership interest in the Company.

Effective Time Adjustment
     (a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Equitable shall prepare in good faith, using the best information available to Equitable, and deliver to PMOG a preliminary settlement statement setting forth an estimated calculation of the net amount received (or paid) by Equitable for the account of the Company pursuant to Section 1.5(b) (such net amount being called herein the "Effective Time Adjustment. Such statement shall show the calculation of each adjustment, based, to the extent possible, on actual credits, charges, receipts and other items attributable to the period of time from and after the Effective Time and PMOG shall review such preliminary settlement statement and discuss with Equitable any changes necessary thereto. The Parties shall use their reasonable efforts exercised in good faith to agree upon such preliminary settlement statement as of Closing. An amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the estimated Effective Time Adjustment, set forth in the preliminary settlement statement mutually agreed to by the Parties in accordance with this Section 2.2(a), shall
 
constitute the dollar amount to be contributed by PMOG to the Company at the Closing (the "Closing Payment"), together with the Cash Contribution to be contributed by PMOG at Closing.
     (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but not later than the one hundred and twentieth (120) day following the Closing Date, Equitable shall prepare in good faith, using the best information available to Equitable, and deliver to PMOG a statement setting forth the final calculation of the Effective Time Adjustment and showing the calculation of each adjustment, based, to the extent possible, on actual credits, charges, receipts and other items attributable to the period of time from and after the Effective Time and shall supply reasonable documentation available to support any such credits, charges, receipts or other items. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the thirtieth (30) day following receipt of Equitable's statement hereunder, PMOG shall deliver to Equitable a written report containing any changes that PMOG proposes be made to such statement. Equitable and PMOG shall undertake to agree on the amount of the actual Effective Time Adjustment no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. In the event that such Parties cannot reach agreement within such period of time, either Equitable or PMOG may refer the remaining matters in dispute to Ernst & Young LLP, or if Ernst & Young LLP is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under this Section 2.2(b), such other nationally-recognized independent accounting firm as may be accepted by Equitable and PMOG, for review and final determination. The accounting firm shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the date hereof, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 2.2(b). The accounting firm's determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of the Effective Time Adjustment, the accounting firm shall not increase the Effective Time Adjustment more than the increase proposed by Equitable nor decrease the Effective Time Adjustment more than the decrease proposed by PMOG, as applicable. The accounting firm shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Equitable or PMOG and may not award damages or penalties. Equitable and PMOG shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Equitable and PMOG shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the accounting firm. Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of PMOG's thirty (30) day review period without delivery of any written report or (ii) the date on which the Equitable and PMOG, or the accounting firm, as applicable, finally determine the actual Effective Time Adjustment, (A) Equitable shall contribute to the Company an amount of cash equal to the amount by which the estimated Effective Time Adjustment exceeds the actual Effective Time Adjustment; or (B) PMOG shall contribute to the Company an amount of cash equal to eighty percent (80%) of the amount by which the actual Effective Time Adjustment exceeds the estimated Effective Time Adjustment.

     (b) Loan the remaining amount of cash contributed to the Company hereunder to ET Blue Grass Company, with such loan to be entered by a separate note in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, which loan shall be repaid prior to the Company requiring any capital contribution by PMOG or Equitable under the LLC Agreement.

     (i) all Contracts;
     (ii) Preferential Rights;

     (iv) liens for current Taxes or assessments not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, being contested in good faith by appropriate actions and listed on Exhibit A-5;
     (v) materialman's, mechanic's, repairman's, employee's, contractor's, operator's and other similar liens or charges arising in the ordinary course of business for amounts not yet delinquent (including any amounts being withheld as provided by Law), or, if delinquent, being contested in good faith by appropriate actions and listed on Exhibit A-6;
     (vi) all rights to consent, by required notices to, filings with, or other actions by Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale or conveyance of easements, rights of way, licenses, gathering facilities or interests therein if they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance;
     (vii) rights of reassignment arising upon final intention to abandon or release any easement or right of way;

     (x) all rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authority to control or regulate any of the Assets in any manner and all obligations and duties under all applicable Laws or under any franchise, grant, license or permit issued by any such Governmental Authority;

     (xiii) any matters shown on Exhibit F; and
     (xiv) any other Encumbrances which do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with the use, ownership or operation of the Assets subject thereto or affected thereby (as currently used, owned or operated) and which would be accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business of owning and operating gathering system or pipeline assets in the Appalachian Basin.

Section 3.3
Notice of Asserted Title Defects; Defect Adjustments
     (a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect prior to Closing, PMOG must deliver a claim notice to Equitable on or before 5:00 p.m. EDT on April 25, 2007 (the "Title Claim Date"), except as otherwise provided under Section 3.4 or Section 3.5; provided that PMOG agrees to furnish Equitable at the end of every week period following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Title Claim Date with a claim notice if any officer of PMOG or its Affiliates discovers or learns of any Title Defect during such period. Each such notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the Asserted Title Defect(s), (ii) the Assets affected, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Equitable (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Equitable) to verify the existence of such Asserted Title Defect(s) and (iv) the amount by which PMOG reasonably believes the value of those Assets is reduced by such Asserted Title
 
Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which PMOG's belief is based. Subject to the Company's rights under the special warranty of title described in Section 3.1(a) and its and PMOG's rights with respect to any breach of Equitable's covenant under Section 7.10(f), PMOG and the Company shall be deemed to have waived all Title Defects of which Equitable has not been given notice on or before the Title Claim Date.
     (b) In the event that PMOG notifies Equitable of a Title Defect before the Title Claim Date, Equitable shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove any Asserted Title Defects of which it has been notified by PMOG. If Equitable so elects to cure or remove any Asserted Title Defect, PMOG shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Equitable's efforts to cure or remove such Asserted Title Defect. If prior to Closing, Equitable has been unable to cure or remove any Asserted Title Defect, then Equitable and PMOG mutually shall elect to have one of the following options apply:
     (i) Remove the Assets subject to such Asserted Title Defect from the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, if the operation of Gathering Assets (taken as a whole) would not be materially impaired thereby. Such removed Assets shall not be assigned at the Closing, shall become "Excluded Assets" for all purposes hereunder and the Cash Contribution shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value for such Assets.
     (ii) Assign the Assets subject to the Asserted Title Defect to the Company at Closing, and defend, indemnify and hold the Company, the successors, assigns and Affiliates of the Company, PMOG and PMOG's Affiliates harmless from and against all Damages that arise out of or that any such Person may suffer as a result of such Asserted Title Defect pursuant to a form of indemnity agreement mutually agreeable to the Parties.
     (iii) Assign the Assets subject to the Asserted Title Defect to the Company at Closing, and reduce the Cash Contribution in accordance with Section 3.3(c).
     (c) The Cash Contribution shall be reduced by an amount (the "Asserted Title Defect Amount") equal to the reduction in the value for the Assets subject to an uncured Asserted Title Defect, which reduction is caused by such uncured Asserted Title Defect as determined pursuant to Section 3.3(e); provided that no reduction shall be made in the Cash Contribution with respect to any Asserted Title Defect for which an election has been made pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(ii).
     (d) Except for the Company's rights under the special warranty of title described in Section 3.1(a) and its and PMOG's rights with respect to any breach of Equitable's covenant under Section 7.10(f), Section 3.3(c) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, be the exclusive right and remedy of PMOG and the Company against Equitable or its Affiliates with respect to any Title Defect attributable to the Assets.
 
     (e) The Asserted Title Defect Amount resulting from an Asserted Title Defect shall be determined as follows:
     (i) If PMOG and Equitable agree on the Asserted Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Asserted Title Defect Amount;
     (ii) If the Asserted Title Defect is an Encumbrance which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Asserted Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Asserted Title Defect from the affected Assets;
     (iii) If the Asserted Title Defect represents an Encumbrance of a type not described in subsections (i) or (ii) above, the Asserted Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the value of the Assets so affected, the portion of the Assets affected by the Asserted Title Defect, the legal effect of the Asserted Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Asserted Title Defect over the life of the affected Assets, the values placed upon the Asserted Title Defect by PMOG and Equitable and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;
     (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, except for adjustments required by Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, there shall be no Cash Contribution adjustment for Asserted Title Defects unless and until the aggregate Asserted Title Defect Amounts for all Assets for which claim notices were timely delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(a) exceed Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars (US$350,000.00), and then only to the extent that the aggregate Asserted Title Defect Amounts exceed Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars (US$350,000.00);
     (v) If an Asserted Title Defect of the type not described in subsections (i) or (ii) above is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Asserted Title Defect Amount determined under subsections (iii) above shall not be greater than the lesser of (1) the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Asserted Title Defect or (2) the share of such curative work cost and expense which is allocated to such Assets pursuant to subsection (vi) below; and
     (vi) The Asserted Title Defect Amount with respect to an Asset shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses (A) included in another Asserted Title Defect Amount hereunder or (B) included in a casualty loss under Section 3.5. To the extent that the cost to cure any Asserted Title Defect will result in the curing of all or a part of one or more other Asserted Title Defects, such cost of cure shall be allocated for purposes of Section 3.3(e)(v) among the Assets so affected on a fair and reasonable basis.
 
     (f) Equitable and PMOG shall attempt to agree on all Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts by two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If Equitable and PMOG are unable to agree by that date, the average of Equitable's and PMOG's estimates with respect to the Asserted Title Defect Amounts for the Asserted Title Defects shall be used to determine the Effective Time Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2, and all Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.3(f). During the ten (10) Business Day period following the Closing Date, Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to an attorney with at least ten (10) years of experience in oil and gas and pipeline titles in the southwestern Virginia as selected by mutual agreement of PMOG and Equitable (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the date hereof, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 3.3(f). The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 3.3(e) and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, with the prior written consent of PMOG and Equitable, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the Title Arbitrator, including title attorneys from other states and petroleum engineers. In no event shall any Asserted Title Defect Amount exceed the estimate given by PMOG in its claim notice delivered in accordance with Section 3.3(a). The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Asserted Title Defects and Asserted Title Defect Amounts submitted by either PMOG or Equitable and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either PMOG or Equitable with respect to any matter. Equitable and PMOG shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Equitable and PMOG shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.
     .
Section 3.4
Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase
     (a) Equitable will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practices in transactions of this type, to identify, with respect to all Assets, the names and addresses of all parties holding Preferential Rights and Consents applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. In attempting to identify the names and addresses of such parties holding such Preferential Rights and Consents, Equitable shall in no event be obligated to go beyond its own records. Equitable will request, from the parties so identified (and from any parties identified by PMOG prior to Closing who have Preferential Rights or from whom a Consent may be required), in accordance with the documents creating such rights, execution of waivers of Preferential Rights or Consents so identified. Equitable shall have no obligation other than to identify such Preferential Rights and Consents and to so request such execution of waivers of Preferential Rights and Consents (including,
 
without limitation, Equitable shall have no obligation to assure that such waivers of Preferential Rights and Consents are obtained).
     (b) With respect to Preferential Rights but not Consents, if a Person from whom a waiver of a Preferential Right is requested refuses to give such waiver prior to Closing, the interest in the Asset subject to such Preferential Right will be excluded from the transaction contemplated hereby, such interest in such Asset will become an "Excluded Asset" for all purposes hereunder (except in the case of any subsequent transfer of such interest in such Asset to PMOG pursuant to the following sentence) and the Cash Contribution will be adjusted downward by the value (proportionately reduced to the excluded interest) for such interest in such Asset. If within ninety (90) days following Closing, such holder does waive its Preferential Right, then PMOG agrees that, within five (5) days following Equitable's notice thereof, the Parties hereto will conduct a subsequent Closing (in accordance with same terms hereof) for the purchase and sale of such Excluded Asset.
     (c) If (i) an Asset is subject to a Consent that prohibits the transfer of such Asset without compliance with the provisions of such Consent, (ii) the failure to comply with or obtain such Consent will result in a termination or other material impairment of any rights in relation to such Asset, (iii) such Consent is not obtained or complied with prior to the Closing and (iv) the absence of such Asset would not materially impair the operations of the Gathering Assets (taken as a whole), then unless otherwise agreed to by PMOG and Equitable, the Asset or portion thereof affected by such Consent will be excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby, such Asset will become an "Excluded Asset" for all purposes hereunder (except in the case of any subsequent transfer of such Asset to PMOG pursuant to the following sentence), and the Cash Contribution will be adjusted downward by the agreed upon value for such Asset. If within ninety (90) days following Closing such Consent is obtained or otherwise complied with, then PMOG agrees that, within five (5) days following Equitable's notice thereof, the Parties hereto will conduct a subsequent Closing (in accordance with the same terms hereof) for the purchase and sale of such excluded Asset.
     (d) To the extent that the consent of PMOG with respect to the assignment of the Assets contemplated hereby is required under any agreement or arrangement, as of the Closing, PMOG hereby irrevocably grants such consent.
     . Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1(e) and Section 8.2(f) hereof, if, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, PMOG and the Company shall nevertheless be required to close and the Parties mutually shall elect prior to Closing one of the following options: (i) to have Equitable cause the Assets affected by any casualty to be repaired or restored, at Equitable's sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii) to have Equitable indemnify the Company, PMOG, and their respective Affiliates through a document reasonably acceptable to Equitable and PMOG against any costs or expenses that such
Section 3.5
Casualty or Condemnation Loss
 
Person reasonably incurs to repair the Assets subject to any casualty or (iii) to treat such casualty or taking as an Asserted Title Defect with respect to the affected Assets under Section 3.3; provided that in no event shall such Asserted Title Defect be subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(e)(iv) hereof. In each case, Equitable shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims against third parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent Equitable and PMOG otherwise agree in writing.

     (d) Inclusion of a matter on a schedule attached hereto with respect to a representation or warranty that addresses matters having a Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter does, or may, have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not agree to indemnify the Indemnified Person within the thirty (30) day period specified in Section 11.2(c), fails to give notice to the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period regarding its election, or if the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify, but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person's choosing; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
     (f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) agree to indemnify the Indemnified Person for such Damages, or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If such Indemnifying Person does not respond to such Claim Notice within such thirty (30) day period, such Person will be deemed to dispute the claim for Damages.

Exhibit 99.2
) announced today that they have agreed to a development plan for the Nora Field, a gas field located in Southwestern Virginia.
(PITTSBURGH) APRIL 16, 2007  EQUITABLE RESOURCES INC. (NYSE: EQT) AND RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC
The companies own interests in the Nora Field, which encompasses approximately 1,600 producing wells and more than 300,000 gross acres under lease. Under the plan, Equitable and Range will equalize their interests in the Nora Field, including the producing wells, undrilled acreage and gathering system. To equalize the interests, Range will pay to Equitable and a newly formed gathering joint venture between the companies an aggregate of $315 million, subject to customary adjustments.
Upon completion of the transaction, Equitable will continue to operate the producing wells, manage the drilling operations of all future coal bed methane wells and manage the gathering system. Range will oversee the drilling of formations below the coal bed methane formation, including the tight gas sand formations, shales and deeper formations. The Nora Field contains more than 1,150 producing coal bed methane wells and more than 450 producing tight gas sand wells. Given the size of the field, there is potential to drill nearly 6,000 additional coal bed methane wells and tight gas sand wells.
Also, the Nora Field is located within 10 miles of the Big Sandy shale gas field in Kentucky and West Virginia. Range and Equitable believe there is significant shale gas potential at Nora.
The transaction will allow each company to apply its specific expertise to jointly develop the Field more effectively and at a faster pace. Equitable is an industry leader in Appalachian coal bed methane operations. Additionally, Equitable has extensive pipeline assets and expertise throughout the Appalachian Basin in the area of pipeline construction and natural gas transmission. Conversely, Range has drilled thousands of tight gas sand wells in the Appalachian Basin and is developing and drilling several shale gas plays across five basins, including the Appalachian Basin.
Both companies have executed the definitive agreements covering the transaction. The transaction closing, subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, is anticipated to occur in May.
"We are enthusiastic about the expansion of an already productive relationship with Range Resources," said Murry S. Gerber, chairman and CEO, Equitable Resources. "Together, we will accelerate the development of the Nora Field at a much faster pace than we could otherwise do on our own."
Commenting on the announcement, John H. Pinkerton, Range's president and CEO, said, "This is a win-win transaction combining the strengths of both organizations. The Nora Field has tremendous untapped potential, and this transaction establishes the blue print to unlock the value by aligning both companies' interest and focusing each company on what it does best. We look forward to working with Equitable's well-qualified team to quickly initiate the Nora Field development plan in what is an extraordinary opportunity for both companies."

Disclosures in this news release that are not historical information, including those relating to the pending transaction, may contain forward-looking statements, such as the timing of development and future expenses as falls within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These statements assume that the conditions to closing the transaction are satisfied and that the transaction is consummated, and are based on other assumptions and estimates that both management teams believe are reasonable, based on currently available information; however, assumptions and future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties, and there is no assurance that the transaction will be consummated or that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the volatility of oil and gas prices, the costs and results of drilling and operations, the timing of production, mechanical and other inherent risks associated with oil and gas production, weather, the availability of drilling equipment, changes in interest rates, litigation, uncertainties about reserve estimates, environmental risks and other risks and uncertainties. Neither company undertakes an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in either company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.3
today provided an operations update. First quarter 2007 production volumes rose to 306 Mmcfe per day, a 19% increase over the prior-year period. This represents the highest quarterly production in Range's history. The increase is attributable to the success of the Company's multi-year drilling program. Range has now recorded 17 consecutive quarters of sequential production growth.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS, APRIL 16, 2007RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC)
During the first quarter of 2007, Range sold its Austin Chalk properties and all of its Gulf of Mexico properties for a total consideration of $237 million. These sales will reduce Range's production in the future. Offsetting these divestitures, Range has acquired or is in the process of acquiring additional interests in three fields where it is active. In February, Range acquired the minority owner's interest in its northern Oklahoma shallow oil play for $30 million. Earlier this month, Range acquired the minority owner's interest in a southern Tarrant County Barnett shale field for $29 million. It was in this field that Range recently drilled a well that was placed on production at an initial rate in excess of 12 Mmcfe per day. With these two acquisitions, Range now owns 100% working interest in both fields. Earlier today, Range announced that it is acquiring from Equitable Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EQT) additional interests in the Nora field, located in southwestern Virginia for $315 million. In this transaction, Range and Equitable are equalizing their interests in the Nora field, whereby each company will own a 50% interest in approximately 1,600 producing wells, 300,000 gross acres of leasehold and the gas gathering system. Range will retain its separate mineral and royalty interest in the Nora field that covers roughly 80% of the acreage. The Nora field transaction is anticipated to close in May after the expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing.
Reflecting the divestitures and the acquisitions noted above, Range has increased its 2007 production growth target from 15% to 16%. In addition, the Company has increased its 2007 capital expenditure budget 18% to $822 million. Of the increase, approximately 50% is associated with drilling expenditures to exploit the newly acquired interests, 35% is associated with expanding the Nora field gathering system and 15% is attributable to other fields where recent drilling results provide exceptional additional near-term opportunities. Range's 2006 year-end reserves pro forma for the 2007 divestitures and acquisitions would be 1.87 Tcf, up 6.5%.
The funding of the acquisitions and capital program will be provided by operating cash flow, proceeds from the asset sales and bank borrowings. To maintain a strong financial condition, the Company expects to complete an equity offering subject to market conditions.
With the announcement of the Nora transaction, the Company provided additional operational updates:
 
Commenting on the announcement, John Pinkerton, Range's President and CEO, said, "In addition to a terrific start to our 2007 drilling program, we have been actively high-grading our property base. The net result of the divestitures and acquisitions noted above is that we have expanded our property base with high-quality, long-life reserves, and we have materially increased our upside potential. In particular, the Nora field, which encompasses 300,000 gross acres, puts us in an excellent position to more aggressively pursue the development of a field with tremendous potential. Besides increasing reserves and lengthening the reserve life, we have improved our cost structure by reducing unit operating costs and lowering our DD&A rate. We estimate these transactions are accretive to 2007 results, but most importantly, we believe these transactions will add materially to our future performance."
The Company will host a conference call on Monday, April 16 at 9:00 a.m. ET to review the items mentioned in this release. The Company has posted on its website slides which further detail items covered by this press release.

Except for historical information, statements made in this release, including those related to estimates of oil and gas reserves, anticipated production, capital expenditures and anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and the Company's future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the volatility of oil and gas prices, the costs and results of drilling and operations, the timing of production, mechanical and other inherent risks associated with oil and gas production, weather, the availability of drilling equipment, changes in interest rates, litigation, uncertainties about reserve estimates, and environmental risks. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are incorporated by reference.
Range's internal estimates of reserves, particularly those in the properties recently acquired where we may have limited review of data or experience with the reserves, may be subject to revision and may be different from estimates by our external reservoir engineers at year-end. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has generally permitted oil and gas companies, in filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the terms "probable," "possible," "unproven" or "upside potential" to describe volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the company. While we believe our calculations of unproven drill sites and estimation of unproven reserves have been appropriately risked and are reasonable, such calculations and estimates have not been reviewed by third-party engineers or appraisers.
