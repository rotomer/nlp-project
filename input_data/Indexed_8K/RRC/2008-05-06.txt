     The terms of the Notes are governed by the Indenture, dated as of May 6, 2008 (the "Indenture"), by and among Range, the Subsidiary Guarantors and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 6, 2008 (the "Supplemental Indenture"). The notes will mature on May 1, 2018. Interest will accrue from May 6, 2008, and the first interest payment date will be November 1, 2008. Range may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after May 1, 2013 at the redemption prices specified in the Supplemental Indenture. Range may also redeem up to 35% of the notes using all or a portion of the net proceeds of certain public sales of equity interests completed before May 1, 2011. Range may also redeem the notes prior to May 1, 2013 upon payment of the make-whole premium specified in the Supplemental Indenture. If Range sells certain of its assets or upon the occurrence of certain changes in control, Range must offer to repurchase the notes. The notes are unsecured, and are subordinated to all of Range's existing and future senior debt, rank equally with all of Range's existing and future senior subordinated debt and rank senior to all of Range's existing and future subordinated debt. Other material terms of the Notes, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture are described in the prospectus supplement, dated May 1, 2008, as filed by Range and the Subsidiary Guarantors with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on May 2, 2008.
     Range and the Subsidiary Guarantors registered the sale of the Notes and the underlying guarantees with the Commission pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on April 28, 2008 (the "Registration Statement").
     The Notes were sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated May 1, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among Range and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"). The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Range, and customary conditions to closing, indemnification rights, obligations of the parties and termination provisions. Range has agreed with the Underwriters not to offer or sell any debt securities issued or guaranteed by Range having a term of more than
 
one year (other than the Notes) for a period of 60 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
     The Underwriters or their affiliates have from time to time provided investment banking, commercial banking and financial advisory services to Range and its affiliates, for which they have received customary compensation. The Underwriters and their affiliates may provide similar services in the future. In particular, certain of the underwriters or their affiliates are lenders under Range's senior credit facility and will receive a portion of the note proceeds from this offering. In addition, from time to time, certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in Range's debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future.
     The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such Underwriting Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be and any reference to "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

     (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither of the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction.

Indemnification of the Company.
     (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraphs (a) and (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraphs (a) and (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, or (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities

Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the
Contribution.
 
Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date there shall have occurred (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or a declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination

(a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes.

Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

     12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

Annex D
 
We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering (after deducting discounts to the underwriters and estimated expenses of the offering) will be approximately $244.5 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our senior credit facility.
In addition, on April 30, 2008, we priced our public offering of 4,200,000 common shares at $66.38 per share. We expect to receive net proceeds from that offering of approximately $266.9 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In addition, we have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 630,000 additional shares of our common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. We intend to use the net proceeds from that offering, together with any net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our senior credit facility.
Any such amounts paid down on our senior credit facility with the net proceeds from this offering or the 4,200,000 share common share offering may be reborrowed from time to time for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acreage acquisitions.
The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates.

Every replacement Security is an additional Obligation of the Company and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity must be furnished that is sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company and the Trustee from any loss they may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company may charge the Holder for the expenses of the Company and the Trustee in replacing a Security.

     (1) Securities cancelled by the Trustee or delivered to it for cancellation;
     (2) any Security which has been replaced pursuant to Section 2.06 unless and until the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a purchaser; and

     (3) on or after the maturity date or any redemption date or date for repurchase of the Securities pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer, those Securities payable or to be redeemed or repurchased on that date for which the Trustee (or Paying Agent, other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds money sufficient to pay all amounts then due.
 
     (b) A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Affiliates holds the Security, that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Securities have given or taken any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action hereunder, Securities owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, (it being understood that in determining whether the Trustee is protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, only Securities which the Trustee actually knows to be so owned will be so disregarded). Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company or any Affiliate of the Company.
provided
     Section 2.08.
Temporary Securities.
     Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee will authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities will be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have insertions, substitutions, omissions and other variations determined to be appropriate by the Company Officer executing the temporary Securities, as evidenced by the execution of the temporary Securities. If temporary Securities are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities will be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for the purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any temporary Securities the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities will be entitled to the same benefits under the Indenture as definitive Securities.
     Section 2.09.
Cancellation.
     The Company at any time may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold. Any Registrar or the Paying Agent will forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to it for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee will cancel all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and dispose of them in accordance with its document retention procedures or the written instructions of the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has paid in full or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
     Section 2.10.
CUSIP and CINS Numbers.
     The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" and "CINS" numbers, and the Trustee will use CUSIP numbers or CINS numbers in notices of redemption or exchange or in offers to purchase as a convenience to Holders, the notice to state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any
 
notice of redemption or exchange. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP or CINS numbers.
     Section 2.11
Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
     (a) The Securities will be issued in registered form only, without coupons, and the Company shall cause the Registrar to maintain a register (the "") of the Securities, for registering the record ownership of the Securities by the Holders and transfers and exchanges of the Securities.
Register
     (b) (1) Each Global Security will be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee and, so long as DTC is serving as the Depositary thereof, will bear the DTC Legend set forth in Exhibit A.
     (2) Each Global Security will be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for the Depositary. Transfers of a Global Security (but not a beneficial interest therein) will be limited to transfers thereof in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees, except (x) as set forth in Section 2.11(b)(4) and (y) transfers of portions thereof in the form of Certificated Securities may be made upon request of an Agent Member (for itself or on behalf of a beneficial owner) by written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures of the Depositary and in compliance with this Section 2.11.
     (3) Agent Members will have no rights under the Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, and the Depositary shall be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary or its nominee may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person (including any Agent Member and any Person that holds a beneficial interest in a Global Security through an Agent Member) to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Securities, and nothing herein will impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any security.
     (4) If (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for a Global Security and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the notice or (y) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee has received a request from the Depositary, the Trustee will promptly exchange each beneficial interest in the Global Security for one or more Certificated Securities in authorized denominations having an equal aggregate principal amount registered in the name of the owner of such beneficial interest, as identified to the Trustee by the Depositary, and thereupon the Global Security will be deemed canceled. Each Certificated Security will be registered in the name of the Holder thereof or its nominee.
     (c) A Holder may transfer a Security to another Person or exchange a Security for another Security or Securities of any authorized denomination by presenting to the Trustee a
 
written request therefor stating the name of the proposed transferee or requesting such an exchange. The Registrar will promptly register any transfer or exchange that meets the requirements of this Section by noting the same in the Register maintained by the Registrar for the purpose; that
provided
     (x) no transfer or exchange will be effective until it is registered in such Register and
     (y) the Trustee will not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or repurchased, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption or repurchase in whole or in part, except, in the case of a partial redemption or repurchase, that portion of any Security not being redeemed or repurchased, or (iii) if a redemption or a repurchase is to occur after a regular record date but on or before the corresponding related interest payment date, to register the transfer of or exchange any Security on or after the regular record date and before the date of redemption or repurchase. Prior to the registration of any transfer, the Company, the Trustee and their agents will treat the Person in whose name the Security is registered as the owner and Holder thereof for all purposes (whether or not the Security is overdue), and will not be affected by notice to the contrary.
     From time to time the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate additional Securities as necessary in order to permit the registration of a transfer or exchange in accordance with this Section.
     No service charge will be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of any Security, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than a transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchange pursuant to subsection (b)(4)).
     (d) (1) . If a beneficial interest in a Global Security is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in another Global Security, the Trustee will (x) record a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Security being transferred or exchanged equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (y) record a like increase in the principal amount of the other Global Security. Any beneficial interest in one Global Security that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security, or exchanged for a beneficial interest in another Global Security, will, upon transfer or exchange, cease to be an owner of a beneficial interest in such Global Security and become an owner of a beneficial interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer and exchange restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest.
Global Security to Global Security
     (2) . If a beneficial interest in a Global Security is transferred or exchanged for a Certificated Security, the Trustee will (x) record a decrease in the principal amount of such Global Security equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (y) deliver one or more new Certificated
Global Security to Certificated Security
 
Securities in authorized denominations having an equal aggregate principal amount to the transferee (in the case of a transfer) or the owner of such beneficial interest (in the case of an exchange), registered in the name of such transferee or owner, as applicable.
     (3) . If a Certificated Security is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security, the Trustee will (x) cancel such Certificated Security, (y) record an increase in the principal amount of such Global Security equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (z) in the event that such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Certificated Security, deliver to the Holder thereof one or more new Certificated Securities in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Certificated Security, registered in the name of the Holder thereof.
Certificated Security to Global Security
     (4) . If a Certificated Security is transferred or exchanged for another Certificated Security, the Trustee will (x) cancel the Certificated Security being transferred or exchanged, (y) deliver one or more new Certificated Securities in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange to the transferee (in the case of a transfer) or the Holder of the canceled Certificated Security (in the case of an exchange), registered in the name of such transferee or Holder, as applicable, and (z) if such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Certificated Security, deliver to the Holder thereof one or more Certificated Securities in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Certificated Security, registered in the name of the Holder thereof.

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, that no such special record date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest.

A new Security in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Security. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Securities or portions of them called for redemption. Except as provided in this Section 3.02, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.

     Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor with any provision of this Indenture, the Securities or the Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Securities held by a non-consenting Holder):
     (a) reduce the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
     (b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Security or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Securities (except as provided above with respect to Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.13 hereof);
     (c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Security;
     (d) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities (except a rescission of acceleration of the Securities by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
     (e) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Securities;
     (f) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Securities to receive payments of principal or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities; or
     (g) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
     Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Securities as aforesaid,
 
and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.
     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Securities under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
     After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Securities affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.
     Section 9.03.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
     Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Securities shall be set forth in an amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
     Section 9.04.
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
     Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Security and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder of a Security or subsequent Holder of a Security may revoke the consent as to its Security if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
     The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix such record date as it may select for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.
     Section 9.05.
Notation on or Exchange of Securities.
     The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Security thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for all Securities may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Securities that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
     Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Security shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
     Section 9.06.
Trustee to Sign Amendment, etc.
     The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor may sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until its respective Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and that there has been compliance with all conditions precedent.
     Section 10.01.
Agreement to Subordinate.
     The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor agree, and each Holder by accepting a Security and the related Guarantees agrees, that (i) the Indebtedness evidenced by (a) the Securities, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities, and any other payment Obligation of the Company in respect of the Securities (including any obligation to repurchase the Securities) is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article, to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt of the Company (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and (b) the Guarantees and other payment Obligations in respect of the Guarantees are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article, to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt of each Subsidiary Guarantor and (ii) the subordination is for the benefit of the Holders of Senior Debt.

provided
     Under the circumstances described in this Section 10.03, the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar person making any payment or distribution of cash or other property or securities is authorized or instructed to make any payment or distribution to which the Holders of the Securities and the related Guarantees would otherwise be entitled (other than securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust referred to in the second parenthetical clause of each of clauses (a)(1), (b)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2) above, which shall be delivered or paid to the Holders of Securities as set forth in such clauses) directly to the holders of the Senior Debt of the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, (to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Debt of the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, held by such holders) or their Representatives, or to any trustee or trustees under any other indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests appear, to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior Debt in full, in cash or
pro rata
 
cash equivalents after giving effect to any concurrent payment, distribution or provision thereof or to or for the holders of such Senior Debt.
     To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Debt (whether by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Debt or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. To the extent the obligation to repay any Senior Debt is declared to be fraudulent, invalid or otherwise set aside under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then the obligation so declared fraudulent, invalid or otherwise set aside (and all other amounts that would come due with respect thereto had such obligation not been so affected) shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as Senior Debt for all purposes hereof as if such declaration, invalidity or setting aside had not occurred.
     Section 10.04.
Default on Designated Senior Debt.
     The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors may not make any payment (whether by redemption, purchase, retirements, defeasance or otherwise) upon or in respect of the Securities and the related Guarantees (other than securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments and other distributions made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.05 hereof if the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture) until all principal and other Obligations with respect to the Senior Debt of the Company have been paid in full if:
     (i) a default in the payment of any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on Designated Senior Debt occurs; or
     (ii) any other default occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Debt that permits, or with the giving of notice or passage of time or both (unless cured or waived) would permit, holders of the Designated Senior Debt as to which such default relates to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "") from the Company or the holders of any Designated Senior Debt. If the Trustee receives any such Payment Blockage Notice, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until 360 days shall have elapsed since the date of commencement of the payment blockage period resulting from the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No nonpayment default in respect of any Designated Senior Debt that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice.
Payment Blockage Notice
 
     The Company shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Securities and any Subsidiary Guarantor shall resume making payments and distributions pursuant to the Guarantees upon:
     (1) in the case of a default referred to in Section 10.04(i) hereof the date upon which the default is cured or waived, or
     (2) in the case of a default referred to in Section 10.04(ii) hereof, the earliest of (1) the date on which such nonpayment default is cured or waived, (2) the date the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is retracted by written notice to the Trustee and (3) 90 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received unless (A) the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated or (B) a Default or Event of Default under Section 6.01(9) (10) has occurred and is continuing,
or
if this Article otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment or acquisition.
     Section 10.05.
Acceleration of Securities.
     If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify holders of Senior Debt of the acceleration.
     Section 10.06.
When Distribution Must be Paid Over.
     In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives any payment or distribution of or in respect of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or the Guarantees at a time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 10.03 or Section 10.04 hereof, such payment or distribution shall be held by the Trustee (if the Trustee has actual knowledge that such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 10.03 or Section 10.04) or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered to, the holders of Senior Debt as their interests may appear or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which such Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt.
     With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and, except as provided in Section 10.12, shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders of Securities or the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
 
     Section 10.07.
Notice by Company.
     The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or the related Guarantees to violate this Article, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Securities and the related Guarantees to the Senior Debt as provided in this Article.
     Section 10.08.
Subrogation.
     After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness with the Securities and the Guarantees) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that distributions and payments otherwise payable to the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt. A payment or distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees is not, as between the Company and Holders of Securities, a payment by the Company on the Securities.
pari passu
     Section 10.09.
Relative Rights.
     This Article defines the relative rights of Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees and holders of Senior Debt. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
     (1) impair, as between the Company and Holders of Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Securities in accordance with their terms;
     (2) affect the relative rights of Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or
     (3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees.
     If the Company fails because of this Article to pay principal of or interest on a Security on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.
     Section 10.10.
Subordination May Not be Impaired by Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors.
     No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as provided in this Article 10 will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company or any
 
Subsidiary Guarantor with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of Senior Debt may have or otherwise be charged with. The provisions of this Article 10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of Senior Debt.
     Section 10.11.
Payment, Distribution or Notice to Representative.
     Whenever a payment or distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.
     Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10.
     Section 10.12.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Securities and the Guarantees, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least one Business Day prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or Guarantees to violate this Article, which notice shall specifically refer to Section 10.03 or 10.04 hereof. Only the Company or a Representative may give the notice. Nothing in this Article 10 shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof.
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
     Section 10.13.
Authorization to Effect Subordination.
     Each Holder by the Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 6.09 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, each lender under the Credit Agreement is hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Securities and the related Guarantees.
 
     Section 10.14.
Amendments.
     No amendment may be made to the provisions of or the definitions of any terms appearing in this Article 10, or to the provisions of Section 6.02 relating to the Designated Senior Debt, that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Debt (or any group or Representative authorized to give a consent) consent to such change.
     Section 10.15.
No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.
     Without in any way limiting the generality of Section 10.09 of this Indenture, the holders of Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring responsibility to the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article 10 or the obligations hereunder of the Holders to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding or secured; (b) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor and any other Person.
     Section 11.01.
The Guarantees.
     Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, on the Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on premium and interest, on the Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other
 
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities and this Indenture. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, or any Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders of Securities in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors further agrees that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any Subsidiary Guarantor not paying so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantees.
     Section 11.02.
Execution and Delivery of Guarantees.
     (i) To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit B shall be endorsed by an officer of such Subsidiary Guarantor on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor by an Officer thereof.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such Guarantee.
     If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the applicable Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security on which such Guarantee is endorsed, such Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
     The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Subsidiary Guarantors.
 
     Section 11.03.
Subsidiary Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.
     No Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the Surviving Person) another Person, whether or not affiliated with such Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:
     (a) subject to the provisions of Section 11.04 hereof, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee in respect of the Securities, this Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee;
     (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
     (c) such transaction does not violate any of Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16 and 4.17.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be permitted to consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), another corporation, Person or entity pursuant to the preceding sentence if such consolidation or merger would not be permitted by Section 5.01 hereof.
     In case of any such consolidation or merger and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Guarantee endorsed upon the Securities and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by such Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for such Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
     Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger of any Subsidiary Guarantor with or into the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of any Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor.

Indenture
     The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors to the Holders of Securities and to the Trustee pursuant to this Guarantee and the Indenture (including the subordination provisions thereof) are expressly set forth in Article 11 of the Indenture, and reference is hereby made to such Indenture for the precise terms of this Guarantee. The terms of Article 11 of the Indenture are incorporated herein by reference.
     This is a continuing Guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding upon each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and its respective successors and assigns to the extent set forth in the Indenture until full and final payment of all of the Company's Obligations under the Securities and the Indenture and shall inure to the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and their successors and assigns and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder of Securities or the Trustee, the rights and privileges herein conferred upon that party shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor that satisfies the provisions of Section 11.04 of the Indenture shall be released of its obligations hereunder. This is a Guarantee of payment and not a, guarantee of collection.

The Indenture provides that, in making any determination as to the solvency or sufficiency of capital of a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the previous sentence, the right of such Subsidiary Guarantor to contribution from other Subsidiary Guarantors and any other rights such Subsidiary Guarantor may have, contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account.

United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the redemption date to May 1, 2013 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

     8. . The registered Holder of a Note shall be treated as its owner for all purposes.
Persons Deemed Owners
     9. . Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or the tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default under, or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended on supplemented to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder, or to comply with the requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
     10. . The Indenture provides that if an Event of Default (other than with respect to bankruptcy events) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
Defaults and Remedies
     11. . The Notes are subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company as provided in the Indenture. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Debt must be paid before the Notes may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, and any other payment Obligation of the Company in respect of the Notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt of the Company (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed) and authorizes the Trustee to give effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose.
Subordination
     12. . The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue or resign.
Trustee Dealings with Company
 
     13. . No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
