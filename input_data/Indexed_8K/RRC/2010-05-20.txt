Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     (e) Compensatory Arrangements with Certain Officers
     On May 19, 2010 at the annual stockholders meeting (the "Annual Meeting") of Range Resources Corporation (the "Company"), the stockholders of the Company approved and adopted the First Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Company's Amended and Restated 2005 Equity-Based Compensation Plan (the "2005 Plan") to increase the number of shares of the common stock authorized to be issued under the Company's 2005 Plan by 850,000 shares.
     Pursuant to the Amendment, 850,000 additional Plan Shares (as defined in the 2005 Plan) will be immediately available for future awards under the 2005 Plan. As of March 26, 2010, 3,082,136 shares are available for awards under the 2005 Plan. As part of the approval of the 2005 Plan by the stockholders in 2005, the Company agreed to suspend any further grants under the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the "1999 Plan") and transfer the authorized but unissued shares in the 1999 Plan to the 2005 Plan. Therefore, the 2005 Plan provides that any shares related to options currently outstanding under the 1999 Plan which lapse or are forfeited will become available for issuance under the 2005 Plan. Pursuant to the Amendment, the maximum number of shares available for future award under the 2005 Plan (assuming none of the shares underlying options currently outstanding under the 1999 Plan lapse or are forfeited) has increased from 3,082,136 to 3,932,136 shares. The additional 850,000 shares approved under the Amendment have been added to the existing 4,825,000 authorized 162(m) Covered Shares (as defined in the 2005 Plan) approved by stockholders specifically for the 2005 Plan.
     The foregoing description is a brief summary of the Amendment and does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the 2005 Plan. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the First Amendment to Range Resources Corporation Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Based Compensation Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     On May 19, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company authorized the amendment and restatement of the Company's By-laws (the "By-laws" and as amended and restated, the "Amended By-laws"). The Amended By-laws became effective immediately upon their adoption by the Board. Among other items, the amendments include the following:

The only matters that may be considered at a Special Meeting are those specified in the notice of such Special Meeting; provided, however, that nothing in these By-laws shall prohibit the Board from submitting matters to the Stockholders at any Special Meeting called pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(ii) of these By-laws. Except in accordance with Section 2.3(a)(ii) of these By-laws and the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(b) of these By-laws, no Stockholder or Stockholders may call or require the Corporation to call a Special Meeting.
          (b) Any Stockholder or Stockholders seeking to have the Corporation call a Special Meeting pursuant to Section 2.3(a) of these By-laws shall first be required to request in writing that the Board fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Stockholders entitled to request the Corporation to call such a Special Meeting, which request shall be delivered to the Secretary in accordance with Section 5.1 of these By-laws. Within ten days after receipt of a request in compliance with this Section 2.3(b) from any such Stockholder or Stockholders, the Board shall adopt a resolution fixing a record date for the purpose of determining Stockholders entitled to request the Corporation to call such Special Meeting, which date must be on or after the date upon which the Board adopts the resolution fixing such record date, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the Board adopts the resolution fixing such record date. If no resolution fixing a record date is adopted by the Board within such ten day period after the receipt of such a request, the record date shall be the twentieth day after the date on which such request is received.
          (c) If none of the Stockholders who submitted the request for a Special Meeting appears or sends a qualified representative to present the matters for consideration that were specified in the request for Special Meeting, the Corporation need not present such matters for a vote at such meeting. To be considered a qualified representative of a Stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such Stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such Stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such Stockholder to act for such Stockholder as proxy at the Special Meeting and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable copy of such writing or electronic transmission, at the Special Meeting.

Notice of any meeting of Stockholders shall not be required to be given to any Stockholder who (i) attends such meeting in person or by proxy and (ii) does not, at the beginning of such meeting, object to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or any Stockholder who, either before or after the meeting, submits a waiver of notice. The Board may cancel, postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled Annual Meeting or any Special Meeting called in accordance with Section 2.3(a)(i) of these By-laws.
     Section 2.5 . Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at such meeting of Stockholders. The chairman of a meeting of Stockholders or holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders who are present, in person or by proxy, at such meeting of Stockholders may adjourn such meeting of Stockholders or any adjournment thereof, from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum. No notice of the date, time and place, if any, of adjourned meetings of Stockholders need be given if the date, time and place, if any, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which the Stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting of Stockholders at which adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which notice was originally given, notice of the date, time and place, if any, and the means of remote communication, if any, of the adjourned meeting by which Stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity with these By-laws. If, after the adjournment, a new record date for determination of Stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix as the record date for determining Stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each Stockholder of record as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, in person or by proxy, any business may be transacted which may have been transacted at the original meeting had a quorum been present, in person or by proxy. Stockholders present at a duly convened meeting of Stockholders at which a quorum is present when such meeting of Stockholders convenes may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the subsequent withdrawal of sufficient Stockholders or proxyholders to reduce the total number of voting shares below the number of shares required for a quorum.
Quorum; Adjournment
     Section 2.6 . If authorized by the Board, and subject to any guidelines and procedures that the Board may adopt, Stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of Stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in any meeting of Stockholders and be deemed present in person or
Meetings by Remote Communication
 
by proxy and vote at such meeting, whether the meeting is to be held in a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (a) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a Stockholder or proxyholder, (b) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to provide Stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the Stockholders, including the opportunity to read or hear the proceedings in the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (c) if the Stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of the vote or other action is maintained by the Corporation.
     Section 2.7 . When a quorum is present at any meeting of Stockholders, any question, other than election of Directors, brought before such meeting shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon present in person or represented by proxy, unless express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation require a different vote on such question, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Every Stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, every Stockholder shall have one vote for each share having voting power registered in the Stockholder's name on the books of the Corporation. Each proxy shall be revocable unless expressly provided to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power or unless otherwise made irrevocable by law.
Voting
     Section 2.8 . A Stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation, such Stockholder has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote such shares, in which case only the pledgee, or the pledgee's proxy, may represent such shares and vote such shares.
Voting of Stock of Certain Holders
     Section 2.9 . The Corporation shall not vote, directly or indirectly, shares of its own stock owned by it; and such shares shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares.
Treasury Stock
     Section 2.10 .
Closing Transfer Books or Fixing Record Date
          (a) So that the Corporation may determine the Stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of Stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall be on or after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the Stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
 
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of Stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Stockholders shall apply to any adjourned meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for Stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of Stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting.
          (b) So that the Corporation may determine the Stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no such record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining Stockholders for any such purpose shall be the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating to such other action.
     Section 2.11 .
Notice of Stockholder Business at Annual Meeting
          (a) At an Annual Meeting, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (i) by the Corporation and specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board or (iii) by any Stockholder who (x) was a Stockholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such business is brought, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of stock of the Corporation) both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 2.11 and at the time of the meeting, (y) is entitled to vote at such meeting and (z) (A) complies with the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section 2.11 and (B) provides any updates or supplements to such notice at the times and in the manner required by paragraph (d) of this Section 2.11.

     (xi) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such Proposing Person that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation;

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, unless otherwise required by law, if the Proposing Person (or a qualified representative of the Proposing Person) does not appear at the Annual Meeting to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

Within ten days after receipt of a request in compliance with this Section 2.14, the Board shall adopt a resolution fixing a record date for the
 
purpose of determining the Stockholders entitled to authorize or take such action by written consent, which date shall be on or after the date upon which the Board adopts a resolution fixing such record date, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the Board adopts the resolution fixing such record date. If no resolution fixing a record date has been adopted by the Board within such ten day period after the date on which such a request is received, (1) the record date for determining Stockholders entitled to authorize or take any action by written consent, when no prior action of the Board is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is received by the Secretary in accordance with Section 5.1 of these By-laws and (2) the record date for determining Stockholders entitled to authorize or take any action by written consent, when prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, shall be the date on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
          (c) No action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the Secretary, such other officer of the Corporation as designated by the Board or inspectors of election appointed by the Board, as applicable, completes a review, determines that the consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 2.14 represent not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and certifies such determination to the Board for entry in the records of the Corporation .
          (d) Except as provided by law, no action may be authorized or taken by the Stockholders by written consent except in accordance with this Section 2.14. If the Board shall determine that any request to fix a record date or to take Stockholder action by written consent was not properly made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.14, or the Stockholder or Stockholders seeking to authorize or take such action do not otherwise comply with the provisions of this Section 2.14, then the Board shall not be required to fix a record date and any such purported action by written consent shall be null and void to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

     Section 6.3 .

Any officer or agent may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Corporation.

Upon the receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of uncertificated shares, such uncertificated shares shall be cancelled, the issuance of new equivalent uncertificated shares or certificated shares shall be made to the Stockholder entitled thereto and the transaction shall be recorded upon the books of the Corporation.

Reliance upon Books, Reports and Records

The Stockholders shall also have power to adopt, amend or repeal these By-laws.
     Section 11.1 . Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether brought or threatened by or in the right of the Corporation or by any other person, governmental authority or instrumentality (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person, or another person of whom such first person is the legal representative, (a) is or was a Director, officer or employee of the Corporation or (b) while a Director, officer or employee of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or any other entity or enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a Director, officer or employee of the Corporation or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by law against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
Right to Indemnification and Advancement
 
("") excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of such person's heirs, executors and administrators. The right to indemnification conferred by this Article XI shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a Director or officer in such person's capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a Director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise. The Corporation may elect to indemnify and advance expenses of any person who serves as an agent of the Corporation to the same extent the Corporation provides such rights to its Directors and officers.
ERISA
     Section 11.2 . If a claim under Section 11.1 of these By-laws is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty calendar days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving the defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal counsel or its Stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the circumstances that the claimant has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal counsel or its Stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard.
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
     Section 11.3 . The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article XI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person seeking indemnification or payment of expenses may have or hereafter acquire under any law, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws or any amendment of these By-laws, agreement, vote of Stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. Neither the amendment or repeal of this Article XI or any part of it nor the adoption of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws or of any law inconsistent with this Article XI or any of the Sections hereof shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article XI or any of the
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
 
Sections hereof in respect of any acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.
     Section 11.4 . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and some or all of the persons entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses by the Corporation under this Article XI or otherwise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
Insurance
     Section 11.5 . If any provision under this Article XI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article XI (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article XI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article XI (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Article XI containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision or provisions held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable and the Corporation shall nevertheless advance expenses, indemnify and hold harmless each person who was serving each person who is entitled to advancement of expenses or indemnification by the Corporation under this Article XI or otherwise against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) to the full extent permitted by any applicable provision of this Article XI that shall not have been held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable and to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL.
Severability
     Section 11.6 . For purposes of this Article XI, references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the Corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger prior to (or, in the case of an entity specifically designated in a resolution of the Board, after) the adoption of these By-laws and which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had the power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, trustees and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article XI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
