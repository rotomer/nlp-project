ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
     (d) Exhibits:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: January 21, 2011
 

Exhibit 99.1
today provided information on fourth quarter 2010 production volumes and price realizations. Fourth quarter 2010 production volumes averaged 541.0 Mmcfe per day, a record high for Range. Fourth quarter 2010 production increased 18% over the prior-year period and was 8% higher than third quarter 2010. Range has now achieved 32 consecutive quarters of sequential production growth. Production for full-year 2010 averaged 495.3 Mmcfe per day, a 14% increase over 2009. This represents Range's seventh consecutive year of double-digit production growth. Adjusting for asset sales, the 14% production growth in 2010 would have been 19%.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS, JANUARY 19, 2011...RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC)
The Company also announced that its preliminary fourth quarter 2010 oil and gas price realizations (including the impact of cash-settled hedges and derivative settlements which would correspond to analysts' estimates) averaged $5.33 per mcfe. This represents a 19% decrease from the prior-year period, but a 7% increase as compared to the third quarter 2010. Production and realized prices by each commodity for the fourth quarter were: natural gas  409.9 Mmcfe per day ($4.38), natural gas liquids  16,316 barrels per day ($42.09) and crude oil  5,527 barrels per day ($72.41).
For 2011, the Company has hedged 408,200 Mmbtu per day of anticipated natural gas production. The volumes are hedged at an average floor price of $5.56 per Mmbtu and an average cap price of $6.48 which the Company paid an average premium of $0.33 per Mmbtu.
Commenting on the announcement, John Pinkerton, Range's Chairman and CEO, said, "Achieving our seventh year of quarter-over-quarter production growth is a remarkable milestone. Most importantly, production per share, on a debt-adjusted basis, rose nearly 13% in 2010, representing our fifth consecutive year of per-share production growth. Coupling consistent production and reserve growth per share with our low-cost structure is the formula for driving up shareholder value. With our large inventory of low-cost, high-return drilling projects, we are well-positioned to continue to create value for our shareholders."
The information in this release is unaudited. Audited and final results, including final fourth quarter 2010 oil and gas price realizations (including the impact of cash-settled hedges and derivative settlements) will be provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 currently planned to be filed with Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of February or early March 2011.
