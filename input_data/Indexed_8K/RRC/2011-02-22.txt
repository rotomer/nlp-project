The $2.0 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility provided for by the Credit Agreement (the "Revolving Credit Facility") is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. This Credit Agreement replaces the prior Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and institutions named (therein) as lenders, which would have expired on October 26, 2012.
     The new Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum facility amount of $2.0 billion with the initial total commitments of the lenders on January 18, 2011 of $1.5 billion. The loan matures on February 18, 2016. Borrowings under the facility can either be, at the Company's election: (i) at the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a spread ranging from 0.50% to 1.50% or (ii) LIBOR borrowings at the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a spread ranging from 1.50% to 2.5%. The applicable spread is dependent upon borrowings relative to the borrowing base. The facility contains customary covenants including, but not limited to, (i) a minimum current ratio and a maximum leverage ratio and (ii) limitations on incurrence of investments, liens on assets, transactions with affiliates, mergers consolidations and sales of assets. The facility also includes customary events of default, conditions, representations and warranties and indemnification provisions.
     The indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, along with certain hedging obligations owed to lenders or their affiliates and certain other obligations owed to lenders or their affiliates, are guaranteed by certain of the Company's direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
     The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
     Affiliates of certain of the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future, investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received, and may continue to receive, customary fees and commissions.

Letters of Credit.
     (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own or the account of any Restricted Subsidiary in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
General.
     (b)  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $200,000,000 and (ii) the Aggregate Credit Exposure shall not exceed the lesser of (1) the Borrowing Base then in effect and (2) the Aggregate Commitment.
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.
     (c)  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

Range Resources Credit Agreement  Page 32
 
     (d)  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Aggregate Commitment, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations.
     (e)  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m. on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice; that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.08 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.08 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
provided
     (g)  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures.
provided
     (h)  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.14(c) shall apply.

     (i)  The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.13(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

          (i) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on or before the fifth (5) Business Day after the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 66-2/3% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in the Cash Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to the total LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of ARTICLE IX.
th
provided
          (ii) All cash collateral provided by the Borrower or any other Credit Party pursuant to the request of the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.21(c) shall be deposited in the Cash Collateral Account.

Borrower hereby grants a security interest in such cash and each deposit account (including the Cash Collateral Account) into which such cash is deposited to secure the Obligations under this Agreement. Subject to clause (iv) below, the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Cash Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits and interest at the rate per annum in effect for accounts of the same type maintained with the Administrative Agent at such time, which investments shall be of the type described in clause (b) of the definition of Permitted Investments

Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the Cash Collateral Account. Moneys in the Cash Collateral Account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing 66-2/3% or more of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations under this Agreement and to the extent any excess remains after payment in full in cash of all Obligations and the termination of all Commitments, such excess shall be released to the Borrower.

     (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.07(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
provided
     (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to

Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
provided
     (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.05 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
     (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.04:
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
Range Resources Credit Agreement  Page 37
 
     (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
     (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Majority Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

     (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein and its registered assigns.

Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.

     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
     Section 2.16.
Increased Costs.
     (a) If any Change in Law shall:
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or
     (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any
Range Resources Credit Agreement  Page 42
 
such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered provided such Lender or Issuing Bank is generally charging such costs to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities.
     (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy and provided such Lender or Issuing Bank's holding company is generally charging such costs to other similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
     (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth (i) the amount or amounts reasonably necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section, (ii) the factual basis for such compensation and (iii) the manner in which such amount or amounts were calculated shall be delivered to the Borrower. Such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
     (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.

Taxes.
     (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

A certificate delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, setting forth (i) the amount of such payment or liability reasonably necessary to compensate the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, (ii) the factual basis

for such compensation and (iii) the manner in which such amount or amounts were calculated, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall be indemnified for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes hereunder unless the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall make written demand on the Borrower for such reimbursement no later than 180 days after the earlier of (A) the date on which the relevant Governmental Authority makes written demand upon the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank for payment of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, and (B) the date on which the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank has made payment of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; , that if the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted giving rise to such claims are retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
provided
     (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
     (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
     (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.18, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.18 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

Range Resources Credit Agreement  Page 45
 
such Lender or other recipient shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender or other recipient has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from any such payments.
     Section 2.19.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
     (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.16, Section 2.17 or Section 2.18, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at JPMorgan Loan Services, 10 South Dearborn, Floor 07, Chicago, Illinois 60603-2003, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Section 2.16, Section 2.17, Section 2.18 and Section 11.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
     (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest, fees and other Obligations then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties; that in the event such funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent as a result of the exercise of any rights and remedies with respect to any Collateral under the Security Instruments, the parties entitled to a ratable share of such funds pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) and the determination of each parties' ratable share shall include, on a basis, (x) the Lender Counterparties with respect to Lender Hedging Obligations then due and owing to each Lender Counterparty by any Credit Party as a result of the early termination of any transactions under any Swap Agreements (after giving effect to any netting agreements) and (y) any Lender or any of its Affiliates with respect to Cash Management Obligations then due and owing to such Lender or any of its Affiliates by any Credit Party.

participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
     (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
     (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.07(d) or Section 2.07(e), Section 2.08(b), Section 2.19(d) or Section 11.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

     Section 2.20.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
     (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.16 or Section 2.18, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
     (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 11.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.16 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.18, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
     (c) If (i) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires approval of all of the Lenders, each Lender or each Lender affected thereby under Section 11.02 (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt with respect to this clause (i), any increase in the Borrowing Base), the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more other Lenders whose consent is required has not been obtained, (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.03, in connection with any increase in the Borrowing Base, the approval of the Super-Majority Lenders shall have been obtained but the approval of Super-Majority Borrowing Base Lenders has not been obtained (any such non-consenting Lender or non-approving Lender with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) a ""), or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender; then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, elect to replace such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender, as the case may be, as a Lender party to this Agreement in accordance with

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply or, in the case of a Defaulting Lender, such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender.

provided
     (c) if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
     (i) all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 are satisfied at that time;
     (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, within three (3) Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance

with the procedures set forth in Section 2.07(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

     (iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.13(a) and Section 2.13(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
     (v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.13(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and
     (d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and any participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
     If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Bank shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
     In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; , that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and , , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any

As soon as available and in any event by March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 2011, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a Reserve Report, prepared as of the immediately preceding December 31 and June 30, respectively, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and prepared by an Approved Petroleum Engineer (or, in the case of the Reserve Report due on September 1 of each year, by petroleum engineers employed by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries), said Reserve Report to utilize economic and pricing parameters established from time to time by the Administrative Agent, together with such other information, reports and data concerning the value of the Borrowing Base Properties as the Administrative Agent shall deem reasonably necessary to determine the value of such Borrowing Base Properties. Simultaneously with the delivery to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of each Reserve Report, the Borrower shall submit to the Administrative Agent and each Lender the Borrower's requested amount of the Borrowing Base as of the next Redetermination Date. Promptly after the receipt by the Administrative Agent of such Reserve Report and Borrower's requested amount for the Borrowing Base, the Administrative Agent shall submit to the Lenders a recommended amount of the Borrowing Base to become effective for the period commencing on the next Redetermination Date.
Reserve Report; Proposed Borrowing Base
Initial Borrowing Base
     Section 3.02. . Based on the Reserve Reports made available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.01, the requisite Lenders shall redetermine the Borrowing Base on or prior to the next Redetermination Date (or such date promptly thereafter as reasonably possible based on the engineering and other information available to the Lenders) in accordance with this Section 3.02. Any Borrowing Base which becomes effective as a result of any Redetermination shall be subject to the following restrictions: (a) such Borrowing Base shall not exceed the Maximum Facility Amount, (b) to the extent such Borrowing Base represents an increase in the Borrowing Base in effect prior to such Redetermination, such Borrowing Base must be approved by the Super-Majority Borrowing Base Lenders, and (c) to the extent such Borrowing Base represents a reaffirmation or decrease in the Borrowing Base in effect prior to such Redetermination or a reaffirmation of such prior Borrowing Base, such Borrowing Base must be approved by the Administrative Agent and Required Lenders. If a redetermined Borrowing Base is not approved by the Administrative Agent and Required Lenders within twenty (20) days after the submission to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent of its recommended Borrowing Base pursuant to Section 3.01, or by the Super-Majority Borrowing Base Lenders within such twenty (20) day period in the case of any increase in the Borrowing Base, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender that the recommended Borrowing Base has not been approved and request that each Lender submit to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) days thereafter its proposed Borrowing Base. Promptly following the 10 day after the

Administrative Agent's request for each Lender's proposed Borrowing Base, the Administrative Agent shall determine the Borrowing Base for such Redetermination by calculating the highest Borrowing Base then acceptable to the Administrative Agent and a number of Lenders sufficient to constitute Required Lenders (or the Super-Majority Borrowing Base Lenders in the case of an increase in the Borrowing Base). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that each Redetermination shall be based upon the loan collateral value which the Administrative Agent and each Lender in its sole discretion (using such methodology, assumptions and discount rates as the Administrative Agent and such Lender customarily uses in assigning collateral value to Oil and Gas Interests) assigns to the Borrowing Base Properties at the time in question and based upon such other credit factors consistently applied (including, without limitation, the assets, liabilities, cash flow, business, properties, prospects, management and ownership of the Credit Parties) as the Administrative Agent and such Lender customarily considers in evaluating similar oil and gas credits, including adjustments to reflect the effect of any Swap Agreements of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries as such exist at the time of such Redetermination. It is expressly understood that the Administrative Agent and Lenders have no obligation to designate the Borrowing Base at any particular amount, except in the exercise of their discretion, whether in relation to the Aggregate Commitment or otherwise.

In any case in which any Guarantor makes or is obligated to make payment in Dollars, the Guarantor shall hold the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties harmless from any loss incurred by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Secured Party arising from any change in the value of Dollars in relation to the Payment Currency between the date the Guaranteed Liability becomes due and the date the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such other Secured Party is actually able, following the conversion of the Dollars paid by such Guarantor into the Payment Currency and remittance of such Payment Currency to the place where such Guaranteed Liability is payable, to apply such Payment Currency to such Guaranteed Liability.
