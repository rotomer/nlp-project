Exhibit 99.1
     The following unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information is presented to illustrate the effect of Range Resources Corporation's April 29, 2011 sale of substantially all of its Barnett Shale assets on its historical financial position and operating results. The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations have been prepared to assist in analysis of the financial effects of the divestiture, including the reclassification of operations of such assets as discontinued operations. This information is based on the historical financial statements of Range and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Range Resources Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 1, 2011 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2011, filed with the SEC on April 27, 2011.
     The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2011 has been prepared to give effect to the divestiture as if it had occurred on March 31, 2011. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 have been prepared to give effect to the divestiture as if it had occurred on January 1, 2008. An unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 is not provided since the results of the Barnett Shale operations were reported as discontinued operations in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2011 filed with the SEC on April 27, 2011.
     The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations included herein is not necessarily indicative of the results that might have occurred had the divestiture taken place on the respective dates assumed.
 
 
 
 
 
(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION
     On April 29, 2011, Range Resources Corporation sold substantially all of its Barnett Shale assets and certain derivative contracts subject to the terms of a purchase and sale agreement dated February 28, 2011. The sale had an effective date of February 1, 2011 and consequently operating net revenues after that date is a downward adjustment to the selling price through the normal post closing provisions of the agreement.
     The accompanying unaudited consolidated pro forma balance sheet and unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations have been prepared to give effect to the divestiture as if it had occurred on March 31, 2011 for the pro forma consolidated balance sheet and on January 1, 2008 for the pro forma consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with SEC pro forma presentation rules, an unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 is not provided since the results of the Barnett Shale operations were reported as discontinued operations for that time period. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, we recognized income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $8.4 million.
     The following are descriptions of the individual columns included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet, the accompanying pro forma consolidated statements of operations and notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
