(e) Compensatory Arrangements with Certain Officers.
     On May 18, 2011 at the annual stockholders meeting (the "Annual Meeting") of Range Resources Corporation (the "Company"), the stockholders of the Company approved and adopted the Second Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Company's Amended and Restated 2005 Equity-Based Compensation Plan (the "2005 Plan") to increase the number of shares of the common stock authorized to be issued under the Company's 2005 Plan by 850,000 shares.
     Pursuant to the Amendment, 850,000 additional Plan Shares (as defined in the 2005 Plan) will be immediately available for future awards under the 2005 Plan. As of March 25, 2011, 4,435,678 shares are available for awards under the 2005 Plan. As part of the approval of the 2005 Plan by the stockholders in 2005, the Company agreed to suspend any further grants under the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the "1999 "Plan") and transfer the authorized but unissued shares in the 1999 Plan to the 2005 Plan. Therefore, the 2005 Plan provides that any shares related to options currently outstanding under the 1999 Plan which lapse or are forfeited will become available for issuance under the 2005 Plan. Pursuant to the Amendment, the maximum number of shares available for future award under the 2005 Plan (assuming none of the shares underlying options currently outstanding under the 1999 Plan lapse or are forfeited) has increased from 4,435,678 to 5,285,678 shares. The additional 850,000 shares approved under the Amendment have been added to the existing 5,675,000 authorized 162(m) Covered Shares (as defined in the 2005 Plan) approved by stockholders specifically for the 2005 Plan.
     The foregoing description is a brief summary of the Amendment and does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the 2005 Plan. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Second Amendment to Range Resources Corporation Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Based Compensation Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
