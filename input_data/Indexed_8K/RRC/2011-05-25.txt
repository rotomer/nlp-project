The Company may act as Registrar or (except for purposes of Article 8) Paying Agent. In each case the Company and the Trustee will enter into an appropriate agreement with the Agent implementing the provisions of the Indenture relating to the obligations of the Trustee to be performed by the Agent and the related rights. The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent.
     (b) The Company will require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or of interest on the Securities and will promptly notify the Trustee of any Default by the Company in making any such payment. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and account for any funds disbursed, and the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any payment Default, upon written request to a Paying Agent, require the Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed.

If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or if a Holder claims that its Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company will issue and the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Security of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. Every replacement Security is an additional Obligation of the Company and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity must be furnished that is sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company and the Trustee from any loss they may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company may charge the Holder for the expenses of the Company and the Trustee in replacing a Security. In case the mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may pay the Security instead of issuing a replacement Security.

     (b) A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its Affiliates holds the Security, , that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Securities have given or taken any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action hereunder, Securities owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, (it being understood that in determining whether the Trustee is protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, only Securities which the Trustee actually knows to be so owned will be so disregarded). Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company or any Affiliate of the Company.
provided
     Section 2.08 . Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee will authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities will be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have insertions, substitutions, omissions and other variations determined to be appropriate by the Company Officer executing the temporary Securities, as evidenced by the execution of the temporary Securities.

Transfers of a Global Security (but not a beneficial interest therein) will be limited to transfers thereof in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees, except (x) as set forth in Section 2.11(b)(4) and (y) transfers of portions thereof in the form of Certificated Securities may be made upon request of an Agent Member (for itself or on behalf of a beneficial owner) by written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures of the Depositary and in compliance with this Section 2.11.
 
          (3) Agent Members will have no rights under the Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, and the Depositary shall be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary or its nominee may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person (including any Agent Member and any Person that holds a beneficial interest in a Global Security through an Agent Member) to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Securities, and nothing herein will impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any security.
          (4) If (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for a Global Security and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the notice or (y) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee has received a request from the Depositary, the Trustee will promptly exchange each beneficial interest in the Global Security for one or more Certificated Securities in authorized denominations having an equal aggregate principal amount registered in the name of the owner of such beneficial interest, as identified to the Trustee by the Depositary, and thereupon the Global Security will be deemed canceled. Each Certificated Security will be registered in the name of the Holder thereof or its nominee.
     (c) A Holder may transfer a Security to another Person or exchange a Security for another Security or Securities of any authorized denomination by presenting to the Trustee a written request therefor stating the name of the proposed transferee or requesting such an exchange. The Registrar will promptly register any transfer or exchange that meets the requirements of this Section by noting the same in the Register maintained by the Registrar for the purpose; , that
provided
          (x) no transfer or exchange will be effective until it is registered in such Register and
          (y) the Trustee will not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or repurchased, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption or repurchase in whole or in part, except, in the case of a partial redemption or repurchase, that portion of any Security not being redeemed or repurchased, or (iii) if a redemption or a repurchase is to occur after a regular record date but on or before the corresponding related interest payment date, to register the transfer of or exchange any Security on or after the regular record date and before the date of redemption or repurchase. Prior to the registration of any transfer, the Company, the Trustee and their agents will treat the Person in whose name the Security is registered as the owner and Holder thereof for all purposes (whether or not the Security is overdue), and will not be affected by notice to the contrary.
     From time to time the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate additional Securities as necessary in order to permit the registration of a transfer or exchange in accordance with this Section.
     No service charge will be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of any Security, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than a transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchange pursuant to subsection (b)(4)).

Any beneficial interest in one Global Security that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security, or exchanged for a beneficial interest in another Global Security, will, upon transfer or exchange, cease to be an owner of a beneficial interest in such Global Security and become an owner of a beneficial interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer and exchange restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest.
Global Security to Global Security
          (2) . If a beneficial interest in a Global Security is transferred or exchanged for a Certificated Security, the Trustee will (x) record a decrease in the principal amount of such

If a Certificated Security is transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security, the Trustee will (x) cancel such Certificated Security, (y) record an increase in the principal amount of such Global Security equal to the principal amount of such transfer or exchange and (z) in the event that such transfer or exchange involves less than the entire principal amount of the canceled Certificated Security, deliver to the Holder thereof one or more new Certificated Securities in authorized denominations having an aggregate principal amount equal to the untransferred or unexchanged portion of the canceled Certificated Security, registered in the name of the Holder thereof.

               (1) the holders of Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations in respect of such Senior Debt (including interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt, whether or not a claim for such interest would be allowed in such proceeding) before the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees shall be entitled to receive any payment or distribution with respect to the Guarantee made by such Subsidiary Guarantor (except in each case that Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees may receive securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.05 hereof provided, that the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture); and
               (2) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor (as provided in subsection (b)(1) above) are paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees would be entitled shall be made to holders of Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor (except that Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees may receive securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.05 hereof provided, that the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture).
     Under the circumstances described in this Section 10.03, the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar person making any payment or distribution of cash or other property or securities is authorized or instructed to make any payment or distribution to which the Holders of the Securities and the related Guarantees would otherwise be entitled (other than securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments made from any defeasance trust referred to in the second parenthetical clause of each of clauses (a)(1), (b)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2) above, which shall be delivered or paid to the Holders of Securities as set forth in such clauses) directly to the holders of the Senior Debt of the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Debt of the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, held by such holders) or their Representatives, or to any trustee or trustees under any other indenture pursuant to which any such Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests appear, to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior Debt in full, in cash or cash equivalents after giving effect to any concurrent payment, distribution or provision thereof or to or for the holders of such Senior Debt.
     To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Debt (whether by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Debt or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. To the extent the obligation to repay any Senior Debt is declared to be fraudulent, invalid or otherwise set aside under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then the obligation so declared
 
fraudulent, invalid or otherwise set aside (and all other amounts that would come due with respect thereto had such obligation not been so affected) shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as Senior Debt for all purposes hereof as if such declaration, invalidity or setting aside had not occurred.
     Section 10.04 . The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors may not make any payment (whether by redemption, purchase, retirements, defeasance or otherwise) upon or in respect of the Securities and the related Guarantees (other than securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to Senior Debt and any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt and payments and other distributions made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.05 hereof if the applicable deposit does not violate Article 8 or 10 of this Indenture) until all principal and other Obligations with respect to the Senior Debt of the Company have been paid in full if:
Default on Designated Senior Debt
          (i) a default in the payment of any principal of, premium, if any, or interest on Designated Senior Debt occurs; or
          (ii) any other default occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Debt that permits, or with the giving of notice or passage of time or both (unless cured or waived) would permit, holders of the Designated Senior Debt as to which such default relates to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "") from the Company or the holders of any Designated Senior Debt. If the Trustee receives any such Payment Blockage Notice, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until 360 days shall have elapsed since the date of commencement of the payment blockage period resulting from the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No nonpayment default in respect of any Designated Senior Debt that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice.
Payment Blockage Notice
     The Company shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Securities and any Subsidiary Guarantor shall resume making payments and distributions pursuant to the Guarantees upon:
               (1) in the case of a default referred to in Section 10.04(i) hereof the date upon which the default is cured or waived, or
               (2) in the case of a default referred to in Section 10.04(ii) hereof, the earliest of (1) the date on which such nonpayment default is cured or waived, (2) the date the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is retracted by written notice to the Trustee and (3) 90 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received unless (A) the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated (B) a Default or Event of Default under Section 6.01(9) or (10) has occurred and is continuing, if this Article otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment or acquisition.
or
     Section 10.05 . If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify holders of Senior Debt of the acceleration.
Acceleration of Securities
     Section 10.06 . In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives any payment or distribution of or in respect of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or the Guarantees at a time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 10.03 or Section 10.04 hereof, such payment or distribution shall be held by the Trustee (if the Trustee has actual knowledge that such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 10.03 or Section 10.04) or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered to, the holders of Senior Debt as their interests may appear or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which such Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt.
When Distribution Must be Paid Over
     With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and, except as provided in Section 10.12, shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders of Securities or the Company,
 
the Subsidiary Guarantors or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
     Section 10.07 . The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or the related Guarantees to violate this Article, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Securities and the related Guarantees to the Senior Debt as provided in this Article.
Notice by Company
     Section 10.08 . After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness with the Securities and the Guarantees) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that distributions and payments otherwise payable to the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt. A payment or distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees is not, as between the Company and Holders of Securities, a payment by the Company on the Securities.
Subrogation
pari passu
     Section 10.09 . This Article defines the relative rights of Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees and holders of Senior Debt. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
          (1) impair, as between the Company and Holders of Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Securities in accordance with their terms;
          (2) affect the relative rights of Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or
          (3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees.
     If the Company fails because of this Article to pay principal of or interest on a Security on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.
     Section 10.10 . No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as provided in this Article 10 will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of Senior Debt may have or otherwise be charged with. The provisions of this Article 10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of Senior Debt.
Subordination May Not be Impaired by Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors
     Section 10.11 . Whenever a payment or distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.
Payment, Distribution or Notice to Representative
     Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities and the related Guarantees for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10.
 
     Section 10.12 . Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Securities and the Guarantees, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least one Business Day prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Securities or Guarantees to violate this Article, which notice shall specifically refer to Section 10.03 or 10.04 hereof. Only the Company or a Representative may give the notice. Nothing in this Article 10 shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
     Section 10.13 . Each Holder by the Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 6.09 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, each lender under the Credit Agreement is hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Securities and the related Guarantees.
Authorization to Effect Subordination
     Section 10.14 . No amendment may be made to the provisions of or the definitions of any terms appearing in this Article 10, or to the provisions of Section 6.02 relating to the Designated Senior Debt, that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Debt (or any group or Representative authorized to give a consent) consent to such change.
Amendments
     Section 10.15 . Without in any way limiting the generality of Section 10.09 of this Indenture, the holders of Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring responsibility to the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article 10 or the obligations hereunder of the Holders to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding or secured; (b) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor and any other Person.
No Waiver of Subordination Provisions
     Section 11.01 . Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, on the Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on premium and interest, on the Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each of the
The Guarantees
 
Subsidiary Guarantors hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities and this Indenture. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, or any Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders of Securities in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors further agrees that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any Subsidiary Guarantor not paying so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantees.
     Section 11.02 . To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit B shall be endorsed by an officer of such Subsidiary Guarantor on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor by an Officer thereof.
Execution and Delivery of Guarantees
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such Guarantee.
     If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the applicable Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security on which such Guarantee is endorsed, such Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
     The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Subsidiary Guarantors.
     Section 11.03 . No Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the Surviving Person) another Person, whether or not affiliated with such Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:
Subsidiary Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms
          (a) subject to the provisions of Section 11.04 hereof, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee in respect of the Securities, this Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee;
          (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
          (c) such transaction does not violate any of Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16 and 4.17.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be permitted to consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), another corporation, Person or entity pursuant to the preceding sentence if such consolidation or merger would not be permitted by Section 5.01 hereof.
     In case of any such consolidation or merger and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Guarantee endorsed upon the Securities and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by such Subsidiary Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be
 
substituted for such Subsidiary Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Subsidiary Guarantor. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
     Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger of any Subsidiary Guarantor with or into the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of any Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor.
     Section 11.04 . In the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor or a sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of any Subsidiary Guarantor, to any corporation or other Person (including an Unrestricted Subsidiary) by way of merger, consolidation, or otherwise, in a transaction that does not violate any of the covenants of this Indenture, then such Subsidiary Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all the capital stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall be released and relieved of any obligations under its Guarantee and such acquiring corporation or other Person (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor), if other than a Subsidiary Guarantor, shall have no obligation to assume or otherwise become liable under such Guarantee. Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Guarantee and the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee.
Releases of Guarantees
ipso facto
     Any Subsidiary Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Securities and for the other obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Indenture as provided in this Article 11.
     Any Subsidiary Guarantor that is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Indenture shall be released from and relieved of its obligations under its Guarantee.
     Section 11.05 . For purposes hereof, each Subsidiary Guarantor's liability shall be that amount from time to time equal to the aggregate liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor thereunder, but shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the Obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture and (ii) the amount, if any, which would not have (A) rendered such Subsidiary Guarantor "" (as such term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code and in the Debtor and Creditor Law of the State of New York) or (B) left it with unreasonably small capital at the time its Guarantee of the Securities was entered into, after giving effect to the incurrence of existing Indebtedness immediately prior to such time; , that, it shall be a presumption in any lawsuit or other proceeding in which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party that the amount guaranteed pursuant to its Guarantee is the amount set forth in clause (i) above unless any creditor, or representative of creditors of such Subsidiary Guarantor, or debtor in possession or trustee in bankruptcy of such Subsidiary Guarantor, otherwise proves in such a lawsuit that the aggregate liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor is limited to the amount set forth in clause (ii). In making any determination as to the solvency or sufficiency of capital of a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the previous sentence, the right of such Subsidiary Guarantor to contribution from other Subsidiary Guarantors and any other rights such Subsidiary Guarantor may have, contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account.
Limitation on Subsidiary Guarantor Liability
insolvent
provided
     Section 11.06 . In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "" as used in Article 10 and this Article 11 shall in such case (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully and for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in Article 10 and this Article 11 in place of the Trustee.

Trustee
 
     Section 11.07 . The obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors under its Guarantee pursuant to this Article 11 shall be junior and subordinated to the Senior Debt of the Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article 10 hereof. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the Trustee and the Holders shall have the right to receive and/or retain payments or distributions by or on behalf of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors only at such times as they may receive and/or retain payments in respect of the Securities pursuant to this Indenture, including Article 10 hereof.
Subordination of Guarantees
     Section 12.01 . If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by TIA  318(c), the imposed duties shall control.

Communication by Holders of Securities with Other Holders of Securities
     Section 12.04 . Upon any request or application by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Trustee to take any action under this Indenture, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, shall furnish to the Trustee:

          (b) an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (which shall include the statements set forth in Section 12.05 hereof) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent and covenants have been complied with.

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Securities, by accepting a Security, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.

Indenture
     The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors to the Holders of Securities and to the Trustee pursuant to this Guarantee and the Indenture (including the subordination provisions thereof) are expressly set forth in Article 11 of the Indenture, and reference is hereby made to such Indenture for the precise terms of this Guarantee. The terms of Article 11 of the Indenture are incorporated herein by reference.
     This is a continuing Guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding upon each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and its respective successors and assigns to the extent set forth in the Indenture until full and final payment of all of the Company's Obligations under the Securities and the Indenture and shall inure to the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and their successors and assigns and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder of Securities or the Trustee, the rights and privileges herein conferred upon that party shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor that satisfies the provisions of Section 11.04 of the Indenture shall be released of its obligations hereunder. This is a Guarantee of payment and not a, guarantee of collection.
     This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Security upon which this Guarantee is noted shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers.
     For purposes hereof, each Subsidiary Guarantor's liability will be that amount from time to time equal to the aggregate liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder but shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of the obligations of the Company under the Securities and the Indenture and (ii) the amount, if any, which would not have (A) rendered such Subsidiary Guarantor "insolvent" (as such term is defined in the federal Bankruptcy Code and in the Debtor and Creditor law of the State of New York) or (B) left it with unreasonably small capital at the time its Guarantee was entered into, after giving effect to the incurrence of existing Indebtedness immediately prior to such time; provided, that, it shall be a presumption in any lawsuit or other proceeding in which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party that the amount guaranteed pursuant to its Guarantee is the amount set forth in clause (i) above unless any creditor, or representative of creditors of such Subsidiary Guarantor, or debtor in possession or trustee in bankruptcy of such Subsidiary Guarantor, otherwise proves in such a lawsuit that the aggregate liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor is limited to the amount set forth in clause (ii). The Indenture provides that, in making any determination as to the solvency or sufficiency of capital of a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the previous sentence, the right of such Subsidiary Guarantor to contribution from other Subsidiary Guarantors and any other rights such Subsidiary Guarantor may have, contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account.

From and after June 1, 2016, the Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1 of the years indicated below:
     (b) Prior to June 1, 2014 the Company may, at its option, on any one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.750% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date, with the net proceeds of sales of public Equity Interests of the Company; that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of Notes remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and provided, further, that any such redemption shall occur within 60 days after the date of the closing of the related sale of such Equity Interests.

United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the redemption date to June 1, 2016 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
     If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.
     4. .
Mandatory Redemption

     8. . The registered Holder of a Note shall be treated as its owner for all purposes.
Persons Deemed Owners
     9. . Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or the tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default under, or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended on supplemented to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder, or to comply with the requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
     10. . The Indenture provides that if an Event of Default (other than with respect to bankruptcy events) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
Defaults and Remedies
     11. . The Notes are subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company as provided in the Indenture. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Debt must be paid before the Notes may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, and any other payment Obligation of the Company in respect of the Notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture, to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt of the Company (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed) and authorizes the Trustee to give effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose.
Subordination
     12. . The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue or resign.
Trustee Dealings with Company
 
     13. . No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
No Recourse Against Others

FORT WORTH, TEXAS, MAY 25, 2011...RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC)
Range intends to execute later today supplemental indentures (the "Supplemental Indentures") with respect to each of the indentures governing the Notes, which will eliminate most of the covenants and certain default provisions applicable to the Notes. Each Supplemental Indenture will not become operative until a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes has been purchased by Range pursuant to the terms of the Offers, which is expected to occur today.
Range's obligation to accept for purchase, and to pay for, any Notes pursuant to the Offers is subject to a number of conditions that are set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including the closing today of Range's previously announced public offering of $500,000,000 of 5-3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2021. The "Total Consideration" for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Consent Expiration is $1,023.75 with respect to the 2015 Notes and $1,040.00 with respect to the 2016 Notes, each of which includes a consent payment of $20.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment on the applicable Notes.
Holders who validly tender (and do not validly withdraw) their Notes after the Consent Expiration and prior to the expiration of the Offers will be entitled to receive consideration equal to $1,003.75 for each $1,000 principal amount of 2015 Notes and $1,020.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of 2016 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes up to, but not including, the payment date for such Notes accepted for purchase. Holders of Notes tendered after the Consent Expiration will not receive a consent payment. The tender offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City Time, on Wednesday, June 8, 2011, unless extended by Range in its sole discretion.
Any Notes not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offers will remain outstanding and the holders will be subject to the terms of the Supplemental Indentures even though they did not consent to the amendments.
Range has engaged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to act as the exclusive dealer manager and solicitation agent in connection with the Offers. Questions regarding the terms of the Offers may be directed to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Syndicate Desk, at (800) 261-5767 (US toll-free). The complete terms and conditions of the Offers are described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated May 11, 2011, copies of which may be obtained from MacKenzie Partners Inc., the depositary and information agent for the Offers, at (800) 322-2885 (US toll free).
 
This press release does not constitute an offer to purchase the Notes or a solicitation of consents to amend the related indenture. The tender offers are made solely pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated May 11, 2011.
