ITEM 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
99.1 Press Release dated January 17, 2012
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
FORT WORTH, TEXAS, JANUARY 17, 2012
today provided information on production volumes, price realizations and its hedging position. Fourth quarter 2011 production volumes averaged 625 Mmcfe per day, a record high for Range. Fourth quarter 2011 production increased 16% over the prior-year period and was 16% higher than third quarter 2011. Production for full-year 2011 averaged 554 Mmcfe per day, a 12% increase over 2010. This represents Range's eighth consecutive year of double-digit production growth. Adjusting for the sale of the Barnett properties at the end of April 2011, the 12% production growth in 2011 would have been 36%.
RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC)
The Company announced its preliminary fourth quarter 2011 natural gas, NGLs and oil price realizations (including the impact of cash-settled hedges and derivative settlements which would correspond to analysts' estimates) averaged $5.44 per mcfe. This represents a 2% increase from the prior-year period. Production and preliminary realized prices by each commodity for the fourth quarter were: natural gas  491 Mmcfe per day ($4.14), natural gas liquids  16,931 barrels per day ($54.31) and crude oil  5,409 barrels per day ($83.71).
During the fourth quarter, Range increased its commodity hedge position. The Company currently has approximately 75% of its anticipated natural gas production for 2012 hedged at a weighted average floor of $4.45 per Mmbtu, net of premium payments. In addition, Range has a material portion of its 2013 anticipated natural gas production hedged at a floor price of $4.73 per Mmbtu. Range's updated hedge position is shown in the table below.
Commenting on the announcement, Jeff L. Ventura, Range's President and CEO, said, "Our fourth quarter production results exceeded guidance. Achieving our eighth year of double-digit production growth, despite selling our Barnett properties in April, is a terrific accomplishment by our team. With a significant portion of our 2012 and 2013 natural gas hedged, we are well positioned to continue to generate attractive returns during this period of low natural gas prices. Our large inventory of high-return, liquid-rich projects, low cost structure and strong financial position, provides us substantial flexibility as we continue to focus on creating value per share for our shareholders."
 
The information in this release is unaudited. Audited and final results, including final fourth quarter 2011 product price realizations (including the impact of cash-settled hedges and derivative settlements) will be provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 currently planned to be filed with Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of February or early March 2012.
