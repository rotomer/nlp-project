ITEM 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On March 29, 2012, Range Resources Corporation (the "Company") received a reprimand letter as a result of a violation of Sections 204.21 and 401.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. The violation occurred as a result of an inadvertent data entry error with regard to the record date for the Company's 2012 proxy statement in the New York Stock Exchange's ("NYSE") online corporate governance system. The Company inadvertently and incorrectly reported a record date of March 23, 2012 when the actual record date for voting at the Company's 2012 annual meeting is March 26, 2012 (the next business day after March 23, 2012). The rules of the NYSE require at least 10 days prior notice of the setting of a record date and the error was not discovered until March 26, 2012. The Company gave notice to NYSE of the error immediately upon discovery but the Company acknowledges that such notice was not at least 10 days prior to the actual record date and that a technical violation of the rule occurred.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: March 30, 2012
