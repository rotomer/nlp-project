CHICAGO, May 7, 2003 RR Donnelley (NYSE: DNY) today announced first quarter 2003 earnings per diluted share of 5 cents, compared to 20 cents in the year ago period. Revenues for the first quarter were $1.1 billion, down 2 percent compared to the prior year. Net income was $6 million, compared to $23 million in the first quarter of 2002.
 
Included in the above results for the first quarter of 2003 are restructuring and impairment charges of $3 million ($2 million after-tax, or 1 cent per diluted share). In the year-earlier period, results included restructuring and impairment charges of $27 million ($17 million after-tax, or 14 cents per diluted share), and a $30 million reversal of excess tax reserves ($30 million benefit after-tax, or 26 cents per diluted share), related to the company's settlement with the IRS on deductibility of interest payments for corporate-owned life insurance.
 
"We're on track with our full-year earnings guidance," said William L. Davis, RR Donnelley's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "I'm particularly pleased that we're not only delivering results today, we're also building sales momentum that will pay off for years to come."
 
The company continued to experience a weak environment in its print businesses, as well as continued weakness in domestic capital markets activity. The company's logistics business continued its strong revenue growth, aided by the March acquisition of Momentum Logistics. Growth in Europe and Asia also contributed to the company's performance. The company continued to benefit from prior restructuring efforts and ongoing productivity programs, partially mitigating the company's print revenue decline.

The company also affirmed its previously issued full year earnings guidance of $1.25 to $1.40 per diluted share. This range includes six cents per diluted share for expected restructuring activity. The company's guidance continues to incorporate the weak print demand and pricing environment, offset by continued cost reduction and productivity efforts. Capital spending is expected to be below $250 million, also unchanged from prior guidance.
