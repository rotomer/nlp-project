4.1 Issuance of Certificates Representing Parent Common Stock
 
At or as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent SubCo shall deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares who will receive Parent Common Stock in connection with the Arrangement, certificates representing the Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) issuable under the Arrangement. Upon surrender to the Depositary for transfer to Parent SubCo of a certificate which immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time represented Company Common Shares in respect of which the holder is entitled to receive Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) under the Arrangement, together with a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer of the Company Common Shares formerly represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of the Company, and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and after the Effective Time the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing that number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) which such holder has the right to receive (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3) and any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be transferred to Parent SubCo. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, payable to holders of certificates that formerly represented Company Common Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that was not registered in the securities register of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to the transferee if the certificate representing such Company Common Shares is presented to the Depositary as provided above, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time represented one or more Company Common Shares, under the Arrangement, that were exchanged or were deemed to be exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) pursuant to Section 2.2(b) shall be deemed at all times at and after the Effective Time, but subject to Section 4.5, to
 
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) which such holder has the right to receive as contemplated by this Section 4.1, (ii) a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 4.3, and (iii) any dividends or distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofor paid or payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 4.2.
 
4.2 Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates
 
No dividends or other distributions paid, declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares that were exchanged for Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(b) unless and until the holder of such certificate shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.1. Subject to applicable law, at the time such holder shall have complied with the provisions of Section 4.1 (or, in the case of clause (iii) below, at the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares, without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.3, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofor paid with respect to the Parent Common Stock, to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto and (iii) on the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the date of compliance by such holder with the provisions of Section 4.1 and a payment date subsequent to the date of such compliance and payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock.
 
4.3 No Fractional Shares
 
No certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon compliance with the provisions of Section 4.1 and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital structure of Parent shall relate to any such fractional security and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to exercise any rights as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional securities, each holder otherwise entitled to a share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive a cash payment in United States currency from the Depositary equal to the product of such fractional interest and the Closing Trading Price of Parent Common Stock, such amount to be provided to the Depositary by Parent SubCo upon request. Such payment with respect to fractional shares is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not separately bargained for, consideration. If more than one certificate formerly representing Company Common Shares are surrendered for the account of the same holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock for which such certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Company Common Shares represented by the certificates so surrendered.
 
4.4 Lost Certificates
 
In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Company Common Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(b) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of Company Common Shares claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, one or more certificates representing one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) pursuant to Section 4.1 and such holders Letter of Transmittal, in each case deliverable in accordance with Section 2.2, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.3. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the holder to whom certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo, and their respective transfer agents in such sum as the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo may direct or otherwise indemnify the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo in a manner satisfactory to the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo against any claim that may be made against the Company, Parent and Parent SubCo with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
 
4.5 Extinguishment of Rights
 
Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares that are not held by a Dissenting Shareholder who is ultimately entitled to be paid fair value of the Company Common Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder, but was exchanged or was deemed to have been exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(b), that has not been deposited with all other instruments required by Section 4.1, on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature to Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights). On such date, shares of Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) to which the former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to Parent SubCo, together with all entitlements to dividends, distributions, cash and interest in respect thereof held for such former holder. None of Parent, Parent SubCo, the Company or the Depositary shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Common Stock (and associated Parent Rights) (or dividends, distributions and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares) delivered to a public official pursuant to and in compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
 
4.6 Withholding Rights
 
The Company, Parent, Parent SubCo, and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Shares, or Parent Common Stock, such amounts as the Company,
 
Parent or Parent SubCo or the Depositary is required or entitled to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the Code or any provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion, if any, of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, the Company, Parent, Parent SubCo and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of, on behalf of such holder, such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to the Company, Parent or Parent SubCo or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the Company, Parent, Parent SubCo or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the proceeds of such sale less any costs or expenses incurred by the Company, Parent, Parent SubCo or the Depositary in connection with such sale.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I have been advised that as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Moore Wallace Incorporated (the "Company"), as such term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Combination Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2003 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the "Combination Agreement"), among the Company and R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company ("Parent"), the Company and Parent will be combined. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Combination Agreement.
 
I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Combination Agreement will be exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act. I have also been advised, however, that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Combination Agreement is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, my ability to sell, assign or transfer any Parent Common Stock that I receive in exchange for any shares of common stock of the Company ("Company Common Stock") pursuant to the Combination Agreement may be restricted unless such sale, assignment or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are limited and I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such Securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act.
 
I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with Parent that I will not sell, assign or transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) by a sale made in conformity
 
with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 (and otherwise in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of Parent and if so required at the time) or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. In the event of a sale of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, I will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of customary seller's and broker's Rule 145 representation letters or as Parent may otherwise reasonably request.
 
I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of the shares of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as a result of the Combination Agreement.
 
I acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to me or held by a transferee thereof, which legends will be removed if (i) one year shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received pursuant to the Combination Agreement and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then applicable to me, (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received pursuant to the Combination Agreement and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to me, or (iii) Parent has received either an opinion of independent counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act no longer apply to me.
 
I further understand and agree that Parent may instruct the registrar for Parent Common Stock not to register the transfer of any Parent Common Stock held by me unless any such transfer is made in accordance with this letter agreement.
 
Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
 
This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Parent and me concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts to be performed wholly in the State of New York.
 
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to the undersigned, at which time this letter shall become a binding agreement between us.

R.R. DONNELLEY & SONS COMPANY
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
November 9, 2003RR Donnelley (NYSE: DNY) and Moore Wallace Incorporated (NYSE/TSX: MWI) today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement to create the world's premier full-service commercial printer with over $8 billion in annual revenues, a leading position in North America and approximately 50,000 employees worldwide. The combined company will provide customers with the industry's broadest array of high-quality, long- and short-run print products and solutions, from magazines, telephone directories, books, catalogs, inserts and financial documents, to billing statements, outsourced customer communications, highly personalized direct mail, premedia, print fulfillment, labels, collateral materials, forms and logistics services. The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the agreement.
Chicago, Toronto and New York
The combined company will retain the RR Donnelley name and will be headquartered in Chicago. Upon closing of the transaction, Mark A. Angelson, Chief Executive Officer of Moore Wallace, will become CEO of the new RR Donnelley, succeeding William L. Davis, Chairman, President and CEO of RR Donnelley. Mr. Davis announced in July 2003 his intention to retire when a successor was identified. Longtime RR Donnelley Director Stephen M. Wolf is to become non-executive Chairman of the Board of the combined company.
Under the terms of the transaction, Moore Wallace shareholders will receive RR Donnelley shares based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.63 of a RR Donnelley share for each Moore Wallace share. This represents $US17.66 in value per Moore Wallace share, or approximately $2.8 billion in total equity value, a premium of 16%, based on the closing stock prices of both companies on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on
 
Friday, November 7, 2003. RR Donnelley will assume approximately $900 million in Moore Wallace debt.
The combined company will be traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol DNY. Upon completion of the transaction, RR Donnelley and Moore Wallace shareholders will own, respectively, approximately 53% and 47% of the combined company. RR Donnelley is expected to maintain an investment grade credit rating and to maintain its annual dividend of $1.04 per share. RR Donnelley and Moore Wallace will contribute eight and seven directors, respectively, to the combined Board.
The transaction is expected to be accretive to RR Donnelley's earnings in the first full year of operations, excluding the impact of transaction-related charges. In addition to significantly enhanced revenue opportunities, the combined company expects to generate cost savings of at least $100 million on an annualized basis in the first 12-24 months after the closing. These savings are anticipated to result from the elimination of duplicative administrative and infrastructure costs, reduction in procurement expenses, and asset rationalization. The combined company is also expected to generate substantial cash flow in the first year of consolidated operations.
William L. Davis, Chairman, President and CEO of RR Donnelley, said, "Today's announcement is a tremendously positive step forward in the continued evolution and development of RR Donnelley. The transaction will place the new RR Donnelley among the Fortune 250. It is great news for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. I am especially pleased that Mark Angelson will be leading this company and look forward to a smooth transition."
Mark A. Angelson, CEO of Moore Wallace, said, "This transaction is strategically and financially compelling, bringing together the industry's most established and highly regarded companies and the industry's most advanced technologies to create a dynamic new business platform. The combination will enable the new RR Donnelley to offer the world's leading companies a comprehensive suite of print and related products and solutions that will meet the demands of our growing customer base. Through this combination, the new RR Donnelley will serve leading global, national, regional and
 
local customers and will provide every printing need a company of any size could require."
 
Mr. Angelson continued, "With a broad base of highly profitable businesses and a strategic approach to managing our capital, the new RR Donnelley will generate substantial cash flow after servicing the dividend and making disciplined capital expenditures. We will continue our commitment to use that cash flow on an accretive basis."
 
Stephen M. Wolf, a Director of RR Donnelley, said, "Together, these two storied companies will have the scale and financial strength to compete successfully well into the future. Mark is a highly respected and superb leader with a solid track record in delivering growth and shareholder value, while maintaining a strong focus on customer satisfaction. The Board and I believe that he is the right person to take the combined company forward and deliver on its promise to all of its constituencies. I very much look forward to working with him in the years ahead."
 
Alfred C. Eckert III, Chairman of the Moore Wallace Board, said, "We have created considerable equity for our shareholders and the prospects are excellent for continuing to build significant value. I am enthusiastic about this transaction and its potential. I look forward to serving on the Board of the new RR Donnelley and to chairing its newly-created Executive Committee."
 
The transaction is subject to approval by RR Donnelley stockholders and Moore Wallace shareholders, and Ontario court approval of a plan of arrangement, which will provide for the compulsory exchange of each outstanding share of Moore Wallace for 0.63 of a RR Donnelley share. In addition, the transaction is subject to anti-trust clearance and Investment Canada approval, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2004. The transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected to be taxable to Canadian shareholders of Moore Wallace.

Moore Wallace. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP provided legal counsel to Moore Wallace.
