In assessing any liabilities, damages or other amounts recoverable by the Buyer as a result of any Warranty Claim relating to a breach of any Business Warranty, there shall be taken into account (i) any benefit accruing to the Buyer's Group (including,

without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any amount of any Tax relief obtained or obtainable by the Buyer's Group and any amount by which any Tax for which the Buyer's Group is or may be liable to be assessed or accountable is reduced or extinguished), arising directly or indirectly in consequence of the matter which gives rise to such Warranty Claim and also (ii) any liability, including any Tax payable (and not recoverable within one year) in respect of such damages or amounts recoverable.
 
 
No liability will arise and no Warranty Claim relating to a breach of any Business Warranty, may be made to the extent that the matter giving rise to such Warranty Claim is remediable unless, within the period of thirty (30) days following the Buyer becoming aware of such matter, the Buyer shall have given written notice thereof to the Management Sellers, on behalf of the Warrantors, and such matter shall not have been remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer within such period of thirty (30) days.

The Buyer is not entitled to recover damages or otherwise obtain payment, reimbursement or restitution to the extent that it has already obtained payment, reimbursement or restitution in respect of the same loss or liability.
 
 
If any potential Warranty Claim relating to a breach of any Business Warranty arises as a result of a contingent or unquantifiable liability of the Buyer or any member of the Buyer's Group, the Warrantors will not be obliged to pay any sum in respect of that potential Warranty Claim until the liability either ceases to be contingent or becomes quantifiable.
 
 
The liability of the Warrantors to the Buyer in respect of any Business Warranty relating to any Group Company will cease, and any subsisting Warranty Claim relating to any such Warranty will be withdrawn, upon the relevant Group Company ceasing to be a subsidiary undertaking of the Buyer or upon a change of control (involving a change in ownership of fifty (50) per cent. or more of the shares carrying voting rights) of the Buyer.

Nothing in clause 5, clause 6 or this Schedule 5 shall or shall be deemed or construed in any way to relieve, restrict or limit the Buyer's or the relevant member of the Buyer's Group common law duty to mitigate any loss or damage incurred by it or them.
