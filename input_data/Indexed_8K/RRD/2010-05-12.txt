Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company and Bowne & Co., Inc. each received a request for additional information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") with respect to the previously announced proposed acquisition by RR Donnelley of Bowne. The request for information from the FTC, often referred to as a "second request," is part of the regulatory process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("HSR Act"). RR Donnelley intends to respond expeditiously to this request and continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in connection with this review. Completion of the transaction remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and other customary closing conditions. RR Donnelley continues to expect the transaction to close during the second half of 2010.
