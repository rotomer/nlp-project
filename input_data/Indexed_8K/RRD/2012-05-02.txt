First-quarter 2011 net earnings attributable to common shareholders included pre-tax charges for restructuring ($42.7 million) and impairment ($8.1 million, non-cash) and acquisition-related expenses ($0.4 million).
CHICAGO, May 2, 2012  R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (NASDAQ: RRD)
The Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures, are useful because that information is an appropriate measure for evaluating the Company's operating performance. Internally, the Company uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business performance, and evaluates management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. These measures should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net earnings attributable to common shareholders totaled $78.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $68.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011. First-quarter non-GAAP net earnings attributable to common shareholders exclude restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses for both years as well as the loss on debt extinguishment in 2012. For non-GAAP comparison purposes, the effective tax rate decreased to 29.3% in the first quarter of 2012 from 32.7% in the first quarter of 2011, resulting from a release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets within Europe. A reconciliation of GAAP net earnings attributable to common shareholders to non-GAAP net earnings attributable to common shareholders is presented in the attached schedules.
"We are pleased with our first-quarter results," said Thomas J. Quinlan III, RR Donnelley's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The revenue trend improved from the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting a favorable trend in customer demand and new customer wins that we added to the platform during the quarter. We expect this improved trend, in conjunction with our continuing cost management efforts, to have a positive impact going forward."

Business Review
The Company reports its results in two reportable segments: 1) U.S. Print and Related Services and 2) International. The Company reports as Corporate its unallocated expenses associated with general and administrative activities.
Summary
Net sales in the quarter were $2.5 billion, down $58.6 million, or 2.3%, from the first quarter of 2011. Pro forma for acquisitions, net sales decreased 2.7%, due to volume declines in certain product offerings, price erosion and a 76 basis point unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an adjustment to accounts receivable for prior periods' over-accruals of rebates owed to certain customers within the office products reporting unit. Gross margin of 23.0% in the first quarter of 2012 declined from 24.3% in the first quarter of 2011 as an unfavorable product mix, pricing pressure and the reinstatement of the Company's 401k plan match more than offset lower pension expense and the impact of the rebate adjustment. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 2012 improved to 11.2% from 12.7% in the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to productivity improvements as well as lower pension and variable compensation expenses. Operating earnings of $121.4 million, which were impacted by restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses totaling $50.3 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to operating earnings of $109.4 million in the first quarter of 2011, which included restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses totaling $51.2 million.
Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses, non-GAAP operating margin improved to 6.8% in the first quarter of 2012 from 6.2% in the first quarter of 2011. Lower pension expense, the customer rebate adjustment, lower depreciation and amortization, productivity improvements and lower variable compensation expense more than offset an unfavorable product mix and continued pricing pressure.
Segments
Net sales for the U.S. Print and Related Services segment decreased 3.1% from the first quarter of 2011 to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Pro forma for acquisitions, net sales in the segment decreased 3.6%, as volume declines in books and directories, variable print and financial print, lower pass-through paper sales and continued pricing pressure across the segment more than offset the customer rebate adjustment and volume increases in logistics. The segment's operating income of $139.2 million in the first quarter of 2012, which was negatively impacted by charges for restructuring and impairment of $39.7 million, decreased $2.7 million from operating income of $141.9 million in the first quarter of 2011, which included charges for restructuring and impairment of $38.2 million. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin of 9.5% in the first quarter of 2012 improved 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2011, as productivity improvements, the customer rebate adjustment, lower depreciation and amortization, and lower variable compensation expense more than offset volume declines, an unfavorable product mix, pricing pressure and a lower recovery on by-products.
Net sales for the International segment of $643.5 million increased slightly from the first quarter of 2011. Volume growth in business process outsourcing, Asia and Latin America and higher pass-through paper sales in Europe were mostly offset by a $19.7 million (307 basis points) unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, volume declines in Europe and the impact of continued pricing pressure across the segment. The segment's operating income of

$30.6 million in the first quarter of 2012, which was negatively impacted by charges for restructuring and impairment of $5.4 million, decreased $13.5 million from operating income of $44.1 million in the first quarter of 2011, which included charges for restructuring and impairment of $9.2 million. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin declined to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2012 from 8.3% in the first quarter of 2011 as pricing pressure, wage and other inflationary increases in certain countries and an unfavorable product mix were only partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and lower variable compensation expense.
Unallocated Corporate operating expenses decreased to $48.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $76.6 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding charges for restructuring and impairment and acquisition-related expenses totaling $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2011, unallocated Corporate operating expenses decreased $29.6 million to $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2012. Lower pension expense, a lower provision for bad debt, productivity improvements and lower variable compensation expense were partially offset by the reinstatement of the 401k match and higher benefits-related expense.
Outlook2012 Full-Year Guidance
For the full year of 2012, the Company continues to project non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.92. This guidance assumes no additional shares are repurchased pursuant to the current authorization from the Company's board of directors. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be in the range of 29% to 32%. GAAP net earnings per diluted share in 2012 may include restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition-related expenses, the resolution of certain tax items and other items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant. For that reason, the Company is unable to provide full-year GAAP net earnings estimates at this time. In addition, the Company continues to project 2012 operating cash flow less capital expenditures of at least $500 million.
