R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (the "Company"), as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"), as guarantors, have entered into a $1.15 billion secured revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), dated as of October 15, 2012, among the Company, the Guarantors, the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"). Bank of America, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank National Association acted as co-syndication agents for the Credit Agreement. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as joint lead arrangers and joint book runners for the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement expires October 15, 2017, at which time all outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement will be due and payable. The Credit Agreement is available for borrowings by the Company if certain conditions precedent to each borrowing are met, including that (i) no event of default having occurred and being continuing and (ii) that the representations and warranties made in the Credit Agreement (other than the representation with respect to material adverse changes) are correct in all material respects.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured by a pledge of the stock of certain of the Company's subsidiaries and a security interest in certain current assets and real property of the Company and its subsidiaries. Under the security documents for the pledges and security interests, the aggregate amount of obligations secured by Principal Property (as defined in the Company's indentures) or any shares of capital stock or indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Company's indentures) has been limited so that, at no time, will it exceed the amount of indebtedness that may be secured without requiring holders of notes or debentures issued under those indentures to be equally and ratably secured by the same property in accordance with the terms of the indentures.
The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's previous credit agreement, dated as of December 17, 2010, among the Company, the banks party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Existing Credit Agreement"). All amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement were repaid with borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
Any borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate dependent on the credit facility's credit ratings at the time of such borrowing and will be calculated according to a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin, as the case may be. The Company must pay interest on borrowings not less often than quarterly. In addition, the Company must pay facility commitment fees quarterly in arrears at rates dependent on the credit facility's credit ratings. The applicable margin and rate for the facility commitment are set at agreed pricing levels until April 15, 2013 and will thereafter fluctuate dependent on the credit facility's credit ratings.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not less than 3.0 to 1 and (ii) a leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, that must be maintained at a level of not greater than 3.75 to 1 from the Closing Date through and including December 31, 2014 and at a level not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 thereafter. The financial covenants are each determined on a pro forma basis, as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default that are subject, in certain cases, to customary grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any representation made by the Company proving to be incorrect, defaults relating to other indebtedness of at least $100,000,000 in the aggregate, certain insolvency and receivership events affecting the Company or its subsidiaries, judgments in excess of $100,000,000 in the aggregate being rendered against the Company or its subsidiaries, the acquisition of 35% or more by any person of any outstanding class of capital stock having ordinary voting power in the election of directors of the Company, the incurrence of certain ERISA liabilities, and any collateral document ceasing to maintain the first priority lien contemplated thereby in an amount in excess of $50,000,000.
In the event of a default by the Company, the Administrative Agent may, and at the direction of the requisite number of Lenders will, terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the Credit Agreement, declare the obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and enforce any and all rights of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement and related documents, including pursuing their rights against the collateral. For certain events of default related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of the Lenders are automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations become immediately due and payable.
Certain of the lenders, agents and other parties to the Credit Agreement, and their affiliates, have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking and other advisory services to the company and its subsidiaries. Such lenders, agents and other parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from the Company and its subsidiaries for such services.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

(I) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(II) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor form),

(C) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their FATCA obligations, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's FATCA obligations and, if necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any documentation it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall promptly update such documentation or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its inability to do so.

Section 3.01(e)
(f) . Unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or any L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Company an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by any Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Company, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Company (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Company pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been if the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund had never been imposed.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
SECTION 3.02 .
Illegality
If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Base Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Base Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case, until
 
such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all of such Lender's Eurocurrency Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary, to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Base Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Base Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Base Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Base Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
SECTION 3.03 .
Inability to Determine Rates
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or in connection with a Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Base Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Base Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case, until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
SECTION 3.04 .

(ii) subject any Lender or any L/C Issuer to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of Taxation of payments to such Lender or such L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnifiable under and any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer); or
Section 3.01
(iii) impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Base Rate (or, in the case of paragraph (ii), any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost
 
to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender shall be entitled to request compensation for increased costs or expenses described in this caused by a Change in Law due to Dodd-Frank and Basel III only to the extent it is the general practice or policy of such Lender to request such compensation from other borrowers under comparable facilities under similar circumstances.

(b)
 
the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (B) the Secured Parties may collect from it even if the Secured Parties, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, have destroyed any right it may have to collect from the Borrower.

These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon  580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

SECTION 8.4. .
Certain Sales of Pledged Collateral
(a) Each Pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in law, rules, regulations or orders of any Governmental Authority, the Administrative Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who meet the requirements of such Governmental Authority. Each Pledgor acknowledges that any such sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Administrative Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such restricted sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that, except as may be required by applicable law, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public sales.
(b) Each Pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act, and applicable state securities laws, the Administrative Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Securities Collateral and Investment Property, to limit purchasers to persons who will agree, among other things, to acquire such Securities Collateral or Investment Property for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Administrative Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act), and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Securities Collateral or Investment Property for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form of public sale requiring registration under the Securities Act or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Pledgor shall, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, cause any registration, qualification under or compliance with any Federal or state securities law or laws to be effected with respect to all or any part of the Securities Collateral as soon as practicable and at the sole cost and expense of the Pledgors. Each Pledgor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such qualification and compliance to be effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of such Securities Collateral including registration under the Securities Act (or any similar statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with all other requirements of any Governmental Authority. Each Pledgor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Administrative Agent to be kept advised in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, shall furnish to the Administrative Agent such number of prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents incident thereto as the Administrative Agent from time to time may request, and shall indemnify and shall cause the issuer of the Securities Collateral to indemnify the Administrative Agent and all others participating in the distribution of such Securities Collateral against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(d) If the Administrative Agent determines to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Securities Collateral or Investment Property, upon written request, the applicable Pledgor shall from time to time furnish to the Administrative Agent all such information as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order to determine the number of securities included in the Securities Collateral or Investment Property which may be sold by the Administrative Agent as exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from time to time in effect.
(e) Each Pledgor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, that the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this shall be specifically enforceable against such Pledgor, and such Pledgor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

All rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

The Administrative Agent shall have the right hereunder to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking action (including the release or substitution of the Pledged Collateral), in
 
accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement. The Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection herewith and shall not be liable for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith. Each Secured Party, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no right individually to realize upon any of the Pledged Collateral hereunder, it being understood and agreed by such Secured Party that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent may resign and a successor Administrative Agent may be appointed in the manner provided in the Credit Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent under this Agreement, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation, the provisions hereof shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement while it was the Administrative Agent.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Pledged Collateral in its possession if such Pledged Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity, accords its own property consisting of similar instruments or interests, it being understood that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Secured Parties shall have responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any Securities Collateral, whether or not the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters or (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any person with respect to any Pledged Collateral.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any written notice, statement, certificate, order or other document or any telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person, and, with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.
(d) If any item of Pledged Collateral also constitutes collateral granted to the Administrative Agent under any other deed of trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type, in the event of any conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of such other deed of trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type in respect of such collateral, the provisions of this Agreement shall control unless the other deed of trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type in respect of such collateral expressly states that such document.
(e) The Administrative Agent may rely on advice of counsel as to whether any or all UCC financing statements of the Pledgors need to be amended as a result of any of the changes described in of the Credit Agreement. If any Pledgor fails to provide information
Section 7.09
 
to the Administrative Agent about such changes on a timely basis, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable or responsible to any party for any failure to maintain a perfected security interest in such Pledgor's property constituting Pledged Collateral, for which the Administrative Agent needed to have information relating to such changes. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to inquire about such changes if any Pledgor does not inform the Administrative Agent of such changes, the parties acknowledging and agreeing that it would not be feasible or practical for the Administrative Agent to search for information on such changes if such information is not provided by any Pledgor.
SECTION 10.2. . If any Pledgor shall fail to perform any covenants contained in this Agreement in any material respect or if any representation or warranty on the part of any Pledgor contained herein shall be breached in any material respect, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) do the same or cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and may expend funds for such purpose; , , that the Administrative Agent shall in no event be bound to inquire into the validity of any tax, Lien, imposition or other obligation which such Pledgor fails to pay or perform as and when required hereby and which such Pledgor does not contest in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any and all reasonable and documented amounts so expended by the Administrative Agent shall be paid by the Pledgors in accordance with the provisions of of the Credit Agreement. Neither the provisions of this nor any action taken by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this shall prevent any such failure to observe any covenant contained in this Agreement nor any breach of representation or warranty from constituting an Event of Default. Each Pledgor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor, or otherwise, from time to time in the Administrative Agent's discretion, to take any action and to execute any instrument consistent with the terms of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement and the other Collateral Documents which the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof (but the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to and shall have no liability to such Pledgor or any third party for failure to so do or take action). The foregoing grant of authority is a power of attorney coupled with an interest and such appointment shall be irrevocable for the term hereof. Each Pledgor hereby ratifies all that such attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.

Concerning Mortgagee
(i) The Mortgagee has been appointed as Administrative Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The actions of the Mortgagee hereunder are subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Mortgagee shall have the right hereunder to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking action (including, without limitation, the release or substitution of the Mortgaged Property), in accordance with this Mortgage and the Credit Agreement. The Mortgagee may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection herewith and shall not be liable for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith. Each Secured Party, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no right individually to realize upon any of the Mortgaged Property hereunder, it being understood and agreed by such Secured Party that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Mortgagee for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of this Mortgage. The Mortgagee may resign and a successor Mortgagee may be appointed in the manner provided in the Credit Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Mortgagee by a successor Mortgagee, that successor Mortgagee shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Mortgagee under this Mortgage, and the retiring Mortgagee shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Mortgage. After any retiring Mortgagee's resignation, the provisions hereof shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Mortgage while it was the Mortgagee.
(ii) The Mortgagee shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Mortgaged Property in its possession if such Mortgaged Property is accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Mortgagee, in its individual capacity, accords its own property consisting of similar property, instruments or interests, it being understood that neither the Mortgagee nor any of the Secured Parties shall have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any person with respect to any Mortgaged Property.
(iii) The Mortgagee shall be entitled to rely upon any written notice, statement, certificate, order or other document or any telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person, and, with respect to all matters pertaining to this Mortgage and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.
(iv) With respect to any of its rights and obligations as a Lender, the Mortgagee shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder. The term "Lenders," "Lender" or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Mortgagee in its individual capacity as a Lender. The Mortgagee may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Mortgagor or any Affiliate of the Mortgagor to the same extent as if the Mortgagee were not acting as Collateral Agent.
(v) If any portion of the Mortgaged Property also constitutes collateral granted by any Loan Party to the Mortgagee to secure the Secured Obligations under any other deed of trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type, in the event of any conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of such other deed of trust, mortgage, security
 
agreement, pledge or instrument of any type in respect of such collateral, the Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, shall select which provision or provisions shall control, unless the Mortgaged Property to which such conflict relates constitutes personal property, in which case the provisions of the Security Agreement shall control.
(vi) The Mortgagee may rely on advice of counsel as to whether any or all UCC financing statements of the Mortgagor need to be amended as a result of any of the changes described in Section 7.09 of the Credit Agreement. If the Mortgagor fails to provide information to the Mortgagee about such changes on a timely basis, the Mortgagee shall not be liable or responsible to any party for any failure to maintain a perfected security interest in any portion of the Mortgaged Property, for which the Mortgagee needed to have information relating to such changes. The Mortgagee shall have no duty to inquire about such changes if the Mortgagor does not inform the Mortgagee of such changes, the parties acknowledging and agreeing that it would not be feasible or practical for the Mortgagee to search for information on such changes if such information is not provided by the Mortgagor.

Any and all reasonable and documented amounts so expended by the Mortgagee shall be paid by the Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.04 of the Credit Agreement. Neither the provisions of this nor any action taken by the Mortgagee pursuant to the provisions of this shall prevent any such failure to observe any covenant contained in this Mortgage nor any breach of representation or warranty from constituting an Event of Default. The Mortgagor hereby appoints the Mortgagee its attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in the place and stead of the Mortgagor and in the name of the Mortgagor, or otherwise, from time to time in the Mortgagee's discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument consistent with the terms of the Credit Agreement, this Mortgage and the other Collateral Documents which the Mortgagee may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof (but the Mortgagee shall not be obligated to and shall have no liability to the Mortgagor or any third party for failure to so do or take action). The foregoing grant of authority is a power of attorney coupled with an interest and such appointment shall be irrevocable for the term hereof.
