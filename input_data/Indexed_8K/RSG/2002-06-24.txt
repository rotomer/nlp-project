ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
On June 21, 2002, Republic Services, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed its independent certified public accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") and engaged the services of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as its new independent auditors for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2002, effective immediately. These actions followed the Company's decision to seek proposals from independent accountants to audit the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. The decision to dismiss Andersen and retain Ernst & Young was approved by the Company's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit and Nominating Committee.
None of the audit reports of Andersen on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion nor was any such audit report qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the subsequent interim period through June 21, 2002, there were no disagreements between the Company and Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports.
None of the reportable events described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K occurred within the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, or within the interim period through June 21, 2002.
A letter from Andersen to the Securities and Exchange Commission is attached as Exhibit 16.1.
During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the subsequent interim period through June 21, 2002, the Company did not consult with Ernst & Young regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
