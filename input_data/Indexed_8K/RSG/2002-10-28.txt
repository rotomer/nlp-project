FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Oct. 28, 2002...
For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, net income was $178.1 million, or $1.07 per share, versus net income of $164.4 million, or $0.96 per share, for the comparable period last year. Revenue increased 3.9 percent to $1,759.8 million from $1,694.0 million for the same period in 2001. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 was $341.4 million compared to operating income of $321.1 million for the same period last year.
In the first quarter of 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortizing intangibles with indefinite
 
lives effective January 1, 2002. If SFAS 142 had been effective January 1, 2001, net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001 would have been $63.5 million, or $0.37 per share, and $183.3 million, or $1.07 per share, respectively.
"While the economy shows no signs of improving, the Company's presence in higher growth markets together with its long-standing operational and financial strategies have allowed us to deliver 18 quarters of positive internal growth," said James E. O'Connor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, Inc. "Republic's operational focus, combined with our fiscal discipline, has us on track to exceed our original earnings guidance by between $0.03 and $0.04 and to achieve earnings at the upper end of our current $1.39 to $1.41 guidance. I am also pleased to announce that we are again increasing our free cash flow goal for 2002 to $160.0 million. We anticipate using these funds to create additional value for Republic's shareholders by continuing to acquire businesses when it makes economic sense to do so and by continuing our share repurchase program."

     The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001. It should also be read in conjunction with the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-Q as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2002.
CASH FLOW
     The following table reflects certain components of the Company's unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001 (in millions):
     The Company defines free cash flow as net income plus depreciation, amortization and depletion less capital expenditures plus net changes in assets and liabilities resulting from operating activities. This simple definition excludes certain commonly used elements of free cash flow such as deferred taxes and proceeds from the sale of equipment.
     In December 1999, the Company entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment. In July 2002, the Company exercised its right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. The Company's guidance for capital expenditures in previous years included equipment obtained through the operating lease facility. Accordingly, the payment made by the Company to terminate this facility has been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above.
     During the first quarter of 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortizing intangibles with indefinite lives effective January 1, 2002. If SFAS 142 had been effective January 1, 2001, amortization of intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001 would have been $1.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively.
     Capital expenditures include $.8 million and $1.1 million of capitalized interest for the three months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $1.8 million and $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
     As of September 30, 2002, accounts receivable were $249.7 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $19.7 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 37 (or 25 days net of deferred revenue).
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     During the nine months ended September 30, 2002, the Company paid $138.4 million to repurchase 7,383,900 shares of its stock of which $45.8 million was paid during the three months ended September 30, 2002 to repurchase 2,381,800 shares of stock. As of September 30, 2002, the Company had repurchased 16,597,500 shares of its stock for $288.5 million and had $11.5 million remaining under its 2002 repurchase program to fund stock repurchases.
     In October 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $150.0 million of its common stock.
