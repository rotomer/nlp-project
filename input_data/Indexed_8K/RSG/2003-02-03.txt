(NYSE: RSG) today reported that for the three months ended December 31, 2002, adjusted net income was $58.0 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $47.2 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same period in 2001. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2002 was $605.3 million compared to $563.5 million for the same period in 2001. Adjusted operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2002 was $112.5 million compared to adjusted operating income of $94.4 million for the same period last year. For the year ended December 31, 2002, adjusted net income was $236.1 million, or $1.42 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $211.6 million, or $1.24 per share, for 2001. Annual revenue for 2002 was $2,365.1 million compared to $2,257.5 million during 2001. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $ 453.9 million compared to adjusted operating income of $415.5 million last year. James E. O'Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, was pleased with the Company's performance saying, "In January 2002, we announced Republic's goals for annual earnings per share and free cash flow. I am proud to say that our employees did an excellent job of executing our business plan during 2002. It was our team focus that permitted Republic - in spite of a weak economy - to exceed these goals, generate record amounts of free cash and continue to achieve positive revenue and earnings growth."
In the first quarter of 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortizing intangibles with indefinite lives effective January 1, 2002. If SFAS 142 had been effective January 1, 2001, adjusted net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2001 would have been $54.1 million, or $0.32 per share, and $237.4 million, or $1.39 per share, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a $5.6 million gain primarily related to the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the three months ended December 31, 2001. Including the recognition of this gain, Republic reported net income of $239.6 million, or $1.44 per share, and $61.5 million, or $0.37 per share, for the year and three months ended December 31, 2002, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a non-cash, after-tax charge of $86.1 million primarily related to exiting certain markets and non-core businesses. Including the charge, Republic reported net income of $125.5 million, or $0.73 per share, and a net loss of $(38.9) million or $(0.23) per share, for the year and three months ended December 31, 2001, respectively. FISCAL YEAR 2003 OUTLOOK Republic also announced its outlook for fiscal 2003. The Company's objectives for 2003 remain consistent with previous years and once again focus on increasing free cash flow. The Company anticipates using free cash flow to repurchase common stock under its $150 million share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in October 2002. Republic's guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any deterioration or improvement in the overall economy in 2003. Specific guidance is as follows: o FREE CASH FLOW: The Company anticipates free cash flow for 2003 in a range of approximately 90 percent of 2003 net income. The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of equipment as presented in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. o EARNINGS PER SHARE: The Company anticipates 2003 earnings in the range of $1.49 to $1.51 per share. These anticipated earnings exclude an estimated 2
$0.03 of additional non-cash landfill costs associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"), and costs associated with additional landfill gas systems. Including these additional non-cash costs, the Company anticipates 2003 earnings in the range of $1.46 to $1.48 per share. o INTERNAL GROWTH: The Company believes internal growth will be approximately 2 to 3 percent, with 1 to 1.5 percent from price increases and 1 to 1.5 percent from volume growth. o CAPITAL SPENDING: The Company anticipates 2003 capital spending of approximately $260 million.

REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC. SUPPLEMENTAL UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001. It should also be read in conjunction with the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-Q as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002. CASH FLOW The following table reflects certain components of the Company's unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 (in millions): The Company defines free cash flow as net income plus depreciation, amortization and depletion less capital expenditures plus net changes in assets and liabilities resulting from operating activities. This simple definition excludes certain commonly used elements of free cash flow such as deferred taxes and proceeds from the sale of equipment. Beginning January 1, 2003, the Company's definition of free cash flow will be revised to include cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of equipment as presented in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. In December 1999, the Company entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment. In July 2002, the Company exercised its right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. The Company's guidance for capital expenditures in previous years included equipment obtained through the operating lease facility. Accordingly, the payment made by the Company to terminate this facility has been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortizing intangibles with indefinite lives effective January 1, 2002. If SFAS 142 had been effective January 1, 2001, amortization of intangible assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2001 would have been $1.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Capital expenditures include $.7 million and $1.1 million of capitalized interest for the three months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and $2.5 million and $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, accounts receivable were $238.6 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $19.0 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 36 (or 23 days net of deferred revenue). STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM During the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, the Company paid approximately $150.0 million to repurchase 7,954,000 shares of its stock of which $11.6 million was paid during the three months ended December 31, 2002 to repurchase 570,100 shares of stock. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had repurchased a total of 17,167,600 shares of its stock for approximately $300.0 million. In October 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $150.0 million of its common stock. 6
