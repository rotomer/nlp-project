Republic Services, Inc.

EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2003 increased to $165.3 million (consisting of operating income of $105.4 million, accretion of $3.1 million, and depreciation, amortization and depletion of $56.8 million) compared to $151.3 million (consisting of operating income of $106.9 million, and depreciation, amortization and depletion of $44.4 million) for the same period in 2002.
Fort Lauderdale, FL, April 29, 2003...
During the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 required the Company to change the methodology it used to record closure and post-closure costs at its landfills. During the three months ended March 31, 2003, in accordance with APB No. 20, the Company recorded an after-tax expense of $37.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to the adoption of SFAS 143 and a change in accounting principle relating to methane gas collection systems. These changes do not effect the Company's cash flows.
Including the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles, net income for the three months ended March 31, 2003 was $16.8 million, or $0.10 per share. If the changes in accounting principles were effective January 1, 2002, net income for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 would have been $54.6 million, or $0.33 per share, and $54.4 million, or $0.32 per share, respectively.
Commenting on these results, James E. O'Connor, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, said, "I am pleased with the Company's performance during the quarter and our ability to
 
generate positive free cash flow. While the economy shows no signs of recovery and fuel costs were substantially higher in the first quarter of 2003, our field organization has moved quickly to offset higher fuel costs with select customer fuel surcharges and additional cost-control measures. I am confident that Republic is positioned to meet its 2003 financial objectives including its goal for free cash flow."

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
     During the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 required the Company to change the methodology it used to record closure and post-closure costs related to its landfills. Upon adopting SFAS 143, the Company no longer records closure and post-closure expense as a component of cost of operations. Instead, amortization expense is recorded on the capitalized portion of the obligation and accretion expense is recorded using the effective rate method.
     During the three months ended March 31, 2003, the Company recorded an after-tax expense of $20.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, the Company also recorded an after-tax expense of $17.0 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to its accounting for methane gas collection systems.
     The following table summarizes the adjustments to net income and earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2002 as if SFAS 143 and the Company's change in accounting principle relating to its methane gas collection systems were adopted January 1, 2002:
