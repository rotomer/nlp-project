EXHIBIT 99.2 REPUBLIC CONTACTS Media Inquiries: Will Flower (954) 769-6392 Investor Inquiries: Tod Holmes (954) 769-2387 Ed Lang (954) 769-3591 REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $0.37 PER SHARE o Company initiates quarterly dividend o Company on target to meet 2003 financial objectives FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA., JULY 30, 2003...Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported net income of $60.4 million, or $0.37 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2003, versus $61.0 million, or $0.36 per share, for the comparable period last year. Revenue in the second quarter of 2003 increased 6.5 percent to $637.3 million from $598.2 million for the same period in 2002. Operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2003 was $113.5 million, compared to $116.3 million for the same quarter last year. EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2003 increased by 6.2% to $176.0 million compared to $165.7 million for the same period in 2002. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, net income, before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, was $115.0 million, or $0.70 per share, versus $115.9 million, or $0.69 per share, for the comparable period last year. Revenue increased 7.1 percent to $1,231.9 million from $1,150.1 million for the same period in 2002. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $218.9 million compared to $223.2 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2003 increased by 7.7% to $341.3 million compared to $317.0 million for the same period in 2002. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 required the Company to change the methodology it used to
record closure and post-closure costs at its landfills. As of January 1, 2003, in accordance with APB No. 20, the Company recorded an after-tax expense of $37.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to the adoption of SFAS 143 and a change in accounting principle relating to methane gas collection systems. These changes do not effect the Company's cash flows. Including the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles, net income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $77.2 million, or $0.47 per share. If the changes in accounting principles were effective January 1, 2002, net income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 would have been $115.0 million, or $0.70 per share, and $114.8 million, or $0.68 per share, respectively. "The Company's strong cash flow allows us to fund growth, continue to repurchase stock and introduce a quarterly dividend," said James E. O'Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, Inc. "We are on target to achieve our 2003 financial objectives. Our field organization's continued diligence has allowed us to overcome higher fuel and insurance costs. We remain focused on our revenue and cost initiatives. Providing excellent customer service, managing operational costs and increasing customer retention remain key focal points for the organization."

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES During the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 required the Company to change the methodology it used to record closure and post-closure costs related to its landfills.

Instead, amortization expense is recorded on the capitalized portion of the obligation and accretion expense is recorded using the effective interest method. As of January 1, 2003, the Company recorded an after-tax expense of $20.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, the Company also recorded an after-tax expense of $17.0 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to its accounting for methane gas collection systems. The following table summarizes the adjustments to net income and earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2002 as if SFAS 143 and the Company's change in accounting principle relating to its methane gas collection systems were adopted January 1, 2002: 6
