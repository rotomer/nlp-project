     The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
     During the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 required the Company to change the methodology it used to record closure and post-closure costs related to its landfills. Upon adopting SFAS 143, the Company no longer records closure and post-closure expense as a component of cost of operations. Instead, amortization expense is recorded on the capitalized portion of the obligation and accretion expense is recorded using the effective interest method.
     As of January 1, 2003, the Company recorded an after-tax expense of $20.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, the Company also recorded an after-tax expense of $17.0 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to its accounting for methane gas collection systems.
OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, DEPLETION AND ACCRETION
     Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion, and accretion, which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning the Company's operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. Although depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in the Company's customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment the Company's existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to the Company's shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining the Company's investment grade rating and minimizing debt.
 
CASH FLOW
     During the three months ended March 31, 2004, cash provided by operating activities was $190.3 million, cash used in investing activities was $44.4 million and cash used in financing activities was $90.8 million.
     The Company defines free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company's free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2004 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information regarding the Company's recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. It also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy as previously discussed and is a key metric used by the Company to determine compensation. Free cash flow does not represent the Company's cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
     Capital expenditures include $.4 million of capitalized interest for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     As of March 31, 2004, accounts receivable were $250.0 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $17.7 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 35 (or 23 days net of deferred revenue).
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     During the three months ended March 31, 2004, the Company paid approximately $93.1 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares of its stock. As of March 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased a total of 29.1 million shares of its stock for approximately $577.4 million. The Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to an additional $172.6 million under its repurchase program including the $75.0 million increase to the program approved by its Board of Directors in April 2004.
DIVIDEND
     In July 2003, the Company announced that its Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.06 per share. In January 2004, the Company paid a dividend of $9.4 million to shareholders of record as of January 2, 2004. As of March 31, 2004, the Company recorded a dividend payable of approximately $9.3 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 1, 2004, which has been paid. In April 2004, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.06 per share for shareholders of record on July 1, 2004.
