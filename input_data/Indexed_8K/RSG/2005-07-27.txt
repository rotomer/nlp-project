OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, DEPLETION AND ACCRETION
     Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning the Company's operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. Although depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in the Company's customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment the Company's existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to the Company's shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining the Company's investment grade rating and minimizing debt.
CASH FLOW
     During the three months ended June 30, 2005, cash provided by operating activities was $167.5 million, cash used in investing activities was $47.2 million and cash used in financing activities was $161.8 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, cash provided by operating activities was $335.1 million, cash used in investing activities was $58.5 million and cash used in financing activities was $387.8 million.
 
     The Company defines free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company's free cash flow for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information regarding the Company's recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. It also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy as previously discussed and is a key metric used by the Company to determine compensation. Free cash flow does not represent the Company's cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
     Capital expenditures include $.3 million and $.4 million of capitalized interest for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $.5 million and $.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
     As of June 30, 2005, accounts receivable were $268.4 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $17.9 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 33 (or 23 net of deferred revenue).
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     During the three months ended June 30, 2005, the Company paid approximately $148.0 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares of its common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Company repurchased a total of 10.2 million shares of its common stock for approximately $337.1 million. The Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to an additional $437.5 million under its existing stock repurchase program.
DIVIDENDS
     In April 2005, the Company paid a dividend of $17.4 million to shareholders of record as of April 1, 2005. As of June 30, 2005, the Company recorded a dividend payable of approximately $17.0 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2005, which has been paid. In July 2005, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.14 per share for shareholders of record on October 3, 2005, payable on October 17, 2005.
