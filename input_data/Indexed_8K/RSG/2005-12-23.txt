On December 23, 2005, Republic Services, Inc. issued a press release to announce that on December 20, 2005, its Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all of the outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees, including all executive officers, effective December 30, 2005, a copy of which is incorporated herein by reference and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. As a result of the acceleration, the Company anticipates recording a non-cash charge of approximately $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2005. This action was taken in anticipation of changes to the Company's compensation programs beginning in 2006.
ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
