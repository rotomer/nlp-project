ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
The Company's Proxy Statement dated March 31, 2006 stated that each incumbent director attended at least 80% of the total number of meetings of the board of directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the board on which they served, other than Mr. Hudson who, due to personal circumstances participated in 63% of the scheduled meetings of the board of directors.
The Company clarifies that Mr. Hudson in fact attended six of eight, or 75%, of the board of directors meetings in 2005. He attended five of those meetings in full. He attended over half of a sixth meeting, but missed the initial portion of that meeting, due to a family medical emergency and personal circumstances not within his control.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
