Republic Services also announced today that it is increasing its 2006 guidance for free cash flow and earnings per share to reflect the Company's first six month performance and current favorable business conditions.
Separately, Republic announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 14 percent increase in the Company's regular quarterly dividend from $0.14 per share to $0.16 per share. The quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share will be paid on October 16, 2006 to shareholders of record on October 2, 2006.
"We are focused on growing free cash flow and expanding our operating profit margins," said James E. O'Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, Inc.

     The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. It should also be read in conjunction with the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-Q as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2006.
EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE
     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)") effective January 1, 2006. Stock options granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) were fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and, consequently, no compensation expense will be recognized for these options.
OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, DEPLETION AND ACCRETION
     Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning the Company's operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in the Company's customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment the Company's existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to the Company's shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining the Company's investment grade rating and minimizing debt. This measure has material limitations. Although depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years.
 
CASH FLOW
     During the three months ended June 30, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $142.6 million, cash used in investing activities was $48.6 million and cash used in financing activities was $78.2 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $146.8 million, cash used in investing activities was $146.6 million and cash used in financing activities was $101.3 million.
     The Company defines free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company's free cash flow for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 is calculated as follows (in millions):
Free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was negative because of an $83.0 million federal tax payment for 2005 that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina, and because of payments made during the three months ended March 31, 2006 for capital and other expenditures incurred in 2005.
The Company expects normalized free cash flow for 2006 to exceed 100% of net income. Normalized free cash flow excludes $113.4 million of federal tax payments and approximately $60 million of payments for capital and other expenditures that relate to 2005 that will be made during 2006.
The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding the Company's recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy as previously discussed and is a key metric used by the Company to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent the Company's cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
     Capital expenditures include $.6 million and $.3 million of capitalized interest for the three months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $.9 million and $.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
     As of June 30, 2006, accounts receivable were $302.1 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $18.2 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 35 (or 22 net of deferred revenue).
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     During the three months ended June 30, 2006, the Company paid $185.2 million to repurchase 4.5 million shares of its common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company repurchased a total of 8.1 million shares of its common stock for $325.8 million. As of June 30, 2006, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $165.4 million under its existing stock repurchase program.
 
DIVIDENDS
     In April 2006, the Company paid a dividend of $19.2 million to shareholders of record as of April 3, 2006. As of June 30, 2006, the Company recorded a dividend payable of approximately $18.7 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 3, 2006, which has been paid. In July 2006, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.16 per share for shareholders of record on October 2, 2006.
