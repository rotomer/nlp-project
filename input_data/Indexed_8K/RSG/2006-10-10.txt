Pursuant to the amendment, Mr. O'Connor will continue to receive an annual base salary of $840,000 and will continue to be eligible to receive an annual bonus in a target amount equal to 100% of his annual base salary. The current retirement policy with respect to Mr. O'Connor for purposes of all (i) equity awards (including stock options and restricted stock), (ii) monetary awards (including payments pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan) and (iii) contributions to the Company's deferred compensation arrangements, that are made after July 26, 2006 was amended to require Mr. O'Connor to give the Company at least one year written notice of his intent to retire. To the extent that Mr. O'Connor does not give one year written notice, then the retirement policy for such awards and contributions made after July 26, 2006 shall require Mr. O'Connor to attain age sixty (60) and have at least fifteen years of service with the Company or to attain age sixty-five (65) and have at least five (5) years of service with the Company.

Mr. O'Connor is currently age 57 and has seven years of service with the Company. Mr. O'Connor's employment agreement was also amended to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. To the extent Mr. O'Connor is a "key employee" for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, the timing of any severance payments or other payments due to him following his termination of employment with the Company shall be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid an excise tax from being imposed pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
