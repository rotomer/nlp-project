Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported that for the three months ended December 31, 2006, net income was $66.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to net income of $60.0 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2005 included a non-cash charge of $1.3 million, net of tax, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2006 increased 3.8 percent to $766.2 million compared to $738.1 million for the same period in 2005. Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was $129.7 million compared to operating income of $115.4 million for the same period last year.
Fort Lauderdale, FL, Feb. 1, 2007...
For the year ended December 31, 2006, net income was $279.6 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, compared to $253.7 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, for 2005. Net income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 included a $5.1 million tax benefit, or approximately $.04 per diluted share, related to the resolution of various income tax matters. Net income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 included a
 
non-cash charge of $1.3 million, net of tax, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees. Annual revenue for 2006 increased 7.2 percent to $3,070.6 million compared to $2,863.9 million for 2005. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $519.5 million compared to operating income of $477.2 million for 2005.
James E. O'Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, stated, "In 2006, we experienced another record setting year. Annual revenue increased 7.2 percent for the full year as the Company exceeded $3 billion in revenue for the first time in its history. Operating margins improved 20 basis points, from 16.7 percent to 16.9 percent. During 2007, we will remain focused on delivering quality service to our customers and improving our return on investment."
Republic Services also announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.16 per share (on a pre-split basis) to shareholders of record on April 2, 2007. This cash dividend will be paid on April 16, 2007, after a 3-for-2 stock split is effected, and, as a result, will be $0.1067 per share after giving effect to the 3-for-2 stock split.
Republic Services' objectives for 2007 remain consistent, focusing on enhancing shareholder value through the generation and efficient use of free cash flow. The Company anticipates using free cash flow to repurchase common stock and to pay regular quarterly dividends. Republic's guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any deterioration or improvement in the overall economy in 2007.
 
The Company's 2007 guidance is as follows:
Republic Services, Inc. is a leading provider of solid waste collection, transfer and disposal services in the United States. The Company's operating units are focused on providing solid waste services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers.

     The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. It should also be read in conjunction with the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-Q as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006.
EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE
     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)") effective January 1, 2006. Stock options granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) were fully vested as of December 31, 2005, and, consequently, no compensation expense will be recognized for these options.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
     During the three months ended September 30, 2006, the Company recorded a $5.1 million net income tax benefit in its provision for income taxes. This benefit relates to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of the federal tax audit for years 1998 through 2000. The Company expects its effective tax rate for 2007 to be approximately 38.5%.
OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, DEPLETION AND ACCRETION
     Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning the Company's operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in the Company's customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment the Company's existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to the Company's shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining the Company's investment grade rating and minimizing debt. This measure has material limitations. Although depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years.
 
CASH FLOW
     During the three months ended December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $221.3 million, cash used in investing activities was $39.0 million and cash used in financing activities was $202.5 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $522.1 million, cash used in investing activities was $215.4 million and cash used in financing activities was $409.4 million.
     The Company defines free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company's free cash flow for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by an $83.0 million federal tax payment for 2005 that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding this payment, the Company's free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 would have been $286.0 million.
     The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding the Company's recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy as previously discussed and is a key metric used by the Company to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent the Company's cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
     Capital expenditures include $1.0 million and $.8 million of capitalized interest for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $2.7 million and $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
     As of December 31, 2006, accounts receivable were $293.8 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $18.8 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 34 (or 22 net of deferred revenue).
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     During the three months ended December 31, 2006, the Company paid $74.3 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of its common stock. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the Company repurchased a total of 12.2 million shares of its common stock for $492.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $249.2 million of its common stock under its existing stock repurchase program.
 
DIVIDENDS
     In October 2006, the Company paid a dividend of $21.1 million to shareholders of record as of October 2, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company recorded a dividend payable of $20.8 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2007, which has been paid. In January 2007, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.16 per share (on a pre-split basis) to shareholders of record on April 2, 2007. This cash dividend will be paid on April 16, 2007, after a 3-for-2 stock split is effected, and, as a result, will be $0.1067 per share after giving effect to the 3-for-2 stock split.
