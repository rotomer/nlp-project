Republic Services also announced today that it is increasing its 2007 guidance for earnings per share and free cash flow to reflect the Company's performance for the first six months of 2007 and certain current favorable business conditions.
Separately, Republic announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 60 percent increase in the Company's regular quarterly dividend from $0.1067 per share to $0.17 per share. The quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share will be paid on October 15, 2007 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2007. The Company also announced the continuation of a stock repurchase program following the Board of Directors authorization to repurchase an additional $250 million of Company stock in 2007 and 2008.
"We continue to realize the benefits of our pricing initiatives which are driving our improving returns on capital and our expanding operating margins," said James E. O'Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, Inc. "The exceptional performance of our entire field organization is one of the main reasons behind our strong financial results. These results have permitted the Board of Directors to continue Republic's practice of distributing free cash flow to, and capturing value for, our shareholders by approving an additional $250 million for share repurchases, which is the cornerstone of our financial strategy, and by also increasing our annual dividend by 60 percent."

     The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. It should also be read in conjunction with the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing in the Company's Form 10-Q as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2007.
STOCK SPLIT
     In January 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split effective on March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of March 5, 2007. The Company distributed approximately 64.5 million shares from treasury stock to effect the stock split. The Company's shares of treasury stock, earnings per share and weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding have been retroactively adjusted for all periods to reflect the stock split.
INCOME TAXES
     The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("the Interpretation") effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of adopting the Interpretation, the Company recorded a $5.6 million cumulative adjustment to decrease retained earnings.
     During the first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded $4.2 million of additional income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $5.0 million reduction in income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters, which effectively closes the Internal Revenue Service's audits of the Company's consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. The Company expects its effective tax rate for the remainder of 2007 to be approximately 38.5%.
CHARGE FOR LANDFILL MATTER
     During the first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $22.0 million ($13.5 million net of tax), related to estimated costs to comply with Final Findings and Orders (the "F&Os") issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency ("OEPA") in response to environmental conditions at the Company's Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility ("Countywide") in East Sparta, Ohio. The Company will also incur approximately $3.3 million of additional amortization and depletion expense during 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at this landfill as a result of the OEPA's F&Os, of which $1.6 million has been recorded through the six months ended June 30, 2007.
OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, DEPLETION AND ACCRETION
     Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 is calculated as follows (in millions):
 
     The Company believes that the presentation of operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning the Company's operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in the Company's customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment the Company's existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to the Company's shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining the Company's investment grade rating and minimizing debt. This measure has material limitations. Although depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years.
CASH FLOW
     During the six months ended June 30, 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $309.7 million, cash used in investing activities was $81.6 million and cash used in financing activities was $231.3 million.
     The Company defines free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company's free cash flow for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding the Company's recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy as previously discussed and is a key metric used by the Company to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent the Company's cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
     Capital expenditures include $1.3 million capitalized interest for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
 
     As of June 30, 2007, accounts receivable were $312.3 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $13.9 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 34.6 (or 22.4 net of deferred revenue). In the second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $4.3 million reduction to its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of the Company refining its estimate of its allowance for doubtful accounts based on its historical collection experience.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     During the three months ended June 30, 2007, the Company paid $94.4 million to repurchase 3.1 million shares of its common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company repurchased a total of 4.8 million shares of its common stock for $165.1 million. As of June 30, 2007, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $84.1 million of its common stock under its existing stock repurchase program. In July 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $250 million of Company stock. Combined, Republic has the authority to repurchase $334.1 million of its common stock.
CASH DIVIDENDS
     In April 2007, the Company paid a cash dividend of $20.7 million to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, the Company recorded a dividend payable of $20.5 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 2, 2007, which has been paid. In July 2007, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.17 per share payable to shareholders of record as of October 1, 2007.
