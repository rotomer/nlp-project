Commenting on the stock repurchase program, James E. O'Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, Inc., said, "Republic consistently generates substantial amounts of free cash flow. Our stock repurchase program is the cornerstone of our cash utilization strategy and has proven to be an excellent way to return value to our shareholders."
During 2007, Republic repurchased 11.1 million shares, or 5.7 percent, of Company stock for a total of $362.8 million. Since the inception of Republic's stock repurchase program in 2000, the Company has repurchased $2.2 billion, or approximately 41 percent, of the Company's outstanding shares.

The stock repurchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or a combination of both. The timing and amounts of any repurchases will be at the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including the market price of the common stock, overall market conditions, and possible acquisitions.
