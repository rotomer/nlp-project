INCOME TAXES
     The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("the Interpretation") effective January 1, 2007, as required. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded $4.2 million of additional income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $5.0 million reduction in income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters, including the effective closing of the Internal Revenue Service's audits of the Company's tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. The Company expects its effective tax rate for fiscal year 2008 to be approximately 38.5%.
OTHER MATTERS
     As previously reported, on June 22, 2008, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Allied Waste Industries, Inc. ("Allied"). The completion of the Merger is subject to certain terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, approval of the transaction by the shareholders of both Republic and Allied, regulatory approval from the Department of Justice, and receipt of credit ratings for the combined company classifying its senior unsecured debt as investment grade. The Merger Agreement also contains other terms and conditions that are customary for a merger of equals transaction. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Allied common stock outstanding will be converted into .45 shares of Republic common stock. Republic expects to issue approximately 198 million shares of common stock to Allied shareholders in the transaction. Mr. James E. O'Connor, currently Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Republic, and Mr. Tod Holmes, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, will continue in their present positions with the combined company. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of June 30, 2008, the Company had capitalized $4.9 million of costs to other assets that are directly related to the transaction.
Proposed Merger with Allied.
     During the first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $22.0 million ($13.5 million, or $.07 per diluted share, net of tax), related to estimated costs the Company believed would be required to comply with Final Findings and Orders ("F&Os") issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency ("OEPA") in response to environmental conditions at the Company's Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility ("Countywide") in East Sparta, Ohio. The Company has complied with and will continue to comply with the F&Os. However, even though indications existed that the reaction had begun to subside, the Company nevertheless agreed with the OEPA to take certain additional remedial actions at Countywide. Consequently, during the three months ended September 30, 2007, the Company recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $23.3 million ($14.4 million, or $.08 per diluted share, net of tax).
Countywide Landfill Remediation.
     During the second quarter of 2008, the Company received additional orders from the OEPA. The Company also entered into an Agreed Order on Consent ("AOC") with the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("U.S. EPA"). As a result of the additional orders received from the OEPA and the orders received from the U.S. EPA, the Company recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $34.0 million ($21.8 million, or $.12 per diluted share, net of tax) during the three months ended June 30, 2008.
     The remediation liability remaining as of June 30, 2008 for Countywide is $46.8 million, of which approximately $14.0 million is expected to be paid out during the remainder of 2008. The majority of the remaining costs are expected to be paid during 2009
 
through 2011. While the Company is vigorously pursuing financial contributions from third parties for its costs to comply with the F&Os and the additional remedial actions, the Company has not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries.
     It is reasonably possible that the Company will need to adjust the charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in the Company's estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
OPERATING INCOME BEFORE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, DEPLETION AND ACCRETION
     Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 is calculated as follows (in millions):
     The Company believes that the presentation of operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning the Company's operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in the Company's customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment the Company's existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to the Company's shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining the Company's investment grade rating and minimizing debt. This measure has material limitations. Although depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years.
CASH FLOW
     The Company defines free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company's free cash flow for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 is calculated as follows (in millions):
 
     Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and the free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows (in millions):
     The adjustments noted above do not affect either the Company's net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in its unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows or its free cash flow.
     The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding the Company's recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates the Company's ability to execute its financial strategy as previously discussed and is a key metric used by the Company to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent the Company's cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. The Company's definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
     Capital expenditures include $.7 million and $1.0 million of capitalized interest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, and $.7 million and $1.3 million of capitalized interest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007.
     As of June 30, 2008, accounts receivable were $320.1 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $14.4 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 34.7 (or 20.8 net of deferred revenue).
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     During the three months ended June 30, 2008, the Company paid $40.6 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares of its common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Company repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares of its common stock for $138.4 million. As of June 30, 2008, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $248.0 million of its common stock under its existing stock repurchase program. During the second quarter of 2008, the Company suspended its share repurchase program as a result of its planned merger with Allied.
 
CASH DIVIDENDS
     In April 2008, the Company paid a cash dividend of $31.1 million to shareholders of record as of April 1, 2008. As of June 30, 2008, the Company recorded a dividend payable of $30.9 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2008, which has been paid. In July 2008, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $.19 per share. The Board also declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.19 per share payable to shareholders of record as of October 1, 2008.
