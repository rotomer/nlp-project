ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
Republic Services, Inc. (the "Company") announced today that on August 1, 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary, Republic Services of Southern Nevada ("RSSN"), signed a Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement (the "Consent Decree") with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County related to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has agreed to perform certain remedial activities at the Sunrise Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County were otherwise jointly and severally liable. RSSN is currently working with the Clark County Staff and Board of Commissioners to develop a mechanism to recover or fund costs to comply with the Consent Decree.
The Company will record, based on management's best estimates, a $35.0 million charge to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes ($22.0 million, or approximately $.12 per diluted share, net of tax) during the three months ending June 30, 2008 to comply with the Consent Decree. This charge is not expected to have a material impact on cash flow from operating activities during 2008.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
