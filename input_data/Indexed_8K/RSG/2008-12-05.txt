REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.,

MICHAEL J. CORDESMAN
     Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Employment Agreement (as defined below).
     , the Company and the Employee are parties to that certain Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated February 27, 2007 (the "Employment Agreement"); and
WHEREAS
     , the parties mutually desire to amend certain terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement.
WHEREAS
     , in consideration of the mutual recitals and covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
 
          (a) General. It is the intention of both the Company and Employee that the benefits and rights to which Employee could be entitled pursuant to this Agreement comply with Code Section 409A, to the extent that the requirements of Code Section 409A are applicable thereto, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with that intention. If Employee or the Company believes, at any time, that any such benefit or right that is subject to Code Section 409A does not so comply, it shall promptly advise the other and shall negotiate reasonably and in good faith to amend the terms of such benefits and rights such that they comply with Section 409A (with the most limited possible economic effect on Employee and on the Company).
          (b) Distributions on Account of Separation from Service. If and to the extent required to comply with Code Section 409A, payment or benefit required to be paid under this Agreement on account of termination of Employee's employment shall be made upon Employee incurring a "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A.
 
          (c) Six Month Delay for Specified Employees. If Employee is a "specified employee," as that term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A, then no payment or benefit that is payable on account of Employee's "separation from service", as that term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A, shall be made before the date that is six months after Employee's "separation from service" (or, if earlier, the date of Employee's death) if and to the extent that such payment or benefit constitutes deferred compensation (or may be nonqualified deferred compensation) under Code Section 409A and such deferral is required to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A. Any payment or benefit delayed by reason of the prior sentence shall be paid out or provided in a single lump sum at the end of such required delay period in order to catch up to the original payment schedule.
          (d) No Acceleration of Payments. Neither the Company nor Employee, individually or in combination, may accelerate any payment or benefit that is subject to Code Section 409A, except in compliance with Code Section 409A and the provisions of this Agreement, and no amount that is subject to Code Section 409A shall be paid prior to the earliest date on which it may be paid without violating Code Section 409A.
          (e) Treatment of Each Installment as a Separate Payment. For purposes of applying the provisions of Code Section 409A to this Agreement, each separately identified amount to which Employee is entitled under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. In addition, to the extent permissible under Code Section 409A, any series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.
          (f) Tax Gross-Ups. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any payment, to the extent such payment constitute deferral of compensation under Code Section 409A, to reimburse the Employee in an amount equal to all or a designated portion of the Federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed upon Employee as a result of compensation paid or made available to the service provider by the Company, including the amount of additional taxes imposed upon Employee due to the Company's payment of the initial taxes on such compensation, shall be made no later than the end of Employee's taxable year next following Employee's taxable year in which Employee remits the related taxes."
 
     this Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by the Employee and by a duly authorized officer of the Company as of the date first above written.
