Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 15, 2008, Republic Services, Inc. ("Republic"), Allied Waste Industries, Inc. ("Allied"), Allied Waste North America, Inc. ("AWNA"), U.S. Bank National Association (f/k/a U.S. Bank Trust National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the Allied and Republic subsidiary guarantors named therein entered into a twenty-first supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") to the Indenture, dated as of December 23, 1998, by and among Allied, AWNA, the subsidiary guarantors named therein and the Trustee.
The Supplemental Indenture amends the supplemental indentures under which each of the following series of debt securities of AWNA (collectively, the "Notes") were issued:
6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2010 (CUSIP No. 01958XBA4) 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2011 (CUSIP No. 01958XBD8) 6 3/8% Senior Notes due 2011 (CUSIP No. 01958XBK2) 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2013 (CUSIP No. 01958XAZ0) 6 1/8% Senior Notes due 2014 (CUSIP No. 01958XBF3) 7 3/8% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014 (CUSIP No. 01958XBH9) 7 1/4% Senior Notes due 2015 (CUSIP No. 01958XBN6) 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016 (CUSIP No. 01958XBR7) 6 7/8% Senior Notes due 2017 (CUSIP No. 01958XBS5)
The Supplemental Indenture modifies the reporting obligations of Allied under the supplemental indentures governing the Notes to allow Republic, rather than Allied or AWNA, to make the Securities and Exchange Commission filings that to this point have been made by Allied. In connection with the previously announced merger between Allied and Republic, Allied became a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic.
The amendments contained in the Supplemental Indenture were approved by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes then outstanding through a consent solicitation previously announced by Republic and Allied.
