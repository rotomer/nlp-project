ITEM 5.02. DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
At the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 14, 2009, the stockholders of Republic Services, Inc. (the "Company") approved (1) an amendment and restatement of the Executive Incentive Plan (the "Executive Incentive Plan") and (2) the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2009 Stock Purchase Plan", together with the Executive Incentive Plan, the "Plans"). The Compensation Committee of the Company's board of directors previously approved the Executive Incentive Plan on March 12, 2009 and the Company's board of directors previously adopted the 2009 Stock Purchase Plan on March 27, 2009, in each case subject to stockholder approval.
The Executive Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of annual awards, long-term awards and synergy awards to individuals selected from time to time by the Compensation Committee to participate in the Executive Incentive Plan. The 2009 Stock Purchase Plan is intended to provide a method whereby employees of the Company will have an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company through the purchase of the shares of common stock through accumulated voluntary payroll deductions. The number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be issued under the 2009 Stock Purchase Plan is 1,500,000.
For more complete descriptions of the Plans, see the Company's definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, 2009, which is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Plans were attached as Appendices A, B and C to the Proxy Statement and are included as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 to this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
