PHOENIX, AZ, November 2, 2009...Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported net income of $120.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, including merger-related gains and costs and other charges, for the three months ended September 30, 2009, versus $88.7 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year. Republic's third quarter 2009 financial results include Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (Allied) which merged with Republic on December 5, 2008.
Republic's income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2009, includes $0.9 million ($0.00 per diluted share) of a net loss on disposition of assets, $12.3 million ($0.02 per diluted share) of restructuring charges, $31.8 million ($0.05 per diluted share) of loss on extinguishment of debt, $8.9 million ($0.01 per diluted share) of costs to achieve synergies and a gain of $8.8 million ($0.01 per diluted share) related to insurance recoveries resulting from remediation activities. Excluding these items, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2009 would have been $149.3 million or $0.39 per diluted share. Income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2008 includes $3.2 million ($.01 per diluted share) of integration costs related to the Allied merger. Excluding these costs, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was $90.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share.
 
Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion for the three months ended September 30, 2009 was $627.4 million compared to $248.9 million for the comparable period in 2008. Excluding the net loss on disposition of assets, restructuring charges, costs to achieve synergies, and insurance recoveries recorded during 2009 and the integration costs recorded during 2008, operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion for the three months ended September 30, 2009 was $640.7 million, or 30.9% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $252.1 million, or 30.2% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2008 period.
Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2009 increased to $2,073.5 million compared to $834.0 million for the same period in 2008. Core price for the three months ended September 30, 2009 (assuming the merger with Allied had occurred on January 1, 2008) increased 2.8%. Offsetting the core price growth of 2.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2009 were decreases of 10.1% in core volume, 1.9% of commodity pricing and 3.6% in fuel recovery fees.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, net income was $459.4 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared to $205.5 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year. Republic's income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, includes $144.3 million ($0.23 per diluted share) of net gains on disposition of assets, $55.9 million ($0.09 per diluted share) of restructuring charges, $31.8 million ($0.05 per diluted share) of loss on extinguishment of debt, $31.8 million ($0.05 per diluted share) of costs to achieve synergies and a gain of $8.8 million ($0.01 per diluted share) related to insurance recoveries resulting from remediation activities. Excluding these items, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 would have been $438.6 million or $1.16 per diluted share.
Income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 includes a $34.0 million charge ($0.12 per diluted share) related to environmental conditions at our Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility in Ohio, a $35.0 million charge ($0.12 per diluted share) related to estimated costs to comply with a consent decree and settlement agreement related to the Sunrise Landfill in Nevada and $3.2 million ($0.01 per diluted share) of integration costs related to the merger with Allied. Excluding these charges and costs, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $251.3 million or $1.36 per diluted share.
Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $1,986.7 million compared to $635.2 million for the comparable period in 2008.
 
Excluding the net gain on disposition of assets, restructuring charges, costs to achieve synergies and insurance recoveries recorded during 2009 and the remediation charges and integration costs recorded during 2008, operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $1,921.3 million, or 31.0% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $706.4 million, or 28.9% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2008 period.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased to $6,200.1 million compared to $2,440.7 million for the same period in 2008. Core price for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 (assuming the merger with Allied had occurred on January 1, 2008) increased 3.2%. Offsetting the core price growth of 3.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 were decreases of 9.6% in core volume, 2.4% of commodity pricing and 2.6% in fuel recovery fees.
During the three months ended September 30, 2009, the Company completed the divestiture of assets and related liabilities required under the settlement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the Allied merger. After tax proceeds of $374.6 million related to these divestitures were used to repay amounts borrowed under the Company's credit facilities.
"Based on our continued solid performance, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance for the second time this year," said James E. O'Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, Inc. "Our new, full-year adjusted earnings guidance is a range of $1.46 to $1.48 per share, which represents a three cent per share increase over our previous guidance. We are also reaffirming our full-year free cash flow guidance of $700 to $725 million. I am especially pleased to see a 110 basis point increase in our adjusted year-over-year margins."
Commenting on merger-related synergies, Don Slager, President and Chief Operating Officer, stated, "We are realizing our synergy savings ahead of schedule. Our field organization continues to execute our merger strategy while remaining focused on revenue and cost control initiatives," said Mr. Slager. "Providing excellent customer service, managing operational costs and increasing customer retention remain key focal points for the organization."
 
Separately, Republic announced that its Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share to be paid on January 18, 2010 to shareholders of record on January 4, 2010.

The following information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 and our current report on Form 8-K filed June 5, 2009. It should also be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Form 10-Q as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2009.
REVENUE
The following table reflects our total revenue by line of business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008:
The following table summarizes our adjusted revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 which assumes our merger with Allied occurred on January 1, 2008:
Adjusted revenue is used to calculate internal growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009. Intercompany revenue relates to prior year transactions between Republic and Allied that would have been eliminated if the companies had merged on January 1, 2008.
The following table reflects changes in our core adjusted revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008. For comparative purposes, we have presented the components of our revenue changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 assuming our merger with Allied occurred on January 1, 2008. Our presentation also eliminates revenue associated with divested assets in the quarter the assets were sold and the comparable quarter in the prior year.
 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
We believe that the presentation of adjusted revenue and changes in adjusted revenue above provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to understand increases or decreases in our revenue that are driven by changes in the operations of the newly combined company, and not merely by the addition of Allied's revenues for periods after the merger. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes and is not intended to be indicative of the revenue that would have been realized had the merger been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented or the future results of the combined operations.
MERGER WITH ALLIED
We completed our acquisition of Allied effective December 5, 2008. In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has been allocated to assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the merger, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill. We are in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in the merger, and, until we have completed our valuation process, there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase price allocation.
As a condition of the merger with Allied in December 2008, the Department of Justice (DOJ) required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities. As of September 30, 2009 we are complete with our required divestitures.
The following table summarizes our revenue, costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 assuming the merger with Allied occurred on January 1, 2008:
We believe that the presentation of revenue and expenses above provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to understand increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses that are driven by changes in the operations of the newly combined company, and not merely by the addition of Allied's revenues and expenses for periods after the merger. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes and is not intended to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually occurred had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented or the future results of the combined operations.
 
RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES
Operating Income before Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and Accretion
Operating income before depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion (OIDADA), which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 is calculated as follows:
We believe that the presentation of OIDADA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. OIDADA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of OIDADA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.32 and $0.48 for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.21 and $1.11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of gains, charges (recoveries) and other expenses that impacted our OIDADA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. ("Net Income  Republic") and diluted earnings per share. These items primarily consist of the following:
 
We believe that the presentation of adjusted OIDADA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes gain and loss on disposition of assets, restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of debt, costs to achieve synergies, remediation charges (recoveries) and pre-merger integration costs which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain non-operational items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted OIDADA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Cash Flow
We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. Our free cash flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 is calculated as follows:
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows and the free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows:
The adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows or our free cash flow.
We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy as previously discussed and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed such as, debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
 
As of September 30, 2009, accounts receivable was $928.2 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $54.2 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 41 (or 26 net of deferred revenue).
CASH DIVIDENDS
In July 2009, we paid a cash dividend of $72.1 million to stockholders of record as of July 1, 2009. As of September 30, 2009, we recorded a dividend payable of $72.2 million to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 1, 2009, which has been paid. In October 2009, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share payable to stockholders of record as of January 4, 2010, which will be paid on January 18, 2010.
UPDATED FINANCIAL GUIDANCE
Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share
The following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 excluding gain on disposition of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt and insurance recoveries:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes gain on disposition of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, charges related to the integration of our businesses and insurance recoveries provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain gains on disposition of assets, merger related costs and insurance recoveries. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations when the integration process is complete. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
We define adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related costs. Our actual adjusted free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and our anticipated adjusted free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 are calculated as follows:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related costs and divestiture related tax payments. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed such as, debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
