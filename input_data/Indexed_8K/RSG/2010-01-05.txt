ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
Republic Services, Inc. (the "Company") has received an acceptance letter from the United States Department of Justice which settles the previously disclosed dispute between the federal taxing authorities and the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Allied Waste Industries, Inc. ("Allied"), regarding capital losses associated with the sale of stock of six BFI risk management companies. Under the settlement, the Company will resolve all remaining potential liability for this matter (that is, for federal and state tax, penalty, and interest) by making cash payments totaling approximately $125 million. Of this amount, the Company intends to pay approximately $72 million in the first quarter of 2010 and the remainder, approximately $53 million, later in 2010. While the final settlement amount is less than the amount that the Company had previously accrued for this matter, the accrual and the adjustment thereto are reflected in the Company's allocation of purchase price associated with its acquisition of Allied and have no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of income.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
