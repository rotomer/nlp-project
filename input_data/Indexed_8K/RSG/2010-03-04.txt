ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On March 4, 2010, Republic Services, Inc. (the "Company") completed the issuance and sale of $850 million of Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes") and $650 million of Senior Notes due 2040 (the "2040 Notes" and, together with the 2020 Notes, the "Notes") in a previously announced private offering.
The net proceeds of this offering, less discounts and the Company's expenses in connection with the offering, are approximately $1,486 million. From the net proceeds, the Company intends (i) to use $433.7 million to redeem the Company's 6.125% Senior Notes due 2014 (of which $425 million is currently outstanding) on March 8, 2010, (ii) to retain an estimated $621.8 million as cash on hand to redeem the Company's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2015 (of which $600 million is currently outstanding) on March 31, 2010, (iii) to use approximately $420.9 million to reduce amounts outstanding under the Company's credit facilities, and (iv) to use the remainder for general corporate purposes.
The Notes were sold only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons, in reliance on Regulation S. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may only be offered or sold in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
Indenture
The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture (the "Base Indenture"), dated as of November 25, 2009, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture (the "Supplemental Indentures" and, collectively with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), each dated as of March 4, 2010, by and among the Company, the guarantors named therein and the Trustee. Copies of the Supplemental Indentures are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
The Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on March 1, 2020 (in the case of the 2020 Notes) and March 1, 2040 (in the case of the 2040 Notes). Interest for the Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, beginning September 1, 2010. The Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company's subsidiaries that also guarantee the Company's revolving credit facility. These guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors.
At the Company's option, it may redeem some or all of the Notes, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of any interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Indenture), plus 25 basis points (in the case of the 2020 Notes) or 30 basis points (in the case of the 2040 Notes). Additionally, if the Company experiences specific kinds of changes of control, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Indenture provides for certain limitations on the Company's ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to (i) create liens on the capital stock or indebtedness of any principal subsidiary or certain property and (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions. Further, the Company may not consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of its assets as an entirety, unless, among other requirements: (i) the successor corporation assumes the Company's obligations on the Notes and (ii) no Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) has occurred and is continuing. Failure by the Company to pay when due any of its obligations or any of its principal subsidiaries' obligations in the aggregate principal amount of at least $25 million that continues for 25 days after notice to the Company by the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding constitutes a default under the Indenture.
Registration Rights Agreement
In addition, on March 4, 2010, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the guarantors named therein and Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers named therein. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of the Notes for freely tradable notes issued by the Company, that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the applicable series Notes exchanged. If the Company is unable to effect the exchange offer and in other limited circumstances, the Company agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Notes. The Company will be obligated to pay additional interest on the Notes if it does not complete the exchange offer not later than November 25, 2010, or in certain other circumstances if the Company is required to file a shelf registration statement.
The descriptions and provisions of the Base Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures and the Registration Rights Agreement set forth above are summaries only, are not necessarily complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full and complete terms contained in the Base Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures and the Registration Rights Agreement, copies of which are attached as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to purchase the Notes.

          The Securities may be redeemed at any time, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice to the Holders thereof as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of any interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of record of such Securities on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if any.

          Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to Article XI of the Indenture, each Holder of the Securities shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Security pursuant to Article XIV of the Indenture.
          If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (100% of the Holders in certain circumstances) at the time Outstanding that are affected, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities of such series and certain past Defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company or any other obligor on the Securities (in the event such other obligor is obligated to make payments in respect of the Securities), which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, this Security at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
          The Securities in certificated form are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a differing authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
          Except as indicated in the Indenture, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
          A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

          The Securities may be redeemed at any time, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice to the Holders thereof as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of any interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate, plus 30 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of record of such Securities on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if any.
          If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before the Redemption Date, the Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on a pro rata basis, by lot or by any other method the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
          In the case of any redemption of Securities in accordance with the Indenture, interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date or Special Record Date referred to on the face hereof. Securities (or portions thereof) for whose redemption and payment provision is made in accordance with the Indenture shall cease to bear interest from and after the Redemption Date.
          In the event of redemption or repurchase of this Security in accordance with the Indenture in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
          Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to Article XI of the Indenture, each Holder of the Securities shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Security pursuant to Article XIV of the Indenture.
          If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire Indebtedness on the Securities and (b) certain covenants and Defaults and Events of Default, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions (including certain amendments permitted without the consent of any Holders and certain amendments which required the consent of all of the Holders) as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders under the Indenture and the Securities at any time by the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding that are affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (100% of the Holders in certain circumstances) at the time Outstanding that are affected, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities of such series and certain past Defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company or any other obligor on the Securities (in the event such other obligor is obligated to make payments in respect of the Securities), which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, this Security at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
          The Securities in certificated form are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a differing authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
          Except as indicated in the Indenture, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
          A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities
     (a) Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permissible under applicable law or Commission policy (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a) hereof have been complied with), or there are no Transfer Restricted Securities outstanding, each of the Company and the Guarantors shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause to be filed with the Commission, a Registration Statement under the Securities Act relating to the Exchange Securities and the Exchange Offer, (ii) cause such Registration Statement to become effective, (iii) in connection with the foregoing, file (A) all pre-effective amendments to such Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to cause such Registration Statement to become effective, (B) if applicable, a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act and (C) cause all necessary filings in connection with the registration and qualification of the Exchange Securities to be made under the state securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of the Exchange Offer, and (iv) upon the effectiveness of such Registration Statement, commence the Exchange Offer.

Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with respect to such resales by any Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order to permit such resales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by any such Broker-Dealer except to the extent required by the Commission as a result of a change in policy after the date of this Agreement.

     The Company shall provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such Prospectus to all Broker-Dealers promptly upon request at any time during such 180-day (or shorter as provided in the foregoing sentence) period in order to facilitate such resales.

     (y) use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 120 day after the date such obligation arises but no earlier than November 25, 2010 (such date being the "Shelf Effectiveness Deadline").

     (b) . No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing, within 20 Business Days after receipt of a request therefor, such information as the Company may reasonably request for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein. Each Holder as to which any Shelf Registration Statement is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading.
Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the Shelf Registration Statement
 
          SECTION 5. . If either (i) the Exchange Offer has not been Consummated by the Exchange Date, (ii) any Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has not been filed by the Shelf Filing Deadline or declared effective by the Commission by the Shelf Effectiveness Deadline or (iii) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective but ceases to be effective at any time at which it is required to be effective under this Agreement (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), a "Registration Default"), the Company hereby agrees that the interest rate borne by the Transfer Restricted Securities shall be increased by 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of any Registration Default and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period (such increase, "Additional Interest"), but in no event shall the aggregate amount of such increases exceed 1.00% per annum. Following the earlier of (i) the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to the particular Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the date on which such Transfer Restricted Securities cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities, the interest rate borne by the relevant Transfer Restricted Securities will be reduced to the original interest rate borne by such Transfer Restricted Securities; that, if after any such reduction in interest rate, a different Registration Default occurs, the interest rate borne by the relevant Transfer Restricted Securities shall again be increased pursuant to the foregoing provisions. Additional Interest shall not accrue or be payable for more than one Registration Default at any given time, and shall accrue only for those days that a Registration Default occurs and is continuing.
Additional Interest
provided, however,
     All obligations of the Company and the Guarantors set forth in the preceding paragraph that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such security shall have been satisfied in full.
          SECTION 6. .
Registration Procedures
     (a) . In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall comply with all of the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof, shall use their reasonable best efforts to effect such exchange to permit the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and shall comply with all of the following provisions:
Exchange Offer Registration Statement
     (i) If in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Company, there is a question as to whether the Exchange Offer is permitted by applicable law, each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby agrees to seek a no-action letter or other favorable decision from the Commission allowing the Company and the Guarantors to Consummate an Exchange Offer for such Transfer Restricted Securities.

General Provisions
     (i) use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite financial statements (including any consolidating footnotes with respect to any Guarantors if required by the Securities Act) for the period specified in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable; upon the occurrence of any event that would cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or omission or (B) not to be effective and
 
usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the period required by this Agreement, the Company shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such Registration Statement, in the case of clause (A), correcting any such misstatement or omission, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), use its reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and such Registration Statement and the related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purpose(s) as soon as practicable thereafter;
     (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective amendments to the applicable Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for the applicable period set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and to comply fully with the applicable provisions of Rules 424, 430A and 430B under the Securities Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or blue sky laws, each of the Company and the Guarantors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time;

The objection of an Initial Purchaser or underwriter, if any, shall be deemed to be reasonable if such Registration Statement, amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains a material misstatement or omission;
     (v) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, promptly prior to the filing of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or Prospectus, provide copies of such document to the Initial Purchasers, and at their request, each selling Holder named in any Registration Statement, and to the underwriter(s), if any, make the Company's and the Guarantors' representatives available for discussion of such document and other customary due diligence matters, and include such information in such document prior to the filing thereof as such selling Holders or underwriter(s), if any, reasonably may request;

     (x) deliver to each selling Holder and each of the underwriter(s), if any, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons reasonably may request; each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby consents to the use of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders and each of the underwriter(s), if any, in connection with the offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto;
     (xi) enter into such agreements (including an underwriting agreement), and make such representations and warranties, and take all such other actions in connection therewith in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement, all to such extent as may be reasonably requested by any Initial Purchaser or by any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities or underwriter in connection with any sale or resale pursuant to any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement; and whether or not an underwriting agreement is entered into and whether or not the registration is an Underwritten Registration, each of the Company and the Guarantors shall:
     (A) furnish to each Initial Purchaser and, at their request, each selling Holder, and each underwriter, if any, in such substance and scope as they may reasonably request and as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in primary underwritten offerings, upon the date of the Consummation of the Exchange Offer or, if applicable, the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement:
     (1) a certificate, dated the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer or the date of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, signed by (y) the President or any Vice
 
President and (z) a principal financial or accounting officer of each of the Company and the Guarantors, confirming, as of the date thereof, the matters set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of Section 5(f) of the Purchase Agreement and such other matters as such parties may reasonably request;
     (2) an opinion, dated the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer or the date of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, of counsel for the Company and the Guarantors, covering the matters set forth in Section 5(d) of the Purchase Agreement and such other matters as such parties may reasonably request, and in any event including a statement to the effect that such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantors, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company and the Guarantors, representatives of the underwriter(s), if any, and counsel to the underwriter(s), if any, in connection with the preparation of such Registration Statement and the related Prospectus and have considered the matters required to be stated therein and the statements contained therein, although such counsel has not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements; and that such counsel advises that, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts came to such counsel's attention that caused such counsel to believe that the applicable Registration Statement, at the time such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto became effective, and, in the case of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as of the date of Consummation, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement as of its date and, in the case of the opinion dated the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer, as of the date of Consummation, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. Without limiting the foregoing, such counsel may state further that such counsel assumes no responsibility for, and has not independently verified, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the financial statements, notes and schedules and other financial data included in any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement or the related Prospectus; and
     (3) a customary comfort letter, dated the date of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, from the Company's independent accountants, in the customary form and covering matters of the type customarily requested to be covered in comfort letters by underwriters in connection with primary underwritten offerings, and covering or affirming the matters set forth in the comfort letters delivered pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Purchase Agreement, without exception;

     If at any time the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors contemplated in Section 6(c)(xi)(A)(1) hereof cease to be true and correct, the Company or the Guarantors shall so advise the Initial Purchasers and the underwriter(s), if any, and each selling Holder promptly and, if requested by such Persons, shall confirm such advice in writing;
     (xii) prior to any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities, reasonably cooperate with the selling Holders, the underwriter(s), if any, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the state securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the selling Holders or underwriter(s), if any, may request and do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that none of the Company nor the Guarantors shall be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation, other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Registration Statement, in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;
     (xiii) issue, upon the request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement, Exchange Securities having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities surrendered to the Company by such Holder in exchange therefor or being sold by such Holder; such Exchange Securities to be registered in the name of such Holder or in the name of the purchaser(s) of such Securities, as the case may be; in return, the Transfer Restricted Securities held by such Holder shall be surrendered to the Company for cancellation;
     (xiv) reasonably cooperate with the selling Holders and the underwriter(s), if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such Transfer Restricted Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders or the underwriter(s), if any, may request at least two Business Days prior to any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities made by such Holders or underwriter(s);
 
     (xv) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriter(s), if any, to consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities, subject to the proviso contained in Section 6(c)(xii) hereof;
     (xvi) if any fact or event contemplated by Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof shall exist or have occurred, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading;
     (xvii) provide a CUSIP number for all Securities not later than the effective date of the Registration Statement covering such Securities and provide the Trustee under the Indenture with printed certificates for such Securities which are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company and take all other action necessary to ensure that all such Securities are eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company;
     (xviii) reasonably cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with FINRA and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any underwriter (including any "qualified independent underwriter") that is required to be retained in accordance with the rules and regulations of FINRA;
     (xix) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make generally available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, a consolidated earnings statement meeting the requirements of Rule 158 under the Securities Act (which need not be audited) for the twelve-month period (A) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which Transfer Restricted Securities are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or best efforts Underwritten Offering or (B) if not sold to underwriters in such an offering, beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the Registration Statement;
     (xx) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act not later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement required by this Agreement, and, in connection therewith, cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders of Securities to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and to execute and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents that may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;
 
(xxi) cause all Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed if reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities or the managing underwriter(s), if any; and
     (xxii) provide promptly to each Holder upon request each document filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 and Section 15 of the Exchange Act.
     Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the existence of any fact of the kind described in Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(xvi) hereof, or until it is advised in writing (the "Advice") by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. If so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the time period regarding the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof to and including the date when each selling Holder covered by such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(xvi) hereof or shall have received the Advice; that no such extension shall be taken into account in determining whether Additional Interest is due pursuant to Section 5 hereof or the amount of such Additional Interest, it being agreed that the Company's option to suspend use of a Registration Statement pursuant to this paragraph shall be treated as a Registration Default for purposes of Section 5 hereof.
provided, however,
     In addition, the Company may suspend the offering and sales under the Exchange Offer Registration Statement subsequent to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration Statement for up to 45 days in each year during which such Exchange Offer Registration Statement is required to be effective and usable hereunder subsequent to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer or such Shelf Registration Statement is required to be effective and usable hereunder (measured from the date of effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement to successive anniversaries thereof):
     if (1) either:
(A) the Company shall be engaged in a material acquisition or disposition and (i) such acquisition or disposition is required to be disclosed in the Exchange Offer
 
Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or the failure by the Company to disclose such transaction in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement or related Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, as then amended or supplemented, would cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, or amendment thereto, to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement therein not misleading, or would cause such Prospectus, or supplement thereto, to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, (ii) information regarding the existence of such acquisition or disposition has not then been publicly disclosed by or on behalf of the Company and (iii) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in the exercise of its good faith judgment that disclosure of such acquisition or disposition would not be in the best interest of the Company or would have a material adverse effect on the consummation of such acquisition or disposition; or
(B) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in the exercise of its good faith judgment that compliance with the disclosure obligations set forth in Section 6(a) would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the matters described in clauses (A) and (B) are each referred to herein as a "Permitted Suspension Event"); and
     (2) the Company notifies the Holders within two Business Days after such Board of Directors makes the relevant determination set forth in clause (1); provided, however, that in each such case the applicable period specified in Section 3 (subsequent to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer) and Section 4 hereof during which the applicable Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement is required to be kept effective and usable shall be extended by the number of days during which such effectiveness was suspended pursuant to the foregoing and Additional Interest shall not apply during any period the Company is permitted to suspend offerings and sales under this sentence for a Permitted Suspension Event.
          SECTION 7. .
Registration Expenses
     (a) All expenses incident to the Company's and the Guarantors' performance of or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, regardless of whether a Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses (including filings made by any Initial Purchaser or Holder with FINRA); (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state securities or blue sky laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing certificates for the Exchange Securities to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of Prospectuses), messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all fees and disbursements of
 
counsel for the Company, the Guarantors and, subject to Section 7(b) hereof, the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities; (v) all application and filing fees in connection with listing the Exchange Securities on a securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements thereof; and (vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Company and the Guarantors (including the expenses of any special audit and comfort letters required by or incident to such performance). Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 7(b) below, the Holders for whose benefit a Registration Statement is being prepared shall pay all agency fees, underwriting discounts, commissions, fees and disbursements of counsel to the underwriters or the Holder(s), and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities or Exchange Securities by a Holder.
     Each of the Company and the Guarantors will, in any event, bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the Company or the Guarantors.
     (b) In connection with any Registration Statement required by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and the Shelf Registration Statement), the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Initial Purchasers and the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities being tendered in the Exchange Offer and/or resold pursuant to the "Plan of Distribution" contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, for the reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than one counsel, who acts for all of the Initial Purchasers and such Holders, who shall be Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP or such other counsel as may be chosen by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities for whose benefit such Registration Statement is being prepared.
          SECTION 8. .
Indemnification
     (a) Each of the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder and (ii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the Persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a "controlling person") and (iii) the officers, directors, employees and agents of any Holder (any Person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred to as an "Indemnified Holder"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including, without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred in connection with investigating, defending, settling (if such settlement is effectuated with the written consent of the Company and Guarantors as provided herein), compromising or paying any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body) to which an Indemnified Holder may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii)
 
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in both cases except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by any of the Holders expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company or any of the Guarantors may otherwise have.
     In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Guarantors, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company and the Guarantors in writing of such action or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve any of the Company or the Guarantors from any liability which they may have hereunder to the extent they are not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure, and will not in any event relieve the Company or the Guarantors from any other obligation or liability that they may have to any Indemnified Holder other than pursuant to this Agreement. In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Holder and such Indemnified Holder seeks or intends to seek indemnity from the Company and the Guarantors, the Company and the Guarantors will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that they shall elect, by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Holder, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Holder; provided, however, such Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Holder, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by any of the Company or Guarantors; (ii) the Company or the Guarantors have failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Holder; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Holder and the Company or the Guarantors or any affiliates of the Company or the Guarantors, and such Indemnified Holder shall have reasonably concluded, based on advice from counsel, that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Company or the Guarantors or any affiliate of the Company or the Guarantors or (y) a conflict may exist between such Indemnified Holder and the Company or the Guarantors or such affiliate of the Company or the Guarantors in conducting the defense of any such action (it being understood, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Holders and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Upon receipt of notice from the Company and the Guarantors to such Indemnified Holder of the Company's or the Guarantors' election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the Indemnified Holder of counsel, the Company and the Guarantors will not be liable to such Indemnified Holder under this Section 8(a) for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with the defense thereof unless the Indemnified
 
Holder shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company and the Guarantors. The Company and the Guarantors shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without their written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Company and the Guarantors agree to indemnify the Indemnified Holder against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Holder shall have requested the Company and the Guarantors to reimburse the Indemnified Holder for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 8 hereof, the Company and the Guarantors agree that they shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without their written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Company and the Guarantors of the aforesaid request and (ii) the Company and the Guarantors shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Holder in accordance with such request or disputed in good faith the Indemnified Holder's entitlement to such reimbursement prior to the date of such settlement. The Company and the Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in which any Indemnified Holder is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise, or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Holder.
     (b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors and their respective directors, officers of the Company and the Guarantors who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company or any of the Guarantors, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantors to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company and the Guarantors, and the Company, the Guarantors, their respective directors and officers and such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph.
     (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) or is otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the
 
other hand, from the Initial Placement (which in the case of the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Company and the Guarantors from the Initial Placement), the amount of Additional Interest which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments actions or expenses, and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8(a) hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 8(c); provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of indemnification.
     The Company, the Guarantors and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Initial Purchasers (and their related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several, and not joint, in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder.
          SECTION 9.
Rule 144A.
 
     Each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding, to make available to any Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
          SECTION 10. .
Participation in Underwritten Registrations
     No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
          SECTION 11. .
Selection of Underwriters
     The Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Transfer Restricted Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) that will administer such offering will be selected by the Company, provided, however, that such investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) must be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities included in such offering.
          SECTION 12. .
Miscellaneous
     (a) . Each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby agrees that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies
     (b) . Each of the Company and the Guarantors will not on or after the date of this Agreement enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. Neither the Company nor any of the Guarantors has previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any Person which requires the filing of a registration statement in the future or allows any party to piggyback on a Registration Statement, other than as described on Schedule B hereto. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's or any of the Guarantors' securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
     (c) . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has (i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 12(c)(i), obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer
Amendments and Waivers
 
Restricted Securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding any Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Company or its affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities being tendered or registered; provided, however, that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser with respect to which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver, consent or departure is to be effective.
     (d) . All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, fascimile, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery:
