Phoenix, AZ, July 29, 2010
Republic's net income for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 includes a number of charges and other expenses that impacted its results. A detail of these charges and other expenses is contained in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document.

Excluding certain charges and other expenses recorded during 2010 and 2009 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
 
depletion, amortization and accretion (adjusted EBITDA) for the three months ended June 30, 2010 would have been $645.8 million, or 31.3% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $633.5 million, or 30.7% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2009 period.
Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2010 increased to $2,066.4 million compared to $2,066.1 million for the same period in 2009.

You should read the following information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009. All amounts below are in millions, except per share data.
REVENUE
The following table reflects our total revenue by line of business for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009:
The following table reflects changes in our core adjusted revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. For comparative purposes, we have presented the components of our revenue changes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 assuming our merger with Allied occurred on January 1, 2008.
 
RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES
Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (EBITDA), which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 is calculated as follows:
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.42 and $0.59 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, compared to $0.59 and $0.89 for the comparable 2009 periods. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, we recorded a number of charges and other expenses and net gain on disposition of assets that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc., (Net Income  Republic) and diluted earnings per share. These items primarily consist of the following:
 
We believe that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Cash Flow
We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our free cash flow for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 is calculated as follows:
We define adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities, less property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax, plus tax settlement related to BFI risk management companies. Our adjusted free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2010 is calculated as follows:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax, plus tax settlement related to BFI risk management companies. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows:
The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of June 30, 2010, accounts receivable was $898.4 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $52.5 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 40 (or 25 net of deferred revenue).
 
CASH DIVIDENDS
In April 2010, we paid a cash dividend of $72.5 million to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2010. As of June 30, 2010, we recorded a dividend payable of $72.8 million to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2010, which was paid on July 15, 2010. In July 2010, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share payable to stockholders of record as of October 1, 2010, which will be paid on October 15, 2010.
