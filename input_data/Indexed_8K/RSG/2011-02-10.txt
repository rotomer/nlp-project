REPUBLIC CONTACTS
...Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported net income of $147.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2010, versus $35.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year.
Phoenix, AZ, February 10, 2011
Republic's net income for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 includes a number of charges and other expenses that impacted its results. A detail of these charges and other expenses is contained in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document. Excluding these items, net income for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 would have been $160.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, and $126.0 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, respectively.
Excluding certain charges and other expenses recorded during 2010 and 2009 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (adjusted EBITDA) for the three months ended December 31, 2010 would have been $616.8 million, or 30.5% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $588.2 million, or 29.4% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2009 period.
 
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2010 increased to $2,020.8 million compared to $1,999.0 million for the same period in 2009. Core price for the three months ended December 31, 2010 increased 1.0%, fuel surcharges increased 0.3% and commodities pricing increased 1.4%. Offsetting this revenue growth of 2.7% were decreases of 1.1% from core volume and 0.5% related to divestitures.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, net income was $506.5 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to $495.0 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year. Republic's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 includes a number of charges and other (gains) expenses that impacted our results. A detail of these charges and other (gains) expenses is contained in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document. Excluding these items, net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 would have been $657.8 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, and $564.6 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, respectively.
Excluding certain charges and other (gains) expenses recorded during 2010 and 2009 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 would have been $2,517.1 million, or 31.1% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $2,509.5 million, or 30.6% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2009 period.
Revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 decreased to $8,106.6 million compared to $8,199.1 million for the same period in 2009. Core price for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 increased 1.6%, fuel surcharges increased 0.5% and commodities pricing increased 1.4%. Offsetting this revenue growth of 3.5% were decreases of 3.5% from core volume and 1.1% related to divestitures.
"In 2010, Republic Services exceeded our original financial goals and continued to expand margins," said Donald W. Slager, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong, sustainable cash flows allowed us to pay off approximately $400 million of debt, increase our dividend, and initiate a $400 million stock repurchase program. Our objectives for 2011 are to grow the business both internally and through selective acquisitions, control costs, and expand margins and free cash flow while enhancing stockholder value with dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to continuing our broad-based pricing program across all lines of business to recover increasing costs and to earn an appropriate return on our invested capital."
Republic's Board of Directors has approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on April
 
15, 2011 to stockholders of record on April 1, 2011.
Republic's guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall economy in 2011.
Specific guidance is as follows:
Our San Mateo County collection contract ended effective December 31, 2010 and the new contract was awarded in 2008 to a regional service provider. Our ten-year landfill disposal contract with the City of Toronto also ended on December 31, 2010.
Our guidance for fuel surcharges and commodities assumes pricing at December 2010 levels.

RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES
Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (EBITDA), which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is calculated as follows:
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our
 
customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.38 and $1.32 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010, respectively, compared to $0.09 and $1.30 for the comparable 2009 periods. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded a number of charges (recoveries), other expenses and net (gain) loss on disposition of assets that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc., (Net Income  Republic) and diluted earnings per share. These items primarily consist of the following:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Cash Flow
We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our free cash flow for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is calculated as follows:
 
We define adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities, less property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax, plus tax settlement payments related to BFI risk management companies. Our adjusted free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2010 is calculated as follows:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax, plus tax settlement payments related to BFI risk management companies. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows:
The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of December 31, 2010, accounts receivable was $828.9 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $50.9 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 37 (or 24 net of deferred revenue).
CASH DIVIDENDS
In October 2010, we paid a cash dividend of $76.9 million to stockholders of record as of October 1, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we recorded a dividend payable of $76.7 million to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2011, which was paid on January 18, 2011. In February 2011, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share payable to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2011, which will be paid on April 15, 2011.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In November 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $400.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2010, we used $41.1 million under the program to repurchase 1.4 million shares at an average cost per share of $28.46. We expect to use the remaining funds in this program to repurchase shares during 2011.
2011 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE
Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share
The following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 excluding loss on extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges and costs to achieve synergies and loss on the disposition of assets and impairments, net:
 
We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes loss on extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges and costs to achieve synergies and loss on the disposition of assets and impairments, net provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
We define adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities, less property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax, plus tax settlement payments related to BFI risk management companies, plus divestiture related tax payments. Our anticipated adjusted free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our actual adjusted free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2010 are calculated as follows:
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax, plus tax settlement payments related to BFI risk management companies, plus divestiture related tax payments. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our
 
cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
