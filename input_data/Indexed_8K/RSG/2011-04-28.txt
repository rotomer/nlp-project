REPUBLIC CONTACTS
...Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported net income of $158.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2011, versus $65.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year.
Phoenix, AZ, April 28, 2011
Republic's net income for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 includes a number of charges and other expenses that impacted its results. A detail of these charges and other expenses is contained in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document. Excluding these items, net income for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 would have been $159.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, and $157.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, respectively.
Excluding certain charges and other expenses recorded during 2011 and 2010 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (adjusted EBITDA) for the three months ended March 31, 2011 would have been $601.3 million, or 30.6% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $619.7 million, or 31.7% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2010 period.
 
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased to $1,964.9 million compared to $1,957.7 million for the same period in 2010. Core price for the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased 1.0%, fuel surcharges increased 0.6% and commodities pricing increased 1.0%. Offsetting this revenue growth of 2.6% were decreases of 1.4% due to the end of our San Mateo County collection contract and our disposal and transportation contract with the City of Toronto effective December 31, 2010, 0.7% from core volume and 0.1% related to divestitures.
Commenting on these results, Donald W. Slager, President and Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services, said, "Our performance in the first quarter is a direct result of the organization's continued focus on pricing, productivity improvements and customer service. This is the fourth quarter in a row we have seen sequential improvement in our collection volumes. Our free cash flow performance has allowed us to repurchase approximately 5 million shares in the quarter for approximately $148 million leaving $212 million available under the existing repurchase program which we expect to complete in 2011. We are committed to providing strong cash returns to our stockholders."
Republic also announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for stockholders of record on July 1, 2011. The dividend will be paid on July 15, 2011.

You should read the following information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. All amounts below are in millions and as a percentage of our revenue, except per share data.
REVENUE
The following table reflects our total revenue by line of business for the three months ended March 31:
The following table reflects changes in our core revenue for the three months ended March 31:
COST OF OPERATIONS
Cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel credits; disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes landfill accretion, financial assurance, leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management, which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.
The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the three months ended March 31:
 
The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems and clerical and administrative departments. Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, marketing, investor and community relations, directors' and officers' insurance, general employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges, but excludes any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges.
The following table provides the components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the three months ended March 31:
The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies.
RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion
The following table calculates earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (EBITDA), which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), for the three months ended March 31:
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash costs. EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with
 
GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.41 for the three months ended March 31, 2011 versus $0.17 for the comparable 2010 period. During the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, we recorded a number of charges, other expenses and net (gain) loss on disposition of assets that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (Net Income  Republic) and diluted earnings per share. These items primarily consist of the following:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Cash Flow
We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table calculates our free cash flow for the three months ended March 31:
We define adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities, less property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax and plus the tax settlement related to BFI risk management companies. The following table calculates our adjusted free cash flow for the three months ended March 31:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, plus merger related expenditures, net of tax and plus the settlement related to BFI risk management companies. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed such as debt service requirements and
 
dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows for the three months ended March 31:
The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of March 31, 2011, accounts receivable were $839.5 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $45.4 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 39 (or 24 net of deferred revenue).
CASH DIVIDENDS
In January 2011, we paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million to stockholders of record as of January 1, 2011. As of March 31, 2011, we recorded a dividend payable of $75.8 million to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 1, 2011, which was paid on April 15, 2011. In April 2011, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share payable to stockholders of record as of July 1, 2011, which will be paid on July 15, 2011.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In November 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $400.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2011, we had used $188.5 million under the program to repurchase 6.4 million shares at an average cost per share of $29.25. We expect to use the remaining funds in this program to repurchase shares during 2011.
