     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, each of their respective directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information; and to reimburse the Company, any Guarantor and each such director, officer, employee or controlling person for any and all expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by the Company, any Guarantor or such director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. Each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information are the following statements set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus: (i) the first sentence of the third paragraph under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the second sentence of the fifth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting", (iii) the sixth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting" and (iv) the seventh paragraph under the heading "Underwriting." The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
Indemnification of the Company.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
 
(including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded, based on advice from counsel, that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by Merrill Lynch in the case of the indemnified parties referred to in Section 8(a) and by the Company in the case of the indemnified parties referred to in Section 8(b) and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
     (d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request or disputed in good faith the indemnified party's entitlement to such reimbursement prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements.
     If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to
Section 9.
Contribution.
 
therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors, and the total discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of indemnification.
     The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discount received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A, and not joint. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the
 
Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director, officer and employee of the Company or any Guarantor and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors.
     If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportion that the aggregate principal amounts of such Securities set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase such Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Securities and the aggregate principal amount of such Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Section 10.
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters.
     As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of the federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity involving the United States, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the
Section 11.
Termination of this Agreement.
 
Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change; or (v) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
     . . Each of the Company and the Guarantors acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and each of the Company and the Guarantors is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Guarantors with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or any of the Guarantors on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or the Guarantors with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the Guarantors and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company and the Guarantors have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
Section 12
No Fiduciary Duty
     This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company, the Guarantors and the several Underwriters with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company or the Guarantors may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
     The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantors, their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement (i) will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the officers or employees of any Underwriters, or any person controlling the Underwriter, the Company, the officers or employees of the Company, or any person controlling
Section 13.

Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated or RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors, or if all of such firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
     "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, and its successors.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors, provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute for such bank another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following after the date of issuance of the Notes:
1. the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" or "group" (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries;
 
2. the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" or "group" (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, it being agreed that an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for whom shares are held under an employee stock ownership, employee retirement, employee savings or similar plan and whose shares are voted in accordance with the instructions of such employee shall not be a member of a "group" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) solely because such employee's shares are held by a trustee under said plan) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of the Company's Voting Stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of its outstanding Voting Stock;
3. the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any Person, or any Person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or Voting Stock of such other Person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the Company's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitutes, or is converted into or exchanged for, Voting Stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person immediately after giving effect to such transaction;
4. during any period of 24 consecutive calendar months, the majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors shall no longer be composed of individuals (a) who were members of the Company's Board of Directors on the first day of such period or (b) whose election or nomination to the Company's Board of Directors was approved by individuals referred to in clause (a) above constituting, at the time of such election or nomination, at least a majority of the Company's Board of Directors or, if directors are nominated by a committee of the Company's Board of Directors, constituting at the time of such nomination, at least a majority of such committee; or

     "Change of Control Triggering Event" means, with respect to the Notes, the Notes cease to be rated Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies on any date during the period (the "Trigger Period") commencing 60 days prior to the first public announcement by the Company of any Change of Control (or pending Change of Control) and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control (which Trigger Period will be extended following consummation of a Change of Control for so long as any of the Rating Agencies
 
has publicly announced that it is considering a possible ratings change). If a Rating Agency is not providing a rating for the Notes at the commencement of any Trigger Period, the Notes will be deemed to have ceased to be rated Investment Grade by such Rating Agency during that Trigger Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Change of Control Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred in connection with any particular Change of Control unless and until such Change of Control has actually been consummated.
     "Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of Moody's) and a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of S&P), and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company under the circumstances permitting the Company to select a replacement agency and in the manner for selecting a replacement agency, in each case as set forth in the definition of "Rating Agency."
     "Notes" has the meaning set forth in the Recitals.
     "Rating Agency" means each of Moody's and S&P; provided, that if any of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside the Company's control, the Company may appoint another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act as a replacement for such Rating Agency; provided, that the Company shall give notice of such appointment to the Trustee.
     "Voting Stock" of any specified Person as of any date means the capital stock of such Person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such Person.
          "Upon the Company's exercise of the option applicable to this Section 4.03 with respect to the Notes, the Company shall be released from its obligations under any covenant or provision contained or referred to in Sections 10.05, 10.06, 10.07 and 14.01, with respect to the Defeased Securities, on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 4.04 below are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and the Defeased Securities shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the
 
purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder, and the Events of Default under Section 5.01(c), (d) and (e) shall cease to be in full force and effect with respect to the Notes. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Defeased Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 5.01(c), (d) and (e) but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Defeased Securities shall be unaffected thereby."
"(l) amend, change or modify the Company's obligation to make and consummate a Change of Control Offer in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event in accordance with Section 14.01 after such Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred, including amending, changing or modifying any definition related thereto."
 
Section 14.01. REPURCHASE AT OPTION OF HOLDERS UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL
     (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to Article XI of the Indenture, each Holder of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"), subject to the rights
 
of Holders on the relevant Regular Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date.
     (b) Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurred with respect to the Notes, or at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Company will be required to send, by first class mail, a notice to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer.
     Such notice shall state:
     (c) Repurchases of Notes under this Section 14.01 shall be made, at the option of the Holder thereof, upon
 
     The Change of Control Repurchase Notice shall state:
, that if the Notes are not in certificated form, the Change of Control Repurchase Notice must comply with appropriate procedures of the Depositary.
provided, however
     (c) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
     (d) The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
Section 14.02. COMPLIANCE WITH TENDER OFFER RULES
          The Company shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached the Company's obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict."
 
          SECTION 2. The Base Indenture is incorporated by reference in full into this Second Supplemental Indenture, and all parties to this Second Supplemental Indenture agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Base Indenture as supplemented and amended by this Second Supplemental Indenture. The Base Indenture and this Second Supplemental Indenture shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.

          SECTION 3. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required to be included in this Second Supplemental Indenture by any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, such required provision shall control.
          SECTION 4. All covenants and agreements in this Second Supplemental Indenture by the Company and the Guarantors shall bind their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
          SECTION 5. In case any provision in this Second Supplemental Indenture or in the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
          SECTION 6. Nothing in this Second Supplemental Indenture, expressed or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder, and the Holders of the Notes any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Second Supplemental Indenture.
          SECTION 7. This Second Supplemental Indenture and each Note shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York and this Second Supplemental Indenture and each such Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
          SECTION 8. All terms used in this Second Supplemental Indenture not otherwise defined herein that are defined in the Base Indenture shall have the meanings set forth therein.
          SECTION 9. This Second Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page hereto by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Second Supplemental Indenture.
          SECTION 10. The recitals contained herein and in the Notes, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

          The Securities may be redeemed, as a whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time and from time to time, upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice to the Holders thereof as provided in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date, if any (subject to the right of holders of record of such Securities on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date).
          If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before the Redemption Date, the Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed, by such method the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
          In the case of any redemption of Securities in accordance with the Indenture, interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date or Special Record Date referred to on the face hereof. Securities (or portions thereof) for whose redemption and payment provision is made in accordance with the Indenture shall cease to bear interest from and after the Redemption Date.
          In the event of redemption or repurchase of this Security in accordance with the Indenture in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
          Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to Article XI of the Indenture, each Holder of the Securities shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Security pursuant to Article XIV of the Indenture.
          If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire Indebtedness on the Securities and (b) certain covenants and Defaults and Events of Default, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions (including certain amendments permitted without the consent of any Holders and certain amendments which required the consent of all of the Holders) as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders under the Indenture and the Securities at any time by the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding that are affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (100% of the Holders in certain circumstances) at the time Outstanding that are affected, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities of such series and certain past Defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company or any other obligor on the Securities (in the event such other obligor is obligated to make payments in respect of the Securities), which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, this Security at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
          The Securities in certificated form are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a differing authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
          Except as indicated in the Indenture, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
          A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
          Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

     SECTION 9. This Third Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature

          This is one of the 4.750% Notes due May 15, 2023 referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: __________
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 4.750% Notes due 2023 (herein called the "Securities"), limited (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture referred to below) in aggregate principal amount to $550,000,000, issued under and subject to the terms of an indenture (herein called the "Indenture") dated as of September 8, 2009, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 9, 2011, among the Company, the guarantors listed on the signature pages thereto (the "Guarantors") and the Trustee to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties, obligations and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
     Prior to the dated that is three months prior to their Stated Maturity, the Securities may be redeemed, as a whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time and from time to time at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date, if any (subject to the right of holders of record of such Securities on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date). On or after the date that is three months prior to their Stated Maturity, the Securities may be redeemed in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time and from time to time at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date, if any (subject to the right of holders of record of such Securities on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date).
     Any redemption may be made upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice to the Holders thereof as provided in the Indenture.
     If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before the Redemption Date, the Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed, by such method the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
     In the case of any redemption of Securities in accordance with the Indenture, interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date or Special Record Date referred to on the face hereof. Securities (or portions
 
thereof) for whose redemption and payment provision is made in accordance with the Indenture shall cease to bear interest from and after the Redemption Date.
     In the event of redemption or repurchase of this Security in accordance with the Indenture in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to Article XI of the Indenture, each Holder of the Securities shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Security pursuant to Article XIV of the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire Indebtedness on the Securities and (b) certain covenants and Defaults and Events of Default, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions (including certain amendments permitted without the consent of any Holders and certain amendments which required the consent of all of the Holders) as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders under the Indenture and the Securities at any time by the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding that are affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (100% of the Holders in certain circumstances) at the time Outstanding that are affected, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities of such series and certain past Defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company or any other obligor on the Securities (in the event such other obligor is obligated to make payments in respect of the Securities), which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, this Security at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security
 
for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Securities in certificated form are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a differing authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     Except as indicated in the Indenture, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
     Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

          NOW, THEREFORE, THIS FOURTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE WITNESSETH:
          The parties hereto mutually covenant and agree as follows:
          SECTION 1. The Base Indenture is hereby amended solely with respect to the Notes, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, as follows:
          "Independent Investment Banker" means any of Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated or RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors, or if all of such firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
          "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, and its successors.
          "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors, provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute for such bank another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
          "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
          "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following after the date of issuance of the Notes:

has publicly announced that it is considering a possible ratings change). If a Rating Agency is not providing a rating for the Notes at the commencement of any Trigger Period, the Notes will be deemed to have ceased to be rated Investment Grade by such Rating Agency during that Trigger Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Change of Control Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred in connection with any particular Change of Control unless and until such Change of Control has actually been consummated.
          "Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of Moody's) and a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of S&P), and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company under the circumstances permitting the Company to select a replacement agency and in the manner for selecting a replacement agency, in each case as set forth in the definition of "Rating Agency."
          "Notes" has the meaning set forth in the Recitals.
          "Rating Agency" means each of Moody's and S&P; provided, that if any of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside the Company's control, the Company may appoint another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act as a replacement for such Rating Agency; provided, that the Company shall give notice of such appointment to the Trustee.

Dated: __________
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 5.700% Notes due 2041 (herein called the "Securities"), limited (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture referred to below) in aggregate principal amount to $600,000,000, issued under and subject to the terms of an indenture (herein called the "Indenture") dated as of September 8, 2009, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 9, 2011, among the Company, the guarantors listed on the signature pages thereto (the "Guarantors") and the Trustee to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties, obligations and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
          Prior to the dated that is six months prior to their Stated Maturity, the Securities may be redeemed, as a whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time and from time to time at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date, if any (subject to the right of holders of record of such Securities on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date). On or after the date that is six months prior to their Stated Maturity, the Securities may be redeemed in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time and from time to time at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date, if any (subject to the right of holders of record of such Securities on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date).
          Any redemption may be made upon not less than 30 and not more than 60 days' notice to the Holders thereof as provided in the Indenture.
          If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before the Redemption Date, the Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed, by such method the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
          In the case of any redemption of Securities in accordance with the Indenture, interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date or Special Record Date referred to on the face hereof. Securities (or portions
 
thereof) for whose redemption and payment provision is made in accordance with the Indenture shall cease to bear interest from and after the Redemption Date.
          In the event of redemption or repurchase of this Security in accordance with the Indenture in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
          Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities pursuant to Article XI of the Indenture, each Holder of the Securities shall have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Security pursuant to Article XIV of the Indenture.
          If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire Indebtedness on the Securities and (b) certain covenants and Defaults and Events of Default, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions (including certain amendments permitted without the consent of any Holders and certain amendments which required the consent of all of the Holders) as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders under the Indenture and the Securities at any time by the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding that are affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (100% of the Holders in certain circumstances) at the time Outstanding that are affected, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities of such series and certain past Defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and the Securities and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company or any other obligor on the Securities (in the event such other obligor is obligated to make payments in respect of the Securities), which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, this Security at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security
 
for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a differing authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
          Except as indicated in the Indenture, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
          A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

     We have acted as counsel for Republic Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% notes due May 15, 2018 (the "2018 Notes"), $550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% notes due May 15, 2023 (the "2023 Notes") and $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.700% notes due May 15, 2041 (the "2041 Notes" and, together with the 2018 Notes and the 2023 Notes, the "Notes") as set forth in the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 2, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally (the "Guarantees"), by each of the Company's subsidiaries that is a party to the supplemental indentures referred to below (the "Guarantors").
     The Notes and Guarantees will be issued under an Indenture, dated September 8, 2009, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by (i) a Second Supplemental Indenture among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee relating to the 2018 Notes to be dated May 9, 2011, (ii) a Third Supplemental Indenture among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee relating to the 2023 Notes to be dated May 9, 2011 and (iii) a Fourth Supplemental Indenture among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee relating to the 2041 Notes to be dated May 9, 2011.
     In connection with our opinion, we have examined: (a) the Prospectus Supplement; (b) the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, each as amended to date; (c) the Indenture; (d) the form of the Notes; and (e) such other proceedings, documents and records as we have deemed necessary to enable us to render this opinion.
     In our examination of the above referenced documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents, certificates and instruments submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. Also, we have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and Guarantors and other sources believed by us to be responsible.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the matters set forth herein, assuming that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents the valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee, we are of the opinion that:
     1. Upon the due execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Notes, and the receipt of the consideration therefor set forth in the Prospectus Supplement, the Notes will be valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms; except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other comparable laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or the application of equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     2.  Upon the due execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Notes, and the receipt of the consideration therefor set forth in the Prospectus Supplement, the Guarantees will be the valid and binding obligations of the Guarantors entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with their terms; except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other comparable laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or the application of equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     We express no opinion concerning the contents of the Prospectus Supplement, other than as to the validity of the Notes and the Guarantees. We express no opinion as to the applicability of, compliance with or effect of, the law of any jurisdiction other than United States Federal law, the laws of the States of Illinois, New York, California, North Carolina and Texas and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and have assumed the due authorization of the Guarantees by each of those Guarantors organized in a jurisdiction other than the foregoing.
     We hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement, and to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act.
