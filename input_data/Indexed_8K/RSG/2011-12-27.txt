Employment Agreement
 
 
4. . This award of Restricted Stock Units is subject to the following terms and conditions:
Terms and Conditions
(a) .
Payment for Restricted Stock Units; Forfeiture of Unvested Units; Deferral of Restricted Stock Units
(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (ii) of this Section 4(a), Section 4(d) or Section 14 hereof, the Recipient shall receive one share of Common Stock for each vested Restricted Stock Unit awarded hereunder, free and clear of the restrictions set forth in this Agreement, except for any restrictions necessary to comply with federal and state securities laws. Certificates (or other indicia of ownership) representing such shares shall be delivered to the Recipient as promptly as practical (but in no event more than 30 days) following the date on which the portion of the Restricted Stock Units to which the distribution relates becomes vested. Any Restricted Stock Units that are not vested as of the Recipient's separation from service, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations (the "Separation from Service"), and that will not become vested pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, shall automatically and immediately be forfeited on the date of the Recipient's Separation from Service.
(ii) The Recipient may elect to defer the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Republic Services, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"), and if the Recipient properly and timely does so, the Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically converted into a corresponding number of units under the Republic Services Stock Unit Fund (the "Units"), and shall be credited to the Participant's Account Balance (as defined in the Deferred Compensation Plan) in accordance with Section 3.9(c) of the Deferred Compensation Plan as may be amended from time to time. The Units shall remain subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in Sections 3 and 4(h) of this Agreement. The Units shall be payable in actual shares of Common Stock or cash at the times provided for under the Deferred Compensation Plan as may be amended from time to time.
(b) . The Restricted Stock Units awarded herein do not represent an equity security of the Company and do not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the right to receive Dividend Equivalents in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof.
Hypothetical Nature of Restricted Stock Units
(c) . Recipient shall receive Dividend Equivalents in the form of additional Restricted Stock Units or fractional Restricted Stock Units each time a dividend or other distribution is paid on the Company's Common Stock. The number of Restricted Stock Units awarded for a cash dividend or non-cash dividend other than a stock
Dividend Equivalents
 
 
dividend shall be determined by (i) multiplying the number of Restricted Stock Units held by the Recipient pursuant to this Agreement as of the dividend payment date by the amount of the dividend per share of Common Stock and (ii) dividing the product so determined by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the dividend payment date. The number of Restricted Stock Units awarded for a stock dividend shall be determined by multiplying the number of Restricted Stock Units held by the Recipient pursuant to this Agreement as of the dividend payment date by the number of additional shares of Common Stock actually paid as a dividend per share of Common Stock. Any additional Restricted Stock Units awarded pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall be awarded effective the day following the date the dividend was paid, and shall have the same status, and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including without limitation the vesting and forfeiture provisions), under this Agreement as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate, and shall be distributed on the same payment date referred to in Section 4(a) herein as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate. In no event shall the Recipient be entitled to receive any Dividend Equivalent with respect to any dividend or other distribution for which the dividend payment date is after the date of the Recipient's Separation from Service.
(d) . If the Recipient experiences an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency, the Recipient may petition the Committee to receive the payment of shares of Common Stock for all or part of his vested Restricted Stock Units prior to his Separation from Service. If the Committee, in its sole discretion, grants the Recipient's petition, then the Recipient shall only receive shares of Common Stock as necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency to the extent deemed necessary by the Committee. "Unforeseeable Financial Emergency" shall mean a severe financial hardship to the Recipient resulting from (i) an illness or accident of the Recipient, the Recipient's spouse, or the Recipient's dependent (as defined in Section 152 of the Code, without regard to Section 152(b)(1), (b)(2), or (d)(1)(B) of the Code), (ii) a loss of the Recipient's property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by insurance), or (iii) similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Recipient, all as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
Unforeseeable Financial Emergency
(e) .
Tax Withholding
(i) The Recipient shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the grant of Restricted Stock Units (including without limitation the vesting thereof) and any Dividend Equivalents or other distributions made by the Company to the Recipient with respect to the Restricted Stock Units as and when the Company determines those amounts to be due, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Recipient any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Dividend Equivalents or other distributions made by the Company to the Recipient with respect to any Restricted Stock Units.
 
 
(ii) The Recipient may elect, by notice to the Committee, to satisfy his or her minimum withholding tax obligation with respect to the granting or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units by the Company's withholding a portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Recipient, such shares being valued at their fair market value as of the date on which the taxable event that gives rise to the withholding requirement occurs, or by the Recipient's delivery to the Company of a portion of the shares previously delivered by the Company, such shares being valued at their fair market value as of the date of delivery of such shares by the Recipient to the Company.
(f) . This Agreement does not confer upon the Recipient any right with respect to continuance of employment or service by the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the Recipient's employment at any time.
No Right to Continued Employment or Service
(g) .
Transferability of Awards
(i) . No Restricted Stock Units shall be transferable or assignable by the Recipient, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code.
Restrictions on Transfer
(ii) . No transfer permitted under Section 4(g)(i), of any Restricted Stock Units, shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (1) the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Transfer attached hereto as executed and dated by the Recipient (or the executor or personal representative of the deceased Recipient's estate) and with a copy of the will, assignment or transfer document and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer, and (2) the Statement of Acknowledgement attached hereto as executed and dated by the transferee which states that the transferee will comply with all the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Agreement relating to the Restricted Stock Units that are or would have been applicable to the Recipient.
Notice
Exhibit A
Exhibit B
(h) . The Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to Section 17(n) of the Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Recipient engages in any Detrimental Activity at any time prior to or during the one year period after the latest date on which any portion of the Restricted Stock Units become vested but prior to a Change in Control, the Company shall, upon the recommendation of the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion, be entitled to (i) immediately terminate and cancel any portion of the Restricted Stock Units that have not

Awards shall also be subject to cancellation and/or clawback by the Committee if and to the extent required by applicable law.
(i) . By accepting this Agreement, the Recipient consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company owes the Recipient from time to time (including amounts owed to the Recipient as wages or other compensation, for any benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to the Recipient by the Company), up to the dollar amount the Recipient owes the Company under Section 4(h) hereof. Whether or not the Company elects to make any set off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set off the full amount the Recipient owes the Company calculated as set forth in Section 4(h) hereof, the Recipient agrees to pay immediately the unpaid balance to the Company.
Right to Set Off
(j) . The Recipient may be released from his or her obligations under Sections 4(h) and 4(i) hereof only if the Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such action is not adverse to the interests of the Company.

In the event of a change in the Common Stock as presently constituted, which is limited to a change in all of its authorized shares without par value into the same number of shares with par value, the shares resulting from any such change shall be deemed to be the Common Stock within the meaning of the Plan.
(c) . The award of Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge or to consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate or sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
Other Adjustments

(e) . The Director shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the grant of Restricted Stock Units (including without limitation the vesting thereof) and any Dividend Equivalents or other distributions made by the Company to the Director with respect to the Restricted Stock Units as and when the Company determines those amounts to be due, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Director any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Dividend Equivalents or other distributions made by the Company to the Director with respect to any Restricted Stock Units.

Terms and Conditions
(a) . Except as otherwise provided in Section 4(d) or Section 14 hereof, at the time of the Director's
Payment for Restricted Stock Units; Forfeiture of Unvested Units
 
 
separation from service, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations (the "Separation from Service"), the Director shall receive one share of Common Stock for each vested Restricted Stock Unit awarded hereunder, free and clear of the restrictions set forth in this Agreement, except for any restrictions necessary to comply with federal and state securities laws. Certificates (or other indicia of ownership) representing such shares shall be delivered to the Director as promptly as practical (but in no event more than 30 days) following the Director's Separation from Service. Any Restricted Stock Units that are not vested as of the Director's Separation from Service shall automatically and immediately be forfeited on the date of the Director's Separation from Service.
(b) . The Restricted Stock Units awarded herein do not represent an equity security of the Company and do not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the right to receive Dividend Equivalents in accordance with Section 4(c) hereof.
Hypothetical Nature of Restricted Stock Units
(c) . Director shall receive Dividend Equivalents in the form of additional Restricted Stock Units or fractional Restricted Stock Units each time a dividend or other distribution is paid on the Company's Common Stock. The number of Restricted Stock Units awarded for a cash dividend or non-cash dividend other than a stock dividend shall be determined by (i) multiplying the number of Restricted Stock Units held by the Director pursuant to this Agreement as of the dividend payment date by the amount of the dividend per share of Common Stock and (ii) dividing the product so determined by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the dividend payment date. The number of Restricted Stock Units awarded for a stock dividend shall be determined by multiplying the number of Restricted Stock Units held by the Director pursuant to this Agreement as of the dividend payment date by the number of additional shares of Common Stock actually paid as a dividend per share of Common Stock. Any additional Restricted Stock Units awarded pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall be awarded effective the day following the date the dividend was paid, and shall have the same status, and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including without limitation the vesting and forfeiture provisions), under this Agreement as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate, and shall be distributed on the same payment date referred to in Section 4(a) herein as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate. In no event shall the Director be entitled to receive any Dividend Equivalent with respect to any dividend or other distribution for which the dividend payment date is after the Director's Separation from Service.
Dividend Equivalents
(d) . If the Director experiences an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency, the Director may petition the Committee to receive the payment of shares of Common Stock for all or part of his vested Restricted Stock Units prior to his Separation from Service. If the Committee, in its sole discretion, grants the Director's petition, then the Director shall only receive shares of Common Stock as necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency to the extent deemed necessary by the Committee (excluding the Director, if the Director is a member of the Committee). "Unforeseeable Financial Emergency" shall mean a severe financial hardship to the Director resulting from (i) an illness or accident of the Director, the Director's spouse, or the Director's dependent (as
Unforeseeable Financial Emergency
 
 
defined in Section 152 of the Code, without regard to Section 152(b)(1), (b)(2), or (d)(1)(B) of the Code), (ii) a loss of the Director's property due to casualty (including the need to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by insurance), or (iii) similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Director, all as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
(e) . The Director shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the grant of Restricted Stock Units (including without limitation the vesting thereof) and any Dividend Equivalents or other distributions made by the Company to the Director with respect to the Restricted Stock Units as and when the Company determines those amounts to be due, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Director any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Dividend Equivalents or other distributions made by the Company to the Director with respect to any Restricted Stock Units.
Tax Withholding

No Right to Renomination
(g) .
Transferability of Award

Restrictions on Transfer
(ii) . No transfer permitted under Section 4(g)(i) of any Restricted Stock Units shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (1) the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Transfer attached hereto as executed and dated by the Director (or the executor or personal representative of the deceased Director's estate) and with a copy of the will, assignment or transfer document and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer, and (2) the Statement of Acknowledgement attached hereto as executed and dated by the transferee which states that the transferee will comply with all the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Agreement relating to the Restricted Stock Units that are or would have been applicable to the Director.

Forfeiture by Reason of Detrimental Activity
 
 
upon the recommendation of the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, be entitled to (i) immediately terminate and cancel any portion of the Restricted Stock Units that have not previously been settled with shares of Common Stock, and/or (ii) require within two (2) years after the latest date on which any portion of the Restricted Stock Units are settled but prior to a Change in Control that the Director (1) return to the Company any shares of Common Stock that were distributed to the Director in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, or if such shares of Common Stock are not still owned by the Director, that the Director pay to the Company an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares of Common Stock on the date they were issued, and (2) return to the Company any cash or other property (other than Common Stock) received by the Director from the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Awards shall also be subject to cancellation and/or clawback by the Committee if and to the extent required under applicable law.
(i) . By accepting this Agreement, the Director consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company owes the Director from time to time (including amounts owed to the Director as wages or other compensation, for any benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to the Director by the Company), up to the dollar amount the Director owes the Company under Section 4(h) hereof. Whether or not the Company elects to make any set off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set off the full amount the Director owes the Company calculated as set forth in Section 4(h) hereof, the Director agrees to pay immediately the unpaid balance to the Company.
Right to Set Off
(j) . The Director may be released from his or her obligations under Sections 4(h) and 4(i) hereof only if the Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such action is not adverse to the interests of the Company.
