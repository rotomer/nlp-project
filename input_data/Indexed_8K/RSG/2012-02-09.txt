REPUBLIC CONTACTS
 
 
PHOENIX, AZ, February 9, 2012, Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported net income of $191.0 million, or $0.51 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2011, versus $147.6 million, or $0.38 per share, for the comparable period last year.
Republic's net income for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 includes a number of charges and other expenses that impacted its results. A detail of these charges and other expenses is contained in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document. Excluding these items, net income for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 would have been $195.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, and $160.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, respectively.
Excluding certain charges and other expenses recorded during 2011 and 2010 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (adjusted EBITDA) for the three months ended December 31, 2011 would have been $603.6 million, or 29.8% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $616.8 million, or 30.5% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2010 period.
 
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2011 increased to $2,025.2 million compared to $2,020.8 million for the same period in 2010. Core price for the three months ended December 31, 2011 increased 0.6%, fuel recovery fees increased 1.0% and acquisitions / divestitures, net increased 0.3%. Partially offsetting this revenue growth of 1.9% were decreases in recycling commodities pricing of 0.1%, volume of 0.2% and 1.4% due to the end of our San Mateo County collection contract and our disposal and transportation contract with the City of Toronto effective December 31, 2010.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income was $589.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, versus $506.5 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year.
Republic's net income for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 includes a number of charges and other expenses that impacted its results.

Excluding these items, net income for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 would have been $738.3 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, and $657.8 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, respectively.
Excluding certain charges and other expenses recorded during 2011 and 2010 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been $2,502.4 million, or 30.5% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $2,517.1 million, or 31.1% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2010 period.
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to $8,192.9 million compared to $8,106.6 million for 2010. Core price for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 0.8%, fuel recovery fees increased 1.0%, commodities pricing increased 1.0% and acquisitions / divestitures, net increased 0.1%. Partially offsetting this revenue growth of 2.9% were decreases of 0.4% from core volume and 1.4% due to the end of our San Mateo County collection contract and our disposal and transportation contract with the City of Toronto effective December 31, 2010.
"I am very pleased with our 2011 performance," said Donald W. Slager, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong operational focus allowed the Company to achieve a record level of free cash flow. We continue to have a disciplined approach in the utilization of cash flow, which includes re-investing in our business, acquisitions and returning cash through share repurchases and dividends. During 2011, Republic returned approximately $770 million to its owners through repurchases and dividends. We remain focused on improving
 
our return on capital through pricing that exceeds cost increases and initiatives that enhance our productivity. Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our strong credit profile and investment grade ratings as we continue to grow the business."
Republic also announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for stockholders of record on April 2, 2012. The dividend will be paid on April 16, 2012.
Republic's guidance is based on current economic conditions which assume modest improvement in the overall economy in 2012. Please refer to the Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this document.
Specific guidance is as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Our guidance for fuel recovery fees and commodities assumes pricing at December 2011 levels.
 
 
 
Mr. Slager, commenting on the Company's priorities, stated, "In 2012, we will continue to focus on and invest in productivity and cost improvement projects that will enhance our customers' experience with Republic. These projects include investing in automated collection vehicles, implementing a standardized maintenance program and expanding our fleet of natural gas vehicles. We also will continue to invest in people who assure our success with customers and allow us to be an employer of choice for top talent."

The following table reflects changes in our revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31:

It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel credits; disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes landfill accretion, financial assurance, leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management, which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.

RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion
The following table calculates earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (EBITDA), which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), for the three and twelve months ended December 31:
 
 
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.51 and $1.56 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 versus $0.38 and $1.32 for the comparable 2010 periods. We recorded a number of charges, other expenses and net (gain) loss on disposition of assets that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (Net Income  Republic) and diluted earnings per share; these items primarily consist of the following:
 
During December 2011, we reached a settlement with the IRS on the treatment of a transaction involving partnership interests that were exchanged by Allied in 2002. Also during December 2011, the IRS completed its examination of Allied's 2000 through 2003 tax years. The resolution of these matters reduced our effective tax rate for the quarter and year.
We believe that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our
 
results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Cash Flow
We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table calculates our free cash flow for the three and twelve months ended December 31:
 
Adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, for the twelve months ended December 31, is calculated in the following table:
 
We believe that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain expenditures. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows for the three and twelve months ended December 31:
 
The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, accounts receivable were $825.8 million and $828.9 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $48.1 million and $50.9 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 37 (or 24 net of deferred revenue) and 37 (or 24 net of deferred revenue), respectively.
 
CASH DIVIDENDS
In October 2011, we paid a cash dividend of $81.6 million to stockholders of record as of October 3, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a dividend payable of $81.4 million to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2012, which was paid on January 17, 2012. In February 2012, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid on April 16, 2012 to stockholders of record on April 2, 2012.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In August 2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our common stock through December 31, 2013. This authorization is in addition to the $400 million repurchase program authorized in November 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had used $500.8 million under the programs to repurchase 17.1 million shares at an average cost per share of $29.21.
As of December 31, 2011, we had 369.9 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
2012 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE
Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share
The following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding loss on extinguishment of debt, and loss on the disposition of assets and impairments, net:
 
We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes loss on extinguishment of debt, and loss on the disposition of assets and impairments, net provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Our anticipated adjusted free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our actual adjusted free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2011, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, are calculated as follows:
 
 
We anticipate our adjusted free cash flow for 2012 will decrease from 2011 due to an increase in cash paid for income taxes of approximately $140 million primarily due to bonus depreciation.
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows:
 
We believe that the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain expenditures. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
