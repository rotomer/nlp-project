% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") that it will redeem all of the Notes outstanding on June 1, 2012 (the "Redemption Date").
The Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 103.438% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the Redemption Date. Payment of the redemption price will be made by U.S. Bank National Association, the trustee under the indenture governing the Notes, on the Redemption Date upon presentation and surrender of the Notes as set forth in the redemption notice.
The Company intends to use incremental borrowings under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand to fund the redemption. The Company may explore capital market opportunities to fund the redemption if market conditions are favorable.
The Company expects to incur a charge upon extinguishment of the Notes of approximately $97 million, of which $26 million is the cash premium and $71 million is the unamortized discount associated with these Notes. This charge will be reflected in the Company's second quarter 2012 financial results.
