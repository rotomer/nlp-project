On May 8, 2012, Republic Services, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer and the other lenders party thereto (the "Amended and Restated Credit Facility"), which replaces the Company's $1.25 billion credit facility maturing in September 2013.
The Amended and Restated Credit Facility is unsecured and will mature in May 2017. It includes a feature that allows the Company to increase availability under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, at the Company's option, by an aggregate amount of up to $500 million, through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders, subject to obtaining additional commitments and other customary conditions. At the Company's option, borrowings bear interest at a base rate or a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on the Company's debt ratings. Available amounts subject to outstanding letters of credit, and outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, may be accelerated upon the occurrence of customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment defaults, failures to comply with covenants, material inaccuracies of representations or warranties, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, changes of control, ERISA matters and cross-defaults to other debt agreements.
The Amended and Restated Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios (including a minimum EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, to interest ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, ratio). The Company may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if it is in compliance with these covenants.
In addition, on May 8, 2012, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 ("Amendment No. 1") to its existing $1.25 billion credit facility (the "Existing Credit Facility"), by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and each of the lenders signatory thereto. Amendment No. 1 does not extend the maturity date of the Existing Credit Facility, which matures in April 2016, but does reduce the commitments under the Existing Credit Facility to $1.0 billion and conforms certain terms of the Existing Credit Facility with those of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility.
In connection with entering into the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and Amendment No. 1, the guarantees by the Company's subsidiary guarantors with respect to the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the Existing Credit Facility have been released. As a result, the guarantees by the Company's subsidiary guarantors with respect to all of the Company's outstanding senior notes, with an outstanding principal amount of $5.6 billion, were automatically released. In addition, the guarantees by all of the Company's subsidiary guarantors (other than Allied Waste Industries, Inc. and Allied Waste North America, Inc.) with respect to the 9.25% debentures and the 7.40% debentures issued by the Company's subsidiary Browning-Ferris Industries, LLC (successor to Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.) also were automatically released. You should read Note 7 to the interim financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 (filed April 27, 2012) for a listing of the Company's outstanding senior notes and debentures.

On May 8, 2012, the Company amended its $1.25 billion Existing Credit Facility; the information required by Item 2.03 of Form 8-K is included in Item 1.01 of this report.

3.02 Illegality
 
authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the Borrower's option, prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (or, if applicable, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
. If for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (a) the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (b) the Administrative Agent determines that the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
