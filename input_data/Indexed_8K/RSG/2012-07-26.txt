Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported net income of $149.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the three months ended June
 
30, 2012, versus $46.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year.
Republics net income for the three months ended June
 
30, 2012 and 2011 includes a number of charges and other expenses that impacted its results. A detail of these charges and other expenses is contained in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document. Excluding these items, net income for the three months ended June
 
30, 2012 and 2011 would have been $218.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, and $184.9 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, respectively.
Excluding certain charges and other expenses recorded during 2012 and 2011 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (adjusted EBITDA) for the three months ended June
 
30, 2012 would have been $624.7 million, or 30.3% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $648.7 million, or 31.1% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2011 period.

Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2012 decreased to $2,060.6 million compared to $2,086.6 million for the same period in 2011. This decrease in revenue of 1.2% was made up of decreases in fuel surcharges of 0.1%, volumes of 1.3% and recycling commodities pricing of 1.0%, partially offset by increases in core price of 0.6% and acquisitions, net of divestitures of 0.6%.
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net income was $292.1 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, versus $204.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year.
Republics net income for the six months ended June
 
30, 2012 and 2011 includes a number of charges, other expenses and benefits that impacted its results. A detail of these charges, other expenses and benefits is contained in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document. Excluding these items, net income for the six months ended June
 
30, 2012 and 2011 would have been $359.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, and $344.5 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, respectively.
Excluding certain charges and other expenses recorded during 2012 and 2011 as described in the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Measures section of this document, adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June
 
30, 2012 would have been $1,181.6 million, or 29.2% as a percentage of revenue, compared to $1,250.0 million, or 30.9% as a percentage of revenue, for the comparable 2011 period.
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2012 decreased to $4,043.0 million compared to $4,051.5 million for the same period in 2011. This decrease in revenue of 0.2% was made up of decreases in volumes of 0.6% and recycling commodities pricing of 0.9%, partially offset by increases in core price of 0.6%, fuel surcharges of 0.2%, and acquisitions, net of divestitures of 0.5%.
Republic is updating its full year 2012 earnings guidance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $1.91 to $1.93. This guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 36.0%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes a number of charges, other expenses and benefits, as described in the 2012 Updated Financial Guidance section of this document.
Commenting on these results, Donald W. Slager, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, We are on track to exceed the earnings guidance that we provided in April due to the settlement of Allieds 2004 - 2008 tax years. Mr. Slager also stated, The business is operating within our expectations. We achieved 30.3% EBITDA margins in the quarter, continued to see a stronger pace of acquisition activity and completed our
2
refinancing activities. As a result of these refinancings, we do not have a significant debt maturity until 2016. We also returned $223 million of free cash flow to our owners through share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter.
Company Declares Quarterly Dividend
Republic also announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.235 per share, an increase of approximately 7% over the prior quarter, for stockholders of record on October 1, 2012. The dividend will be paid on October 15, 2012.

All amounts below are in millions and as a percentage of our revenue, except per share data.
REVENUE
The following table reflects our total revenue by line of business for the three and six months ended June 30:
The following table reflects changes in our core revenue for the three and six months ended June 30:
COST OF OPERATIONS
Cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel credits; disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management, which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems and clerical and administrative departments.

The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
During the three months ended June 30, 2012, we settled with the IRS appeals division all tax issues, including the 2002 exchange of partnership matter, related to Allieds 2004  2008 tax years. This settlement reduced the second quarter income tax provision by $34 million.
RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion
The following table calculates earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion (EBITDA), which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), for the three and six months ended June 30:
8
We believe that presenting EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted Earnings
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.40 and $0.79 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 versus $0.12 and $0.54 for the comparable 2011 periods. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, we recorded a number of charges, other expenses and net (gain) loss on disposition of assets that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (Net Income  Republic) and diluted earnings per share.  These items primarily consist of the following:
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, we incurred costs related to the negotiation of certain collective bargaining agreements under which we have obligations to contribute to the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (Central States). As part of these negotiations, we have proposed to withdraw from Central States. We do not know what the ultimate outcome of the negotiations will be.
We believe that presenting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful,
9
in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services Inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table calculates our free cash flow for the three and six months ended June 30:
The following table calculates our adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, for the six months ended June 30:
We believe that presenting adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain expenditures. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows for the three and six months ended June 30:
The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
10
As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, accounts receivable were $845.3 million and $872.3 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $45.2 million and $47.1 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of approximately 37 (or 23 net of deferred revenue) and 38 (or 25 net of deferred revenue), respectively.
CASH DIVIDENDS
In April 2012, we paid a cash dividend of $81.6 million to stockholders of record as of April 2, 2011. As of June 30, 2012, we recorded a dividend payable of $80.4 million to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 2, 2012, which was paid on July 16, 2012. In July 2012, our board of directors approved an increase in the regular quarterly dividend of approximately 7%. The quarterly dividend of $0.235 per share will be paid on October 15, 2012 to stockholders of record on October 1, 2012.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In August 2011, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $750.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through December 31, 2013. This authorization is in addition to the $400.0 million repurchase program authorized in November 2010. From November 2010 to June 30, 2012, we repurchased 23.5 million shares of our stock for $672.6 million at a weighted average cost per share of $28.67. During the three months ended June 30, 2012, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of our stock for $163.2 million at a weighted average cost per share of $27.06.
As of June 30, 2012, we had 365.3 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
2012 UPDATED FINANCIAL GUIDANCE
Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share
The following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2012 which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP:
We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes loss on extinguishment of debt, negotiation costs  Central States and gain on disposition of assets and impairments, net, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
