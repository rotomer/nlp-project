Executive Separation Policy
(Amended as of March 29, 2012)
Purpose
Republic Services, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliated and related entities (collectively, the Company) seeks to attract and retain the most qualified and capable professionals to serve in key executive positions to maximize the value of the Company for the benefit of the Companys stockholders. To achieve this goal, the Company has established an Executive Separation Policy to provide such employees with financial security and sufficient incentive to accept and continue employment. This Policy describes the separation benefits that the Company will provide to key executives under certain circumstances if their employment ends. The Company also seeks to ensure that the separation process is handled professionally and efficiently.
Covered Employees
This Policy applies to (i) the Chief Executive Officer, (ii) the President, (iii) the Chief Operating Officer, (iv) the Chief Financial Officer, and (v) the General Counsel (each a Senior Executive Officer or SEO). It also applies to (i) Executive Vice Presidents (EVP), (ii) Senior Vice Presidents (SVP), (iii) Vice Presidents (VP), and (iv) Area Presidents (AP) (Key Executive Employees or KEEs). (SEOs and KEEs under this Policy will be referred to collectively as Covered Executives). The terms SEO and KEE are used solely for purposes of this Policy and not for any other purpose.
The Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) may designate other persons holding other executive positions as Covered Executives under this Policy. Upon such designation, the Compensation Committee will specify the executive position category to be used under this Policy to determine the level of pay and benefits to be provided to the Covered Executive under this Policy.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Policy to the contrary, this Policy does not apply to any Covered Executive if the Covered Executive has an employment agreement, offer letter, or other agreement with the Company which governs the terms and conditions applicable to the Covered Executives separation from the Company and is in effect immediately prior to his or her termination of employment (Employment Agreement).

) day after the termination date or such later date as required under the Section 409A provisions set forth below, a lump sum amount equal to: (x) one year of the VP/AP's then current base salary, and (y) one times the VP/AP's target annual bonus, if any, as such target is set under the Company's executive incentive plan, for the year in which the termination date occurs;
(3)
The VP/AP's stock options and other equity awards that remain outstanding as of the termination date will become 100% fully vested and exercisable on the termination date and remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the termination date, but not beyond the original term of the option or other awards;
(4)
If the VP/AP and/or the VP/AP's spouse and dependents are enrolled in the Company's medical, dental and/or vision plan as of the termination date, the VP/AP and/or the VP/AP's spouse and dependents will continue to participate in those plans (whichever applicable) in accordance with the terms of such plans as they may be amended from time to time, at the same cost applicable to active VPs or APs (as applicable), until the earliest of: (i) the date the VP/AP becomes eligible for any comparable medical, dental, or vision coverage provided by another employer, (ii) the date the VP/AP becomes eligible for Medicare or any similar government-sponsored or provided health care program, or (iii) the first anniversary of the termination date; and
(5)
All long term incentive grants, if any, provided to VP/AP will immediately vest as if all target performance levels had been met, as such targets are set under the Company's executive incentive plan, and will be paid at target by the Company to the VP/AP (unless previously paid) at such time as the Company would have been required to make such payments if the termination of employment had not occurred.
Eligibility For Separation Benefits
6
The Company's obligations to provide any separation benefits under this Policy are contingent upon the following:
A.    Covered Executive's execution of the following documents in such form as provided by the Company and within the time required by the Company:
(1)
a valid, enforceable, full and unconditional release of all claims whether known or unknown that the Covered Executive may have against the Company, its officers, fiduciaries, directors, agents, and other employees as of the termination date;
(2)
the Company's Noncompetition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality, and Arbitration Agreement;
B.    After the Covered Executive's termination date, except as required by applicable law or in the context of a legal proceeding, the Covered Executive will not directly or indirectly: 1) disparage or say or write negative things about the Company, its officers, directors, agents, or other employees; 2) initiate or participate in any discussion or communication that reflects negatively on the Company, its officers, directors, agents, or other employees; or 3) engage in any other activity that the Company considers detrimental to its interests. For purposes of this Policy, a disparaging or
negative statement is any communication, oral or written, which would tend to cause the recipient of the communication to question the business condition, integrity, competence, fairness, or good character of the person or entity to which the communication relates; and
C.    After the termination date, the Covered Executive's reasonable assistance and cooperation with the Company concerning business or legal related matters about which Covered Executive possesses relevant knowledge or information. Such cooperation will be provided only at the Company's specific request and will include, but not be limited to, assisting or advising the Company with respect to any business-related matters or any actual or threatened legal action (including testifying in depositions, hearings, and/or trials). In addition, the Covered Executive agrees to promptly inform the Company (by telephonic or written communication to Republic Services, Inc., Legal Department, 18500 North Allied Way, Phoenix, AZ 85054, phone number 480-627-2714) if any person or business contacts Covered Executive in an effort to obtain information about the Company; and
D.    The Company's obligation to pay separation pay and benefits under this Policy will cease immediately if the Company determines that Covered Executive failed to comply with any of the foregoing conditions.
7
Section 409A
For purposes of this Policy a termination of employment means a separation from service as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and accompanying Treasury Regulations (Section 409A). If at the time of the employment termination the Covered Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable as a result of such employment termination is necessary to avoid the additional tax under Section 409A, the Company will defer the payment or commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Covered Executive) until the first bi-weekly payroll date that is at least six (6) months following the employment termination. Any payment amounts deferred will be accumulated and paid to the Covered Executive (without interest) on the first bi-weekly payroll date that is at least six (6) months after the employment termination in a lump sum, and the balance of payments due to the Covered Executive will be paid as otherwise provided in this Policy. Each bi-weekly payment will be designated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. In the event that the Covered Executive is eligible to receive continuation of medical, dental and/or vision benefits under this Policy for a period of more than 18 months, such benefits will meet the following requirements: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement provided to Covered Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Covered Executive in any other calendar year, (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Covered Executive is entitled to be reimbursed will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (iii) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. This Policy will be interpreted and administered in accordance with Section 409A, although nothing in this Policy will be construed as an entitlement to or guarantee of any particular tax treatment to the Covered Executive.
Best Results Calculation
In the event that any payment, deemed payment or other benefit pursuant to this Policy, together with any other payment, deemed payment or other benefit the Covered Executive may receive under any other plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement (collectively, Payment) would (a) constitute an excess parachute payment under section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) (an Excess Parachute Payment), and (b) but for this paragraph would result in the imposition on the Covered Executive of an excise tax under section 4999 of the Code or similar provision of state or local law (the Excise Tax), then the Payment made to the Covered Executive shall either be (1) delivered in full, or (2) delivered in such amount thereby resulting in no portion of such Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, that results in the receipt by the Covered Executive on an after-tax basis the greatest amount of Payment, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such Payment may be taxable under section 4999 of the Code. In the event of a reduction as described in (2) above, the Covered Executive's cash payments under this Policy shall be reduced to the extent necessary starting with the earliest scheduled payment, and such reduction shall not affect the timing of any payments that are not reduced.
ERISA Provisions
8
This Policy is intended to be a top hat welfare plan within the meaning of U.S. Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104-24. The claims procedure set forth in Section 2560.503-1 of such regulations are hereby incorporated by reference into this Policy.
Governing Law
The rights and obligations of the Covered Executives and the Company under this Policy will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Arizona without regard to choice of law principles and to the extent not preempted by ER1SA.
Integration
Except as provided in the third paragraph under Covered Employees on Page 1 of this Policy, this Policy replaces all previous Employment Agreements, between the Covered Executive and the Company and constitutes the entire understanding between the Covered Executive and the Company with respect to the payment of pay and benefits upon termination of employment.
Reservation of Rights
Prior to a Change in Control, this Policy may be modified from time to time, or terminated in its entirety, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. Any modifications made by the Compensation Committee for any Covered Executive will apply to all Covered Executives in the same executive position category for purposes of this Policy. Any modifications or the termination of this Policy will not affect the rights of Covered Executives whose termination date preceded the modification or termination. The Compensation Committee will have discretion to construe and interpret this Policy and its decisions will be final and binding on the Company, the Covered Executive and all other interested persons.
Miscellaneous
All payments to a Covered Executive will be reduced by any required withholdings of taxes. The Covered Executive's rights and obligations under this Policy may not be assigned or transferred.
Definitions
Cause
means (i) Covered Executive is convicted of or pleads guilty (or nolo contendere) to: (x) a felony, or (y) a crime involving moral turpitude; (ii) the Company determines that Covered Executive knowingly violated any of the Company's policies, rules or guidelines; or (iii) the Company determines that Covered Executive willfully engaged in conduct, or willfully failed to perform assigned duties, the result of which exposes the Company to serious actual or potential injury (financial or otherwise).
Change in Control
will mean the occurrence of any of the following on or after the Effective Date of this Policy:
9
(i) an acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the Voting Securities) by any Person (as the term person is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), immediately after which such Person has Beneficial Ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the then outstanding common stock of the Company (Shares) or the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities;
provided, however,
in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred pursuant to this subsection (a), Shares or Voting Securities which are acquired in a Non-Control Acquisition (as hereinafter defined) will not constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in Control. A Non-Control Acquisition will mean an acquisition by (a) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (1) the Company or (2) any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its voting power or its voting equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company (for purposes of this definition, a Related Entity), (b) the Company or any Related Entity, or (c) any Person in connection with a Non-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined);
(ii)    the individuals who, as of the Effective Date of this Policy, are members of the Board (the Incumbent Board), cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board or, following a Merger Event which results in a Parent Corporation, the board of directors of the ultimate Parent Corporation (as defined in Paragraph iii (1) (a) below);
provided, however,
that if the election, or nomination for election by the Company's common stockholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such new director will, for purposes of this Policy, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
provided further, however,
that no individual will be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office as a result of an actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board (a Proxy Contest) including by reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle a Proxy Contest; or
(iii)    the consummation of:
(1) a merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the Company or in which securities of the Company are issued (a Merger Event), unless such Merger Event is a Non-Control Transaction. A Non-Control Transaction will mean a Merger Event where:
(a)
the stockholders of the Company immediately before such Merger Event own directly or indirectly immediately following such Merger Event at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of (x) the corporation resulting from such Merger Event (the Surviving Corporation) if fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Surviving Corporation is not Beneficially Owned, directly or indirectly by another Person (a Parent Corporation), or (y) if there are one or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent Corporation; and,
(b)
the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing for such Merger Event constitute at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of (x) the Surviving Corporation, if there
10
is no Parent Corporation, or (y) if there are one or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent Corporation; and
(c)
no Person other than (1) the Company, (2) any Related Entity, (3) any employee benefit plan (or any trust forming a part thereof) that, immediately prior to such Merger Event was maintained by the Company or any Related Entity, or (4) any Person who, immediately prior to such Merger Event had Beneficial Ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities or Shares, has Beneficial Ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities or common stock of (x) the Surviving Corporation if there is no Parent Corporation, or (y) if there are one or more Parent Corporations, the ultimate Parent Corporation.
(2)     a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or
(3)    the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any Person (other than a transfer to a Related Entity or under conditions that would constitute a Non-Control Transaction with the disposition of assets being regarded as a Merger Event for this purpose or the distribution to the Company's stockholders of the stock of a Related Entity or any other assets).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control will not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the Subject Person) acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding Shares or Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Shares or Voting Securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of Shares or Voting Securities then outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Shares or Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Shares or Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Shares or Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change of Control will occur.
In addition, a Change in Control will not be deemed to occur unless the event(s) that causes such Change in Control also constitutes a change in control event, as such term is defined in Section 409A.
Disability
means Covered Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental impairment that causes the Covered Executive to be absent from Covered Executive's full-time duties for six consecutive months.
Effective Date
means February 9, 2010.
Good Reason
means a reduction in Covered Executive's base salary, bonus opportunity, or title and applies only during the one-year period following a Change in Control.
Without Cause
means a termination of Covered Executive's employment by the Company other than (i) for Cause or (ii) because of the Covered Executive's Disability or death.

(the Company) and Robert Boucher, Employee No. 719040025 (Executive) enter into this Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Arbitration Agreement (Agreement), effective August 24, 2012 (the Effective Date). The Company and Executive will be referred to as the Parties in this Agreement. The Parties agree as follows:
1.    
Certain Definitions and Understandings
. The Parties expect that some or all of the obligations the Company will assume to Executive under this Agreement will be fulfilled through its subsidiary, related, or successor companies (Affiliates). Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that the discharge of any obligation of the Company under this Agreement by one or more of its Affiliates discharges the Companys obligation in that regard. Moreover, the obligations Executive will assume under this Agreement will be owed to the Company and its Affiliates (collectively referred to as the Company for the remainder of this Agreement).
2.    
General Duties.
Executive acknowledges that he will be entrusted with significant responsibility for managing aspects of the Companys business. Executive also acknowledges that, due to the confidential nature of his job responsibilities, he will be entrusted with significant responsibility for managing, using and otherwise handling Confidential Information (as defined below) belonging to the Company. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that he owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty, fidelity and allegiance to act at all times in the best interests of the Company and to refrain from doing or saying anything to a third party or subordinate that injures the Company.
3.    
Consideration Executive Will Receive Under This Agreement
. The Parties recognize that in order for Executive to perform his duties, Executive needs to manage, use or otherwise handle Confidential Information (as defined below) belonging to the Company. Thus, the Company agrees to provide Executive with, and access to, Confidential Information necessary to perform his duties. Executive agrees that, in exchange for the Company providing him with Confidential Information, his eligibility to participate in the Companys Executive Separation Policy or any successor or similar policy maintained by the Company for the benefit of similarly situated employees, and the Companys agreement to employ Executive on an at-will basis, Executive will make the promises set forth in the following sections of this Agreement.

4.1    For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information is not limited to information that would qualify as a Trade Secret and includes, but is not limited to: customer lists and agreements; customer service information; names of customer contacts and the identities of their decision-makers; routes and/or territories; information provided to the Company by any actual or potential customer, government agency or other third party;
1
the Companys internal personnel and financial information; information about vendors that is not generally known to the public; purchasing and internal cost information; information about the profitability of particular operations; internal service and operational manuals and procedures; the manner and methods of conducting the Companys business; marketing plans, development plans, price data, cost data, price and fee amounts, pricing and billing policies, quoting procedures, marketing techniques, forecasts and forecast assumptions and volumes; future plans and potential acquisition, divestiture and other development strategies; non-public information about the Companys landfill development plans, landfill capacity, special projects, and the status of any permitting process; the status of any governmental investigation, charge, or lawsuit and the position of the Company regarding the value of such matter; non-public information regarding the Companys compliance with federal, state or local laws; information that gives the Company some competitive business advantage, or the opportunity of obtaining such an advantage, or the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of the Company; and/or information that is not generally known outside the Company.
4.2    As a consequence of Executives acquisition of Confidential Information, Executive agrees that it is reasonable and necessary that he make the following covenants:
(a)    At no time while Executive is employed or at any time after his employment ends will Executive disclose Confidential Information to any person or entity either inside or outside of the Company other than as necessary in carrying out his duties and responsibilities, nor will Executive use, copy, or transfer Confidential Information other than as necessary in carrying out his duties and responsibilities, without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent. In the event a court concludes that the temporal restrictions in this Section 4.2(a) are unreasonable, Executives obligations under this Section 4.2(a) will end five (5) years after his employment ends. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from providing information to any administrative or governmental agency, or from testifying under the power of a subpoena issued from a court of competent jurisdiction.
(b)    During his employment, Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company all information, ideas, concepts, improvements, discoveries and inventions (Inventions), which he conceives, develops, creates, or acquires, either individually or jointly with others, and which relate to the business, products, or services of the Company, irrespective of whether such Inventions were conceived, developed, discovered, or acquired by Executive on the job, at home, or elsewhere. Executive further agrees that all right, title and interest (including copyrights) in and to any Inventions shall be the property of the Company.
(c)    When Executives employment with the Company ends, Executive will immediately deliver to the Company (or its designee) anything containing Confidential Information including, but not limited to, reports, studies, materials, records, documents, books, files, videotapes, tape recordings, computers, computer disks, flash/thumb drives, CDs, DVDs, PDAs, Blackberry devices, mobile telephones, and/or other
2
devices used to store electronic data, including any copies thereof, whether made by Executive or which came into his possession prior to or during his employment concerning the business or affairs of the Company.

(b)    During his employment, Executive will have detailed knowledge of, and active participation in, many issues affecting the Companys operations across the nation. Much of the Confidential Information Executive will receive will not be limited to a particular geographic area.

In the event a court concludes that twenty-four (24) months is an
4
unreasonable period of time, Executives obligations under this Section 5.3 will end eighteen (18) months after his employment ends.
(b)    Executive will not Contact any customers, potential customers, or acquisition prospects of the Company that Executive generated, serviced, managed, contacted, or maintained at any time during the last twenty-four (24) months of his employment on behalf of any Principal Competitor, or any Competitor, that provides Non-hazardous Solid Waste Management services within forty (40) miles of any Facility.
(c)    Executive will not, either directly or indirectly, raid, Solicit, attempt to Solicit, or induce, any employee of, consultant to, or independent contractor of, the Company to terminate his or her relationship with the Company in order to become an employee of, consultant to, independent contractor of, or act in any other way on behalf of, any other person or entity.
5.4    
Judicial Modification
. If the applicable temporal or geographic limitations agreed to by the Parties in this Section 5 are found by a court to be overbroad, the Parties expressly authorize the judge before whom any dispute is brought to impose the broadest temporal and geographic limitations permissible under the law.
6.    
Executives Obligation to Avoid Conflicts of Interest
. Executive agrees to abide by the Companys Conflicts of Interests policy, which includes not becoming involved, directly or indirectly, in a situation that a reasonable person would recognize to be an actual conflict of interest with the Company. If Executive discovers, or is informed by the Company that he has become involved in a situation that is an actual or likely conflict of interest with the Company, Executive will take immediate actions to eliminate the conflict. The Companys determination as to whether or not a conflict of interest exists will be conclusive.
7.    
Miscellaneous
.
7.1    
Waiver of Breach
. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will neither operate nor be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.
7.2    
Assignment
. The Company may assign this Agreement upon written notice to Executive. However, Executive agrees that his rights and obligations under this Agreement are personal to him and may not be assigned without the express written consent of the Company.
7.3    
Entire Agreement, No Oral Amendments
. This Agreement replaces and merges all previous agreements and discussions relating to any rights and obligations between Executive and the Company with respect to the subjects addressed in this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified except by a written agreement signed by a representative of the Company who is expressly authorized by the Companys Board of
5
Directors to execute such a modification or agreement.
7.4    
Enforceability
. If a court or arbitrator authorized by this Agreement to resolve disputes between the Parties determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be struck from the Agreement without affecting any other provision of this Agreement. All remaining provisions of this Agreement that were not struck will be enforced according to their terms.
7.5    
Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue.
This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona. Additionally, the Parties agree that the courts situated in Maricopa County, Arizona will have personal jurisdiction over them to hear all disputes arising under, or related to, this Agreement and that venue will be proper only in Maricopa County, Arizona.
7.6
    
Injunctive Relief
. The Company and Executive agree that a breach of any term of this Agreement by Executive would cause irreparable harm to the Company and that, in the event of such breach, the Company will have, in addition to any and all remedies of law, the right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or redress the violation of Executives obligations under this Agreement. Additionally, to provide the Company with the protections it has bargained for in this Agreement, any period of time in which Executive has been in breach will extend, by that amount of time, the time for which Executive should be precluded from further breaching the promises made in the Agreement.
7.7    
Attorneys Fees
. The Company and Executive agree that, if Executive is found to have breached any term under Sections 2, 4, 5, or 6 of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to recover the attorneys fees and costs it incurred in enforcing this Agreement.
7.8    
Arbitration
. With the sole exception of any breach by Executive of the obligations he assumed under Sections 2, 4, 5, and 6 of this Agreement (the breach of which permits the Company to obtain judicial relief due to the exigent circumstances presented by such a breach), all other alleged breaches of this Agreement, or any other dispute between the Parties arising out of or in connection with Executives employment with the Company will be settled by binding arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement to arbitrate applies to any claim for relief of any nature, including, but not limited to, claims of wrongful discharge under statutory law and common law; employment discrimination based on federal, state or local statute, ordinance, or governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act; claims of retaliatory discharge or other acts of retaliation; compensation disputes; tortious conduct; allegedly contractual violations; ERISA violations; and other statutory and common law claims and disputes, regardless of whether the statute was enacted or whether the common
6
law doctrine was recognized at the time this Agreement was signed.
The Parties understand that they are agreeing to substitute one legitimate dispute resolution forum (arbitration) for another (litigation) because of the mutual advantages this forum offers, and are waiving their right to have their disputes (except as to breaches of Sections 2, 4, 5, and 6 of this Agreement) resolved in court. This substitution involves no surrender, by either party, of any substantive statutory or common law benefit, protection, or defense.
The arbitration proceeding will be conducted in Maricopa County, Arizona in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (National Rules) of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in effect at the time a demand for arbitration is made. One arbitrator shall be used and he or she shall be chosen by mutual agreement of the Parties. If the Parties cannot agree on the selection of an arbitrator after thirty (30) days, an arbitrator shall be chosen by the AAA pursuant to its National Rules. The arbitrator shall coordinate and, as appropriate, limit all pre-arbitration discovery. However, the Parties shall have the right to obtain discovery through appropriate document requests, information requests, and depositions. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision and award, stating the reasons for the award. The decision and award shall be exclusive, final, and binding on the Parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns.
The Company will pay all costs and expenses of the arbitration, except for the filing fees and costs that would have been required had the proceeding been initiated and maintained in the Maricopa County Superior Court, which fees and costs Executive will pay. Each Party will pay their own attorneys fees and expenses throughout the arbitration proceeding. However, the arbitrator may award the successful Party its attorneys fees and expenses at the conclusion of the arbitration and any other relief provided by law.
