Burnham, 56, has decided to step down as chief executive officer of the company. Burnham will continue to serve on the board as non-executive chairman. "Dan Burnham has brought a clear vision, strong leadership and critical change to Raytheon," said Warren B. Rudman, lead director of the Raytheon Board of Directors and former U.S. Senator. "He faced challenging issues with courage and integrity and steps down as CEO with Raytheon well positioned for future success. The board reluctantly accepted Dan's decision and is grateful to him for his exemplary service. We are pleased that he has agreed to remain as non-executive chairman of the board to ensure a smooth transition," Rudman added. The Board of Directors today named William H. Swanson, 54, currently president of Raytheon, to succeed Burnham as CEO. Swanson will assume his new responsibilities as president and chief executive officer effective July 1, 2003. "Bill Swanson brings tremendous experience in the defense industry and a proven record of leadership and performance to his new responsibilities," Rudman said. "We are delighted to have a leader with Bill's experience and capability in the company to succeed Dan as CEO," he added. In reflecting on his decision to step down as CEO, Burnham said: "Raytheon is performing well. I am leaving a very good company in great hands. I have had a terrific business career for more than 35 years, and I am especially proud of the last five years here at Raytheon. It was a difficult decision, but I am ready to begin a new, more personal phase in my life." Burnham said he was proud of the company's accomplishments over the last five years and that Bill Swanson is the right leader to become Raytheon's next CEO. "Bill is a seasoned and gifted executive; there is no one better in the defense industry. He has the experience, the instincts and the track record to lead Raytheon in this exciting time in our history," Burnham said.

I look forward to continuing to work side-by-side with our employees to help the company achieve even greater customer success. I couldn't be more excited about the future of Raytheon," Swanson said.
