1 EXHIBIT 99.1 RAYTHEON Media Relations News release Media Contact: Investor Relations Contact: James Fetig Tim Oliver 781-860-2386 781-860-2167 Raytheon Reports Second Quarter 2003 EPS of $0.45 from Continuing Operations Government and defense sales up 7 percent; 4 segments reported double digit sales growth First half government and defense bookings exceed comparable period by $3.2 billion Free cash flow from continuing operations of $649 million EPS of $0.24 including impact of discontinued operations LEXINGTON, Mass., (July 24, 2003) - Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported second quarter 2003 income from continuing operations of $186 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $223 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the second quarter 2002. Income from continuing operations includes a net gain of $15 million or $0.03 per share primarily resulting from the sale of an investment. Non-cash pension expense (FAS/CAS pension adjustment) accounted for a $0.14 decrease in earnings per diluted share on a year-over-year basis. Second quarter 2003 net income was $100 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $136 million or $0.33 per diluted share in 2002. Net income for the second quarter of 2003 includes an $86 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations, or $0.21 per diluted share. Net sales for the second quarter 2003 were $4.4 billion, up from $4.1 billion in the comparable period in 2002. The government and defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 7 percent to $3.8 billion from $3.5 billion in the comparable quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter 2003 was $533 million, net of $116 million consumed by discontinued operations. Free cash flow for the comparable quarter last year was $162 million. Free cash flow represents a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Attachment F is a table reconciling this measure to operating cash flow, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. "We are seeing the benefits of aligning our Strategic Business Areas with our customer's priorities and concentrating on customer-focused metrics," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon CEO and president. "As a result, government and defense bookings in the first half of this year exceeded the first half of last year by $3.2 billion." Swanson also stated, "We are pleased that Raytheon Aircraft Company continues to execute on its balanced operating plan in the face of tough market conditions." In the first half of the year, the Missile Defense Strategic Business Area (SBA) won two strategically important missile defense contracts, Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) and Sea-based TEST X-Band Radar. The Precision Engagement SBA won Miniature Air-Launched Decoy and U.K. Precision Guided Bomb (Paveway IV) contracts and the Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance SBA has been awarded approximately $1 billion of classified business. In the government and defense businesses, strong second quarter bookings of $3.8 billion lifted government and defense backlog to $22.4 billion, up from $19.8 billion in the 2002 comparable period.
2 Aircraft backlog at the end of the second quarter was $2.2 billion down from $4.7 billion a year ago. During the quarter, aircraft backlog was impacted by two events. First, the consolidation of Flight Options LLC reduced reported backlog by $834 million. Second, NetJets canceled its order for 50 Hawker Horizon aircraft resulting in an $895 million backlog reduction. The first scheduled delivery of a Hawker Horizon to NetJets was to be mid-year 2005. The Company believes that this cancellation will not materially impact financial results in 2003 or 2004. OUTLOOK The Company is increasing its guidance for sales growth. For 2003, consolidated sales growth is expected to be 9 to 10 percent versus the prior period, up from earlier guidance of 6 to 7 percent. Government and defense sales are expected to increase 8.5 to 9 percent versus 2002 and earlier guidance of 6 to 7 percent. As a result of the consolidation of Flight Options LLC, we expect Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC)2003 sales to increase by approximately $300 million to $350 million. The Company has not changed its guidance for 2003 earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.70-$1.80 per diluted share. Increased profit from higher forecasted government and defense sales is expected to be offset by performance issues on several Network Centric Systems (NCS) programs. The Company is increasing its guidance on free cash flow from continuing operations by $100 million to a range of $1,050 million to $1,150 million. Cash outflow from discontinued operations is expected to increase by approximately $100 million to a range of $425 million to $475 million. Total free cash flow from operations is expected to be between $575 million to $725 million. SEGMENT RESULTS Integrated Defense Systems Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) second quarter 2003 net sales were $701 million, up 17 percent compared to $599 million in the second quarter 2002 due primarily to continued growth in DD(X), the Navy's future destroyer program, as well as strong missile defense sales. IDS generated $80 million of operating income compared to $72 million in the 2002 comparable quarter. During the quarter, IDS booked two important missile defense contracts. IDS received a sole-source contract to engineer, construct, integrate and test a forward-deployable Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) radar valued at approximately $350 million and the Sea-based Test-XBR contract valued at approximately $419 million to fabricate, assemble and test a radar mounted on an ocean-going platform.
3 Intelligence and Information Systems Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) second quarter 2003 net sales were $525 million, up 15 percent compared to $457 million in the second quarter 2002 due primarily to strong growth in new classified programs as well as growth in the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program. IIS earned $46 million of operating income compared to $41 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Missile Systems Missile Systems (MS) second quarter 2003 net sales were $833 million, up 14 percent compared to $729 million in the second quarter 2002 driven by work on the Tomahawk remanufacturing program and an increase in production for Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9x), Tactical Tomahawk and Enhanced Sea Sparrow Missile. MS generated $104 million of operating income compared to $93 million in the comparable quarter. During the quarter, MS was selected by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence to supply Paveway IV to meet the Royal Air Force's requirement for a new Precision Guided Bomb (PGB), an award estimated at approximately $175 million. In addition, MS was selected by the U.S. Air Force for an $88 million contract to develop and demonstrate a Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) and received a $96 million contract for the continued production of the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Network Centric Systems Network Centric Systems (NCS) second quarter 2003 net sales were $716 million, down 6 percent compared to $760 million in the second quarter 2002. NCS earned $20 million in operating income compared to $58 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. The decline in operating income is due to performance issues on several programs. During the quarter, NCS was awarded a contract valued at approximately $90 million for the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) program to produce 13 self-defense systems. Subsequent to the quarter, NCS was selected by the U.S. Army to enter into negotiations on a contract to serve as Ground Sensor Integrator (GSI) for Future Combat Systems (FCS). In addition, NCS was selected to enter into a contract to develop the Battle Command Mission Execution (BCME) component for FCS. Space and Airborne Systems Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) second quarter 2003 net sales were $886 million, up 11 percent compared to $798 million in the second quarter 2002, due primarily to stronger classified sales. SAS generated $127 million of operating income compared to $108 million in the comparable quarter. During the quarter, SAS was awarded a $242 million contract with the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense to produce the Advanced Self-Protection Integrated Suite (ASPIS II) for its F-16 aircraft fleet, a $110 million contract by the U.S. Army's Special Operations Command for the design and delivery of electro-optic sensor systems for use on board helicopters during day or night operations, and a $63 million contract to continue the modernization of the radar on the U.S. Air Force's B-2 "Spirit" Bomber. Technical Services Technical Services (TS) second quarter 2003 net sales were $465 million, down 8 percent from $505 million in the second quarter 2002, due primarily to the loss of the Kwajalein missile range contract in 2002. TS generated $34 million of operating income compared to $5 million in the comparable quarter last year. Prior period results included a $28 million write-down.
4 During the quarter, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency selected TS to perform on three Cooperative Threat Reduction Integrating Contract (CTRIC) task orders. The combined potential value of the contracts, including all options, is approximately $300 million, subject to final negotiations. Aircraft Raytheon Aircraft Company(RAC) second quarter 2003 net sales were $627 million, up from $526 million in the second quarter 2002. RAC's operating income in the quarter was $7 million, compared to $11 million in the comparable quarter in 2002. The net impact of Flight Options' consolidation this quarter is a $54 million increase in sales and no impact on operating income. RAC delivered 67 commercial aircraft in the second quarter of 2003, compared to 60 in the same quarter last year. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The total pretax loss from discontinued operations for the quarter was $133 million. During the quarter, the Company recorded a $106 million pretax charge associated with increased costs for two construction projects and recorded a $13 million pretax charge for period and other costs associated with its former engineering and construction businesses. Also, the Company recorded a $14 million pretax charge related to cost growth on the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) program and further write-down of BBJ inventory retained after the disposition of its former Aircraft Integration Systems business. Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN), with 2002 sales of $16.8 billion, is an industry leader in defense, government and commercial electronics, space, information technology, technical services, and business and special mission aircraft. With headquarters in Lexington, Mass., Raytheon employs more than 76,000 people worldwide.
