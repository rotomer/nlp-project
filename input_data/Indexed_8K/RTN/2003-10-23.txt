FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Raytheon Reports Third Quarter 2003 EPS of $0.05 from Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
 
 
LEXINGTONMass., (October 23, 2003)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported third quarter 2003 income from continuing operations of $21 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to $228 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the third quarter 2002. The reduction in earnings primarily reflects performance issues in the Network Centric Systems (NCS) business including $187 million or $0.31 per diluted share primarily related to cost growth on risk programs identified last quarter. The Company also recorded charges of $39 million or $0.06 per diluted share at the Technical Services (TS) business.
,
 
At NCS, continued technical challenges, reductions and delays in scheduled deliveries, negative developments on contract negotiations, and performance deterioration all contributed to the cost growth. At TS, the charge was due to a customer-driven change in scope on a long-term contract and a change in the expectation for the recoverability of certain costs.
 
Non-cash pension expense (FAS/CAS pension adjustment) accounted for $0.14 of the decrease in earnings per diluted share on a year-over-year basis.
 
Third quarter 2003 net loss was $35 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared to net income of $147 million or $0.36 per diluted share in 2002. Net loss for the third quarter of 2003 includes a $56 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.13 per diluted share versus an $81
 
million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.20 per diluted share in 2002. The charges in the quarter would cause a technical default relative to the interest coverage ratio in the Company's senior credit facilities. The Company will request, and expects to receive, as it has in the past, an amendment to remain in compliance.
 
Net sales for the third quarter 2003 were $4.4 billion, up from $4.1 billion in the comparable period in 2002. The third quarter 2003 includes $141 million of sales resulting from the previously announced consolidation of Flight Options. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 3 percent to $3.7 billion from $3.6 billion in the comparable quarter, including a $178 million negative impact to sales resulting from the NCS charges. Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS), Missile Systems (MS), and Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) all generated double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
 
Free cash flow for the third quarter 2003 was $471 million, net of $64 million consumed by discontinued operations. Free cash flow for the comparable quarter last year was $80 million. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter was $535 million versus $402 million for the comparable period in 2002. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Attachment G contains a table reconciling this measure to operating cash flow, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
 
"We are disappointed that an otherwise strong quarter has been diminished by the shortfalls at Network Centric Systems and Technical Services," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon chief executive officer and president. "We have taken and will continue to take appropriate actions to address these performance issues. Going forward, we expect that these businesses will be more predictable performers." Swanson also stated, "IDS, IIS, MS and SAS all delivered strong results in the quarter and continued their exceptional performance in 2003."
 
The Government and Defense businesses recorded strong third quarter bookings of over $4 billion and year-to-date bookings of nearly $13 billion versus the comparable period bookings of $10.5 billion last year. RAC posted third quarter bookings of approximately $550 million and year-to-date bookings of $1.4 billion versus $2.3 billion in the 2002 comparable period. The
 
higher 2002 bookings were due primarily to an approximately $850 million Flight Options order in the first quarter.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The Company expects fourth quarter 2003 sales to be $4.9 to $5.0 billion and income from continuing operations to be $0.52 to $0.54 per diluted share. Stronger performance in a number of the defense businesses will be offset by lower sales and profit at NCS. The Company also expects free cash flow from continuing operations to be $500 to $550 million and total free cash flow to be $450 to $500 million for the fourth quarter.
 
For the full year, the Company expects sales to be $17.9 to $18.0 billion and income from continuing operations to be $1.29 to $1.31 per diluted share. The Company also expects free cash flow from continuing operations to be approximately $1.2 billion and total free cash flow to be $625 to $675 million for the year.
 
The Company expects total 2004 sales growth to be 8 to 10 percent versus prior guidance of 6 to 8 percent. Government and Defense sales growth in 2004 is expected to be 8 to 10 percent. RAC sales growth is expected to be 10 to 12 percent due to the full year impact of the consolidation of Flight Options.
 
Income from continuing operations is expected to be $1.50 to $1.60 per diluted share in 2004 versus previous guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share. The new income guidance reflects deterioration in the forecasted sales mix, volume and operating margin rate at NCS, and assumes no change in the pension expense assumption. As previously disclosed, a decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase our expected 2004 pension expense.
 
The Company continues to expect that 2004 free cash flow will be about $1.0 billion.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) third quarter 2003 net sales were $718 million, up 33 percent compared to $541 million in the third quarter 2002 due primarily to continued growth in DD(X), the Navy's future destroyer program, strong missile defense sales, and increased Patriot
 
engineering support for Operation Iraqi Freedom. IDS generated $82 million of operating income compared to $70 million in the 2002 comparable quarter.
 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, IDS responded to a sole source solicitation released by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) for the design, production, integration, and testing of Cobra Judy Replacement Mission Equipment (CJRME).
 
Intelligence and Information Systems
 
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) third quarter 2003 net sales were $533 million, up 10 percent compared to $485 million in the third quarter 2002 due primarily to strong growth in new classified programs. IIS earned $54 million of operating income compared to $46 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
During the quarter, IIS was awarded a $101 million contract to provide information technology operations and maintain NASA's Earth Observing System.
 
Missile Systems
 
Missile Systems (MS) third quarter 2003 net sales were $905 million, up 14 percent compared to $792 million in the third quarter 2002 driven by work on the Tomahawk remanufacturing program and an increase in production for Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Enhanced Sea Sparrow Missile, Paveway, Standard Missile-3, and Tactical Tomahawk. MS generated $111 million of operating income compared to $94 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
During the quarter, MS was awarded an $880 million not-to-exceed letter contract from the U.S. Navy to continue development of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3); $330 million of this award was included in third quarter bookings. In addition, MS definitized its contract for the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) in the amount of $159 million.
 
Network Centric Systems
 
Network Centric Systems (NCS) third quarter 2003 net sales were $556 million, down 27 percent compared to $759 million in the third quarter 2002. NCS recorded an operating loss of $138 million compared to $63 million in income in the comparable quarter a year ago. The decline in operating income reflects charges of $187 million including approximately $147 million associated with the ten previously identified programs at risk, as well as $40 million resulting from negative developments in other parts of the NCS business.
 
Space and Airborne Systems
 
Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) third quarter 2003 net sales were $930 million, up 16 percent compared to $803 million in the third quarter 2002, due to stronger classified sales and new and follow-on Air Force awards. SAS generated $131 million of operating income compared to $109 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
During the third quarter SAS received over $300 million in classified awards and a $242 million contract to equip the Greek Air Force F-16 aircraft fleet with its ASPIS II electronic warfare system.
 
Technical Services
 
Technical Services (TS) third quarter 2003 net sales were $447 million, down 20 percent from $556 million in the third quarter 2002, due primarily to the loss of the Kwajalein missile range contract in 2002. TS reported an operating loss of $2 million compared to operating income of $37 million in the comparable quarter last year. The reduction in operating income reflects write-offs of approximately $39 million primarily related to a change in scope on a long-term contract and a provision for the recoverability of certain costs.
 
Aircraft
 
Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) third quarter 2003 net sales were $637 million, up from $451 million in the third quarter 2002. RAC recorded an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $11 million in the comparable quarter in 2002. The net impact of Flight Options' consolidation this quarter was a $141 million increase in sales and $2 million decrease in operating income.
 
RAC delivered 61 commercial aircraft in the third quarter of 2003, compared to 43 in the same quarter last year.
 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
The total after-tax loss from discontinued operations for the quarter was $56 million. During the quarter, the Company recorded a $36 million after-tax charge associated with increased costs for close-out of supplier contracts and estimates of cost to complete punch list activities for two power plant construction projects. The Company also recorded a $15 million after-tax charge for period and other costs associated with its former engineering and construction businesses, including legal expense, increased costs on abandoned leases and settlement of a warranty obligation. Also, the Company recorded a $5 million after-tax charge related to its former Aircraft Integration Systems business.
 
Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN), with 2002 sales of $16.8 billion, is an industry leader in defense, government and commercial electronics, space, information technology, technical services, and business and special mission aircraft. With headquarters in Lexington, Mass., Raytheon employs more than 76,000 people worldwide.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure
 
Operating cash flow
 
Free cash flow represents a non-GAAP financial measure defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. The Company's management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the operating performance of its business and as a component for determining incentive-based compensation. In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow is an important measure of performance used by some investors, equity analysts and others to make informed investment decisions. The definitions used here may differ from those used by other companies.
