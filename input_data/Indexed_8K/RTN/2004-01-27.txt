FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Raytheon Reports Fourth Quarter 2003 EPS of $0.52 from Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (Jan. 27, 2004)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported fourth quarter 2003 income from continuing operations of $217 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared to $155 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2002. Income from continuing operations includes a pre-tax charge of $77 million from the early redemption of debt and a $55 million gain from the sale of its remaining investments in the Company's former aviation support business, both of which were previously announced. Non-cash pension expense (FAS/CAS pension adjustment) negatively impacted the quarter by $0.14 per diluted share on a year-over-year basis.
,
 
Fourth quarter 2003 net income was $205 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $68 million or $0.17 per diluted share in 2002. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 includes a $12 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.03 per diluted share versus a $223 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.54 per diluted share in 2002.
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter 2003 were $5.1 billion, up from $4.7 billion in the comparable period in 2002. The fourth quarter 2003 includes $177 million of sales resulting from the previously announced consolidation of Flight Options LLC. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 5 percent to $4.2 billion from $4.0 billion in the comparable quarter. Integrated Defense Systems and Missile Systems generated double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $906 million versus $1,017 million for the comparable period in 2002. Free cash flow, including discontinued operations, for the fourth quarter 2003 was $858 million versus $626 million in 2002. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Attachment F contains a table reconciling this measure to operating cash flow, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
 
"All of the businesses met or exceeded our expectations in the quarter and contributed to our strong performance," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon CEO and president. "We remain focused on delivering results that predictably meet our commitments."
 
Full Year Financial Results
 
For the full year the Company reported income from continuing operations of $535 million or $1.29 per diluted share compared to $755 million or $1.85 per diluted share in 2002. Income from continuing operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by performance issues in the third quarter at Network Centric Systems ($187 million or $0.32 per diluted share) related to cost growth on risk programs identified earlier in the year and increased non-cash pension expense of $319 million or $0.54 per diluted share.
 
Including the impact of discontinued operations, the Company reported 2003 net income of $0.88 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.57 per diluted share in 2002.
 
Total 2003 sales for the Company were $18.1 billion compared to $16.8 billion for 2002, an increase of 8 percent. The full year results include $384 million of sales resulting from the previously announced consolidation of Flight Options. Government and Defense sales for the year (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 7 percent to $15.5 billion from $14.5 billion in 2002.
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations was $1.6 billion in both 2003 and 2002. Free cash flow, including discontinued operations, for the full year 2003 was $1.0 billion, versus $443 million in 2002.
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
The Government and Defense businesses recorded strong fourth quarter bookings of $7.1 billion and bookings for the full year 2003 of $20 billion, an increase of nearly 35 percent compared to bookings of $14.9 billion in 2002. Government and Defense backlog reached a record $25 billion, an increase of $4 billion over year end 2002.
 
RAC's fourth quarter bookings were $1.1 billion. Full year 2003 bookings were $2.2 billion versus $2.9 billion for 2002. During the quarter, NetJets Inc. placed a $360 million order for 50 new Hawker 400XP light jets and 8 new Hawker 800XP mid-size jets.
 
Revised Outlook
 
Earnings per share in 2004 from continuing operations are expected to be $1.25 to $1.35. This range has been adjusted from prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.60 to reflect a $0.25 per share increase in pension expense, resulting primarily from a change in the discount rate assumption from 7 percent to 6.25 percent.
 
The Company expects net sales for 2004 of $19.5 billion to $20 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2004.
 
"2003 was a record year for bookings and backlog, with exceptional cash flow performance," Swanson said. "This performance is a direct result of our customer focus and will provide momentum for a solid 2004."
 
Further supporting information including reporting segment detail, quarterly detail, and cash flow detail have been provided in charts that will be posted to the Company's website and will be discussed during the conference call this morning.
 
Segment Results
 
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) fourth quarter 2003 net sales were $791 million, up 25 percent compared to $635 million in the fourth quarter 2002, due primarily to continued growth in DD(X), the Navy's future destroyer program, strong missile defense sales, and increased Patriot engineering support for Operation Iraqi Freedom. IDS generated $95 million of fourth quarter 2003 operating income compared to $76 million in the 2002 comparable quarter.
 
As previously announced, the U.S. Navy awarded IDS a $1 billion letter contract for the design, production, integration, and testing of Cobra Judy Replacement Mission Equipment (CJRME). Also in the quarter, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command awarded IDS JLENS Spiral 2 Development, a netted sensor system for cruise missile defense, on which work has begun.
 
Intelligence and Information Systems
 
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) fourth quarter 2003 net sales were $525 million compared to $528 million in the fourth quarter 2002. While full-year 2003 revenue increased by 8 percent, fourth quarter results were impacted by the acceleration of work into earlier quarters at the request of a classified customer. IIS earned $53 million of operating income compared to $56 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
During the quarter, IIS was awarded a $157 million U.S. Air Force contract to upgrade an intelligence system called the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). The initial value of the contract, including options, is $157 million. With added U.S. Navy options, the contract value is expected to be nearly $360 million.
 
Missile Systems
 
Missile Systems (MS) fourth quarter 2003 net sales were $943 million, up 19 percent compared to $790 million in the fourth quarter 2002, driven by increased volume on the Tomahawk remanufacturing, Phalanx, Standard Missile-3, and Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle programs. MS generated $108 million of operating income compared to $92 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
In December, the Missile Defense Agency awarded the Kinetic Energy Interceptor system program to the Northrop Grumman - Raytheon team. This program has a potential value of over $2 billion for Raytheon during the next 8 years and will be added to bookings in the first quarter 2004.
 
Also during the quarter, MS was also awarded a $111 million contract to overhaul 42 Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems, a $264 million production contract for Standard Missile-2, and a $140 million production contract for Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW).
 
Network Centric Systems
 
Network Centric Systems (NCS) fourth quarter 2003 net sales were $766 million, down 7 percent compared to $824 million in the fourth quarter 2002, as expected. This decline is attributable to reduced sales in the air traffic management and communications product lines. NCS recorded an operating profit of $75 million compared to $84 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
The 10 risk programs that led to the significant profit adjustment in the third quarter of 2003 were on plan.
 
NCS booked $268M in the quarter for its role as the Ground System Integrator on the Future Combat System.
 
Space and Airborne Systems
 
Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) fourth quarter 2003 net sales were $967 million, up 3 percent compared to $935 million in the fourth quarter 2002, due to stronger classified sales and Air Force programs including the Multi-platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MPRTIP) and B-2. SAS generated $130 million of operating income compared to $126 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
During the quarter, SAS was awarded a $298 million contract from the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) for full-rate production of the AN/ASQ-228 Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) pod for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps' F/A-18 fleet. SAS also received a major follow-on classified award.
 
Technical Services
 
Technical Services (TS) fourth quarter 2003 net sales were $560 million, up 3 percent from $544 million in the fourth quarter 2002. TS reported an operating profit of $39 million in the fourth quarters of both 2003 and 2002.
 
Aircraft
 
Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) fourth quarter 2003 net sales were $717 million, up 9 percent from $660 million in the fourth quarter 2002. RAC recorded operating income of $29 million in the quarter compared to $4 million in the comparable quarter in 2002. Operating income in the fourth quarter 2003 benefited from a favorable $37 million profit adjustment on the JPATS program partially offset by a $17 million charge on the Premier program reflecting cost estimate increases.
 
RAC delivered 100 commercial aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to 94 in the same quarter last year. Beginning this quarter, the RAC results exclude Flight Options LLC and Raytheon Airline Aviation Services (RAAS), which are now included in the "Other" reporting segment. RAAS is a unit formed to manage the Company's commuter and Starship portfolio.
 
During December, RAC received an order from NetJets Inc. for 50 new Hawker 400XP light jets and 8 new Hawker 800XP mid-sized jets. These aircraft will be delivered through 2009 and have an aggregate value of $360 million.
 
The Hawker Horizon program remains on schedule for first delivery in 2004. The flight test fleet of 3 aircraft has now completed over 850 hours of testing with over 50 percent of the flight test conditions completed.
 
Other
 
Net sales for this segment in the fourth quarter 2003 were $230 million compared to $48 million in the fourth quarter 2002. The segment recorded an operating loss of $21 million in the fourth quarter 2003 compared to break-even results a year ago. For the fourth quarter, Flight Options reported break-even operating results. For the quarter, RAAS reported an operating loss of $20 million primarily due to an increase in a loan reserve on one major customer.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
The Company recorded an after-tax loss from discontinued operations for the quarter of $12 million, primarily related to program management and legal costs at its former engineering and construction businesses.
 
Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN), with 2003 sales of $18.1 billion, is an industry leader in defense and government electronics, space, information technology, technical services, and business and special mission aircraft. With headquarters in Waltham, Mass., Raytheon employs 78,000 people worldwide.
