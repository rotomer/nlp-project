FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
Raytheon Reports First Quarter 2004 EPS of $0.24 from Continuing Operations and Increases Full-year Guidance for EPS, Bookings, Sales and Free Cash Flow
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (Apr. 29, 2004)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported first quarter 2004 income from continuing operations of $101 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $111 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the first quarter 2003. Non-cash pension expense (FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment) negatively affected the quarter by $0.15 per diluted share on a year-over-year basis.
,
 
First quarter 2004 net income was $128 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $95 million or $0.23 per diluted share in 2003. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 includes a $14 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.03 per diluted share versus $16 million or $0.04 per diluted share in 2003. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 also includes a $41 million or $0.10 per diluted share cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to the previously announced change in the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans measurement date from Oct. 31 to Dec. 31.
 
Net sales for the first quarter 2004 were $4.7 billion, up 11 percent from $4.2 billion in the comparable period in 2003. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 9 percent to $4.1 billion from $3.8 billion in the comparable quarter. Integrated Defense Systems, Missile Systems, and Space and Airborne Systems generated double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter was an outflow of $295 million versus an outflow of $514 million for the comparable period in 2003. Free cash flow, including discontinued operations, for the first quarter 2004 was an outflow of $286 million versus an outflow of $819 million in 2003. Free cash flow was significantly better than prior guidance due to a successful previously discussed financial system implementation in the Northeast combined with the receipt of a large international collection earlier than expected and continued focus on working capital. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Attachment F contains a table reconciling this measure to operating cash flow, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
 
The Government and Defense businesses recorded first quarter bookings of $7.9 billion compared to bookings of $5.0 billion in the first quarter of 2003. Government and Defense backlog reached a record $28.9 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion over year end 2003.
 
Raytheon Aircraft Company's (RAC) first quarter bookings were $425 million compared to $306 million in 2003.
 
"I am pleased with our strong start in the first quarter," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. "We are encouraged by our record bookings and better than expected free cash flow."
 
Outlook
 
The Company now expects 2004 earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.30-1.40, higher than its prior guidance of $1.25-1.35. The Company also raised its full year guidance for bookings to $23 billion from $22 billion, and for net sales to more than $20 billion from $19.5-20.0 billion. The Company now expects full year free cash flow to exceed $1 billion. A chart summarizing these changes is being posted to the Company's website.
 
Segment Results
 
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) first quarter 2004 net sales were $839 million, up 28 percent compared to $654 million in the first quarter 2003, due primarily to continued growth in DD(X), the Navy's future destroyer program, and strong missile defense sales. IDS generated $94
 
million of first quarter 2004 operating income compared to $74 million in the 2003 comparable quarter.
 
During the quarter, the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command awarded IDS a $122 million contract for the design and development of the Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAMRAAM) system. IDS also received a $148 million contract to provide Patriot engineering services support.

Missile Systems
 
Missile Systems (MS) first quarter 2004 net sales were $965 million, up 13 percent compared to $857 million in the first quarter 2003, driven by increased volume on the Phalanx and Standard Missile-3 programs.

Network Centric Systems
 
Network Centric Systems (NCS) first quarter 2004 net sales were $720 million, down 7 percent compared to $771 million in the first quarter 2003.

Space and Airborne Systems
 
Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) first quarter 2004 net sales were $1,013 million, up 13 percent compared to $894 million in the first quarter 2003, due to stronger classified and international programs including ASTOR.

Technical Services
 
Technical Services (TS) first quarter 2004 net sales were $474 million, down 3 percent from $491 million in the first quarter 2003, due primarily to the completion of a major base and range contract in the first quarter 2003. TS reported an operating profit of $31 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared to $36 million in the comparable quarter a year ago.
 
After the quarter close, the U.S. Navy awarded TS a competitive $237 million contract to provide engineering and technical services for self-defense systems aboard U.S. Navy ships, land-based test sites and ships sold to foreign countries by the United States.
 
Aircraft

RAC delivered 25 commercial aircraft in the first quarter of 2004, compared to 31 in the same quarter last year.
 
Other
 
Net sales for this segment in the first quarter 2004 were $175 million compared to $40 million in the first quarter 2003. The segment recorded an operating loss of $15 million in the first quarter 2004 compared to a loss of $3 million in the comparable quarter in 2003. The consolidation of Flight Options' results in this quarter account for $133 million of the increased sales and $9 million of the increase in loss versus the prior year.
 
Discontinued Operations
 
During the quarter, the Company signed a final settlement agreement on the two Massachusetts power plants and also settled a number of additional issues on completed construction projects in its former engineering and construction businesses. The Company recorded an after-tax loss from discontinued operations for the quarter of $14 million, related to its former engineering and construction and Aircraft Integration Systems businesses.
