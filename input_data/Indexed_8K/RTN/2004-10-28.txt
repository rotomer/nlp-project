FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Raytheon Reports Strong Third Quarter 2004 EPS of $0.41 from Continuing Operations
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (Oct. 28, 2004)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported third quarter 2004 income from continuing operations of $186 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $21 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter 2003. The third quarter 2003 included charges of $226 million or $0.38 per diluted share at Network Centric Systems (NCS) and Technical Services (TS). Non-cash pension expense (FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment) negatively affected the third quarter 2004 by $0.13 per diluted share on a year-over-year basis.
,
 
Third quarter 2004 net income was $152 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $35 million or $0.08 per diluted share in 2003. Net income for the third quarter of 2004 also included a $34 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily attributable to a foreign tax related matter, versus $56 million or $0.13 per diluted share in 2003.
 
Net sales for the third quarter 2004 were $4.9 billion, up 13 percent from $4.4 billion in the comparable period in 2003. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 12 percent to $4.1 billion from $3.7 billion in the comparable quarter. Sales in the third quarter 2003 included a $212 million reduction resulting from the 2003 NCS and TS charges. Excluding the effect of the 2003 charges, 2004 sales increased over 2003 for the Company by 8 percent and for Government and Defense by 6 percent.
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter was $220 million. Excluding the impact of the shareholder lawsuit settlement payment of $210 million, free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $430 million versus $535 million for the comparable period in 2003. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations remains ahead of prior year. Discontinued operations consumed $16 million of cash in the third quarter 2004 versus $64 million in the comparable period in 2003. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending.
 
The Government and Defense businesses recorded third quarter bookings of $4.8 billion compared to bookings of $4.1 billion in the third quarter of 2003. Government and Defense backlog reached a record $30.1 billion at the end of the third quarter 2004.
 
Raytheon Aircraft Company's third quarter bookings were $704 million compared to $383 million in 2003.
 
"I am very pleased that Raytheon continues to deliver positive results," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. "Our program execution and strong customer focus are driving the Company's performance."
 
During the third quarter of 2004, the Company retired debt with a par value of $137 million, bringing the total debt reduction year-to-date to $1.0 billion. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company initiated the retirement of an additional $1.2 billion of debt, bringing the total expected debt retirement for the year to $2.3 billion. The Company expects to take a charge in the fourth quarter of $90 million or $0.13 per diluted share associated with this debt retirement. Net debt was $5.3 billion at the end of the third quarter compared with $6.7 billion at the end of 2003. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and short-term investments.
 
Change in Outlook
 
The Company now expects 2004 earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87 - $0.92, higher than its prior guidance of $0.79 - $0.89, as a result of improvements at RAC and at the Government and Defense businesses. The higher guidance includes income of $0.10 per diluted share as a result of legislation that extended the foreign tax credit from five to 10 years and the loss of $0.12 per diluted share from the early retirement of debt, net of interest savings. The Company now expects full year free cash flow to exceed $1.1 billion.
 
Earnings per share from continuing operations in 2005 are expected to be $1.80 - $1.90. This earnings guidance does not reflect any change in our previously disclosed pension assumptions. The Company expects net sales for 2005 of $21.5 - $22.0 billion. Government and Defense net sales for 2005 are expected to be $18.0 - $18.5 billion (after the elimination of intercompany sales). RAC net sales for 2005 are expected to be $2.6 - $2.8 billion. The Company expects 2005 free cash flow of $1.1 - $1.3 billion. Charts containing the Company's guidance are available on the Company's website.

The Company uses certain of these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and to determine management incentive compensation. The Company also uses non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain charges and credits because it believes that such items are not indicative of its core operating results, are not indicative of trends, and
do not provide meaningful comparisons with other reporting periods.
