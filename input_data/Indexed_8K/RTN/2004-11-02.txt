On October 27, 2004, the Registrant issued notice of a $200 million draw from its existing Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility, dated as of November 28, 2001 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Credit Agreement"), among the Registrant, as Borrower, Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, a Delaware corporation, and Raytheon Aircraft Company, a Kansas corporation, each as a Guarantor, the several lenders from time to time parties to the Credit Agreement (the "Lenders"), J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, Citicorp USA, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston and Mizuho Financial Group, each as a documentation agent, Bank of America, N.A., as the syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as the administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent").
