WALTHAMMass., (Feb. 3, 2005)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported fourth quarter 2004 income from continuing operations of $246 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared to $217 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2003.

Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003 included a net after-tax charge of $13 million and $14 million, respectively. The net charge in the fourth quarter 2004 consisted of an after-tax $55 million charge ($85 million pretax) from the early redemption of debt and a $42 million benefit from the change in the tax law which extends the carry forward period of foreign tax credits. The net charge in the fourth quarter 2003 consisted of an after-tax $50 million charge ($77 million pretax) from the early redemption of debt and an after-tax $36 million gain ($55 million pretax) from the sale of the Company's remaining investment in its former aviation support business.
 
Fourth quarter 2004 net income, including the effects of discontinued operations, was $245 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared to $205 million or $0.49 per diluted share in 2003.
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter 2004 were $5.7 billion, up 12 percent from $5.1 billion in the comparable period in 2003. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 12 percent to $4.7 billion from $4.2 billion in the comparable quarter.
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $712 million versus $906 million for the comparable period in 2003. Free cash flow is defined by the Company as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company retired $1.2 billion of debt, bringing the total year debt reduction to $2.2 billion. Net debt was $4.6 billion at the end of 2004 compared with $6.7 billion at the end of 2003. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.
 
"In 2004 we said we would focus on predictable performance, strong relationships, and innovative customer solutions. We did what we said we were going to do and then some," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. "This is our fifth consecutive quarter of predictable financial performance. Our focus on the customer is paying dividends and more importantly, we continue to build on the trust and confidence they have in Raytheon which is reflected in our growth."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Fourth Quarter 2004
 
Free cash flow is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under SEC regulations. The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Our definition may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The Company uses free cash flow to facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results and as an element of management incentive compensation. The Company believes disclosure of free cash flow performance provides investors greater transparency with respect to information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. While this information may be useful in evaluating the Company, it should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
