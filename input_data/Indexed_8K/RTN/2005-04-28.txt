FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Raytheon Reports Strong First Quarter 2005 Performance and Increases Full-year Guidance for EPS and Bookings
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (Apr. 28, 2005)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported first quarter 2005 income from continuing operations of $196 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $101 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter 2004. First quarter 2005 income from continuing operations included a $12 million charge or $0.03 per diluted share for a previously announced offer of settlement submitted to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve an investigation primarily related to Raytheon Aircraft Company's (RAC) commuter aircraft business during the period from 1997 to 2001. First quarter 2005 income from continuing operations was higher due to better operating results in the Government and Defense businesses and at RAC combined with lower interest expense. Non-cash pension expense (FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment) was $116 million in the first quarter 2005 compared with $121 million in the comparable period last year.
,
 
"The Company is off to a great start for the year," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Our bookings and operating performance demonstrate that the Company is continuing to execute well, with the Government and Defense businesses as well as Raytheon Aircraft delivering strong results. Our plan to put risk and uncertainty behind us and our strategy to focus on customer success are showing positive results."
First quarter 2005 net income was $166 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $128 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2004. Net income for the first quarter of 2005 included a $30 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.07 per diluted share, versus $14 million or $0.03 per diluted share in 2004. The $30 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2005 included a $25 million after-tax charge for the previously announced settlement of a class action shareholder lawsuit related to the July 2000 sale of the Company's engineering and construction businesses. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 included a $41 million or $0.10 per diluted share benefit from a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to the change in the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans measurement date from Oct. 31 to Dec. 31.
 
Net sales for the first quarter 2005 were $4.9 billion, up 6 percent from $4.7 billion in the comparable period in 2004. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 4 percent to $4.3 billion from $4.1 billion in the comparable quarter. RAC sales for the quarter increased 18 percent to $442 million from $374 million in the 2004 comparable period.
 
Free cash from continuing operations for the first quarter was an outflow of $338 million versus an outflow of $200 million for the comparable period in 2004. During the quarter the Company made a $200 million discretionary cash contribution to its pension plans. Free cash flow from continuing operations was significantly better than prior guidance, driven primarily by the earlier receipt of collections and as a result of a very successful financial system implementation. Free cash flow is defined by the Company as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending.
 
During the first quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $53 million as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program.
 
Net debt was $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter compared with $4.6 billion at the end of 2004. Net debt increased in the current quarter primarily due to seasonal trends and the $200 million discretionary cash contribution made to the Company's pension plans.
As was previously announced, during the quarter the Company increased the quarterly dividend 10 percent to 22 cents per outstanding share of common stock from 20 cents per outstanding share of common stock. This was the first dividend increase since 1996.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
First Quarter 2005
 
Free cash flow is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under SEC regulations. The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Our definition may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The Company uses free cash flow to facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results and as an element of management incentive compensation. The Company believes disclosure of free cash flow performance provides investors greater transparency with respect to information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. While this information may be useful in evaluating the Company, it should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
Free cash flow

* Cash flow from operations now includes financing and collection of aircraft receivables.
