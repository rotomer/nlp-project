FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
Raytheon Reports 10 Percent Sales Growth in Second Quarter 2005 and Increases Full-year Guidance
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (Jul. 28, 2005)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported second quarter 2005 income from continuing operations of $233 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared to a loss from continuing operations of $94 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the second quarter 2004. Second quarter 2004 income from continuing operations, excluding the effect of charges for the settlement of a class action shareholder lawsuit and the early retirement of debt, was $152 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Second quarter 2005 income from continuing operations was higher due to better operating results in the Government and Defense businesses and at Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) combined with lower interest expense.
,
 
"I continue to be pleased with performance throughout the Company," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "The strength of our bookings and record backlog demonstrate that the Company is well positioned for future growth."
 
Second quarter 2005 net income was $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $108 million or $0.25 per diluted share in 2004. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 included a $32 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily attributable to foreign tax related matters, versus a $14 million after-tax loss or $0.03 per diluted share in 2004.
Net sales for the second quarter 2005 were $5.4 billion, up 10 percent from $4.9 billion in the comparable period in 2004. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 8 percent to $4.5 billion from $4.2 billion in the comparable quarter. RAC sales for the quarter increased 21 percent to $687 million from $570 million in the 2004 comparable quarter.
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter 2005 was $736 million versus $820 million for the comparable period in 2004, a decrease primarily due to timing of collections. Year-to-date free cash flow was $398 million versus $620 million for the comparable period in 2004, a decrease primarily due to a $200 million discretionary cash contribution to the Company's pension plans made in the first quarter of 2005. Free cash flow is defined by the Company as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending.
 
During the second quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for $139 million as part of the Company's previously announced $700 million share repurchase program, bringing the total shares of common stock repurchased year-to-date to 4.9 million for $192 million.
 
Net debt was $4.6 billion at the end of the second quarter 2005 and at the end of 2004.
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
The Government and Defense businesses recorded strong second quarter 2005 bookings of $7.3 billion compared to bookings of $5.0 billion in the second quarter of 2004, a 46 percent increase primarily due to two large bookings at Integrated Defense Systems.
 
Raytheon Aircraft Company's second quarter 2005 bookings were $602 million compared to $851 million in the 2004 comparable quarter. Second quarter 2004 bookings included a single order in excess of $300 million.
 
The Company ended the quarter with a record backlog of $34.6 billion compared to $32.5 billion at the end of 2004. The Government and Defense businesses ended the quarter with a backlog of $31.8 billion compared to $29.6 billion at the end of 2004.
 
 
Outlook
 
The Company now expects 2005 earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.90-$2.00 versus its previous guidance of $1.85-$1.95. The Company raised its full year guidance for net sales to $21.6-$22.1 billion from $21.5-$22.0 billion. The Company now expects net interest expense to be $285-$300 million versus its previous guidance of $300-$315 million. The Company raised its full year guidance for bookings to $23.7-$24.7 billion from $23.2-$24.2 billion. Charts containing the Company's guidance are available on the Company's website at .

Segment Results
 
Integrated Defense Systems
 
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had second quarter 2005 net sales of $940 million, up 8 percent compared to $870 million in the second quarter 2004, primarily due to growth in international Patriot programs and the Cobra Judy program partially offset, as expected, by lower sales on the Sea-Based Radar program. IDS recorded $139 million of second quarter 2005 operating income compared to $104 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Operating income was higher primarily due to increased sales on international programs and profit adjustments on contracts nearing completion.
 
During the quarter, IDS booked $1.7 billion of a $3 billion award to continue the ship system integration and detail design for the U.S. Navy's DD(X) Destroyer. IDS also booked $631 million to provide Taiwan with an Early Warning Surveillance Radar System. These were partially offset by a backlog adjustment of $700 million due to a customer funding profile change to the JLENS program, which is expected to be restored to backlog later this year.
Intelligence and Information Systems
 
 
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) had second quarter 2005 net sales of $630 million, up 8 percent compared to $583 million in the second quarter 2004, primarily due to continued growth in classified programs.

Missile Systems
 
 
Missile Systems (MS) had second quarter 2005 net sales of $1,007 million, up 7 percent compared to $939 million in the second quarter 2004, primarily due to a ramp up on Tactical Tomahawk and several new programs. MS recorded $104 million of operating income compared to $106 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Last year's second quarter operating income included cost recovery for prior year restructuring actions.
 
During the quarter, MS booked $163 million for the production of 251 Evolved SeaSparrow Missiles (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and nine other allied nations. MS also booked $111 million for a classified contract.
Network Centric Systems
 
 
Network Centric Systems (NCS) had second quarter 2005 net sales of $804 million, up 6 percent compared to $758 million in the second quarter 2004 primarily due to increased effort on development programs and communication programs.

During the quarter, NCS booked $485 million for the definitization of the Ground Sensor Integrator (GSI) on the Future Combat System (FCS) contract initially awarded in the third quarter of 2003, bringing the total booked to over $1 billion on this program.

Space and Airborne Systems
 
 
Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) had second quarter 2005 net sales of $1,060 million, up 8 percent compared to $985 million in the second quarter 2004 primarily due to growth in ATFLIR production and airborne radar programs.

During the quarter, SAS booked $586 million for the production of 190 APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars for the F/A-18 Super Hornet program. SAS also booked $130 million on a number of classified contracts.

TS also booked a mission support contract valued at $29 million to provide avionics maintenance to AP-3C aircraft for the Australian Commonwealth.
 
Aircraft
 
 
Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) had second quarter 2005 net sales of $687 million, up 21 percent from $570 million in the second quarter 2004. RAC recorded operating income of $33 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the comparable quarter in 2004.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Second Quarter 2005
 
This release contains non-GAAP financial measures (as defined by SEC Regulation G). While these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP" financial measures under SEC guidelines:
 
 
 
Free cash flow is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under SEC regulations. The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Our definition may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The Company uses free cash flow to facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results and as an element of management incentive compensation. The Company believes disclosure of free cash flow performance provides investors greater transparency with respect to information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The Company also uses non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain charges and credits because it believes that such items are not indicative of its core operating results, are not indicative of trends, and do not provide meaningful comparisons with other reporting periods.
