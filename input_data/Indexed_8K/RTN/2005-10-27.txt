FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Raytheon Reports Strong Third Quarter 2005 EPS of $0.51 from Continuing Operations, up 24 percent
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (Oct. 27, 2005)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported third quarter 2005 income from continuing operations of $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared to $186 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the third quarter 2004. Third quarter 2005 income from continuing operations was higher due to better operating results in both the Government and Defense businesses and at Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) combined with lower interest expense.
,
 
Third quarter 2005 net income was $228 million or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $152 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the third quarter 2004. Net income for the third quarter of 2005 included a $3 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.01 per diluted share versus a $34 million after-tax loss or $0.07 per diluted share in the third quarter 2004.
 
"Our performance and operating results this quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of the Company," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "This strength is reflected in our increased 2005 guidance for full-year EPS, bookings and free cash flow from continuing operations."
Net sales for the third quarter 2005 were $5.3 billion, up 8 percent from $4.9 billion in the 2004 comparable quarter. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 9 percent to $4.5 billion from $4.1 billion in the 2004 comparable quarter. RAC sales for the quarter increased 3 percent to $642 million from $624 million in the 2004 comparable quarter.
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter 2005 was $702 million versus $268 million for the 2004 comparable quarter. In the third quarter 2004, the Company made a $210 million payment to settle a shareholder lawsuit. Free cash flow is defined by the Company as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending.
 
During the third quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of common stock for $198 million as part of the Company's previously announced $700 million share repurchase program, bringing the total shares of common stock repurchased year-to-date to 10 million for $390 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Third Quarter 2005
 
Free cash flow is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under SEC regulations. The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Our definition may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The Company uses free cash flow to facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results and as an element of management incentive compensation. The Company believes disclosure of free cash flow performance provides investors greater transparency with respect to information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. While this information may be useful in evaluating the Company, it should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
