WALTHAMMass., (Feb. 2, 2006)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported fourth quarter 2005 income from continuing operations of $282 million or $0.63 per diluted share compared to $246 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 net income was $276 million or $0.61 per diluted share compared to $245 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2004.
,
 
"Raytheon had another good year," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "We had strong results across the Company and ended the year with the lowest net debt in ten years. This once again demonstrates our continued commitment to our customers and shareholders."
 
Fourth quarter 2005 results included an after-tax $30 million gain ($45 million pretax) or $0.07 per diluted share from the sale of the Company's stake in its Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture. Fourth quarter 2005 results also included an after-tax $19 million impairment
 
charge ($22 million pretax) or $0.04 per diluted share related to the Company's investment in Flight Options. Also, during the fourth quarter 2005, the Company recorded an after-tax $7 million charge ($10 million pretax) or $0.02 per diluted share from the early redemption of debt. Fourth quarter 2004 results included a net after-tax $13 million charge or $0.03 per diluted share related to a charge for the early redemption of debt partially offset by a benefit from the change in the tax law.
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter 2005 were $6.2 billion, up 9 percent from $5.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2004. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 5 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2004. Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) sales for the quarter increased 27 percent to $1,085 million from $853 million in the fourth quarter 2004.
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2005 was $1,033 million versus $760 million for the fourth quarter 2004. Free cash flow is defined by the Company as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending and constitutes a non-GAAP financial measure. See Attachment F "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a reconciliation of free cash flow to operating cash flow and a discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP financial information.
 
During the fourth quarter 2005, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $46 million as part of the Company's previously announced $700 million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased 11.2 million shares of common stock in 2005 for $436 million. Also during the quarter, the Company retired $196 million of debt, bringing the total year debt reduction to $678 million. Net debt was $3.3 billion at the end of 2005 compared with $4.6 billion at the end of 2004.

For the full year the Company reported income from continuing operations of $942 million or $2.08 per diluted share compared to $439 million or $0.99 per diluted share in 2004. The Company reported 2005 net income of $871 million or $1.92 per diluted share compared to $417 million or $0.94 per diluted share in 2004.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Fourth Quarter 2005
 
Free cash flow is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under SEC regulations. The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow less capital spending and internal use software spending. Our definition may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The Company uses free cash flow to facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results and as an element of management incentive compensation. The Company believes disclosure of free cash flow performance provides investors greater transparency with respect to information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. While this information may be useful in evaluating the Company, it should be considered supplemental to and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
