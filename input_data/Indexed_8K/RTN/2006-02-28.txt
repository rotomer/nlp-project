ITEM 1.01
ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
Named Executive Officer Compensation
 
On February 23, 2006, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), approved the payment of incentive cash awards pursuant to the 2005 Results-Based Incentive Program (the "2005 RBI Program") for the Named Executive Officers as set forth in the table below. The equally-weighted performance metrics established for the 2005 RBI Program were free cash flow, working capital turns, bookings, net revenue, and operating profit from continuing operations. The Committee determined that the Company exceeded its targets within each metric.
 
Each participating key employee, including the Named Executive Officers, had the opportunity to earn incentive cash compensation based upon a pre-established individual payout target expressed as a percentage of base salary determined by the level of responsibility of the participating key employee. The Committee established individual payout targets for each executive officer and key employee based upon an examination of compensation information compiled by an outside consultant from a peer group of public companies of a similar revenue size or that compete in the Company's primary business areas.
 
Actual payouts under the 2005 RBI Program were based upon the attainment of the specific pre-established performance metrics and an assessment of individual performance. Individual awards for executive officers under the program reflect the executive's contribution to the achievement of the pre-established performance metrics, the successful management of human resources, the furtherance of ethical business behavior and leadership competencies, the achievement of the executive's individual pre-established performance goals, and the degree of challenge in the executive's position. The Named Executive Officers received the following awards:

Kelble, Vice President and former President of the Company's Space and Airborne Systems business unit, in connection with his scheduled retirement from the Company effective March 1, 2006. Mr. Kelble's retirement benefits also include the lapsing of restrictions on 4,000 additional shares of restricted stock on his scheduled retirement date.
