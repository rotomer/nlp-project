FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Raytheon Reports Strong First Quarter 2006 Results and Increases Full-year
Guidance for EPS and Operating Cash Flow
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (Apr. 27, 2006)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported first quarter 2006 income from continuing operations of $289 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to $196 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter 2005. First quarter 2006 income from continuing operations included an after-tax $14 million gain ($21 million pretax) or $0.03 per diluted share for the sale of the Company's investment in Space Imaging. First quarter 2005 income from continuing operations included a $12 million charge or $0.03 per diluted share for a legal settlement. First quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was higher due to improved operating results at the Company's Government and Defense businesses and at Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) combined with lower net interest expense and lower non-cash pension expense.
,
"Our strong earnings and cash flow allow us to increase guidance for the year," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Our financial performance in the first quarter, along with our record backlog, continues to demonstrate our focus on strong execution throughout the Company."
First quarter 2006 net income was $287 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to $166 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the first quarter 2005. Net income for the first quarter of 2005 included a $30 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.07 per diluted share primarily attributable to an after-tax charge for the settlement of a class action shareholder lawsuit.
Net sales for the first quarter 2006 were $5.2 billion, up 4 percent from $4.9 billion in the first quarter 2005. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of intercompany sales) increased 4 percent to $4.5 billion from $4.3 billion in the first quarter 2005. RAC sales for the quarter increased 12 percent to $493 million from $442 million in the first quarter 2005.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter 2006 was a positive $5 million versus an outflow of $274 million for the first quarter 2005. The improvement in cash flow was driven by higher income as well as a prior year delay in billings and collections resulting from a financial system implementation. The Company made a $200 million discretionary cash contribution to its pension plans in the first quarters of both 2006 and 2005.
During the first quarter 2006, the Company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $102 million as part of the Company's previously announced (December 2004) $700 million share repurchase program. The Company has repurchased 13.6 million shares of common stock since the program's inception for a total of $538 million. As previously announced (March 2006), the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, as well as a 9 percent increase to the Company's annual dividend, from $0.88 to $0.96 per share.
Net debt was $3.5 billion at the end of the first quarter 2006 compared with $3.3 billion at the end of 2005 and $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter 2005. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.
Bookings and Backlog
 
The Government and Defense businesses reported first quarter 2006 bookings of $4.8 billion compared to $4.6 billion in the first quarter 2005. RAC reported first quarter 2006 bookings of $500 million compared to $472 million in the first quarter 2005.
The Government and Defense businesses ended the first quarter 2006 with a backlog of $31.5 billion compared to $31.2 billion at the end of 2005. Raytheon ended the quarter with a record backlog of $34.7 billion compared to $34.4 billion at the end of 2005.
Outlook
 
* As of February 2, 2006
The Company has increased full-year 2006 guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations, operating cash flow, and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), as well as improved full-year 2006 guidance for net interest expense.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
First Quarter 2006
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under SEC regulations. The Company defines ROIC as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of the operating lease expense), divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8) and adding financial guarantees. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC to make the most efficient and effective use of capital and as an element of management incentive compensation.
