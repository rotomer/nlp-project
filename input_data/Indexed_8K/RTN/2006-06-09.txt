The Settlement Warrants will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to an exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of that Act. The Settlement Warrants have an initial exercise price of $37.50 per share of common stock and are expected to be issued in late June 2006. They will not be exercisable after the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance.
The description above is a summary of the Warrant Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the Warrant Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report.
