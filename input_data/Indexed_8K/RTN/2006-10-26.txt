FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Raytheon Reports Strong Third Quarter 2006 Results and Increases 2006 Full-year Guidance
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (October 26, 2006)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported third quarter 2006 income from continuing operations of $323 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the third quarter 2005. Third quarter 2006 net income was $321 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $228 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the third quarter 2005. Third quarter 2006 net income was higher primarily due to improved operating results at Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) and Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), combined with a reduction in pension expense.
,
"Raytheon had another very strong quarter," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Our operating results demonstrate the Company's continued focus on execution, and as a result, the Company is able to increase its full-year EPS, bookings, cash flow, and ROIC guidance."
Net sales for the third quarter 2006 were $5.7 billion, up 7 percent from $5.3 billion in the third quarter 2005. Government and Defense sales for the quarter (after the elimination of
 
intercompany sales) increased 5 percent to $4.7 billion from $4.5 billion in the third quarter 2005. RAC sales for the quarter increased 18 percent to $758 million from $642 million in the third quarter 2005.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter 2006 was $750 million versus $798 million for the third quarter 2005. Year-to-date operating cash flow from continuing operations was $1,194 million versus $1,344 million for the comparable period in 2005. The decrease in both the third quarter and year-to-date 2006 versus the comparable periods in 2005 is primarily due to higher cash tax payments in 2006.
During the third quarter 2006, the Company repurchased 5.5 million shares of common stock for $250 million as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase programs. The Company has repurchased 7.9 million shares of common stock year-to-date for $352 million.
Net debt was $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter 2006 compared with $3.3 billion at year-end 2005 and $4.2 billion at the end of the third quarter 2005. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.
 
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
 
The Government and Defense businesses reported third quarter 2006 bookings of $5.2 billion compared to $3.4 billion in the third quarter 2005, an increase driven by several programs in Missile Systems (MS) and Network Centric Systems (NCS). RAC reported third quarter 2006 bookings of $717 million compared to $572 million in the third quarter 2005.
The Government and Defense businesses ended the third quarter 2006 with a backlog of $31.7 billion compared to $31.2 billion at the end of 2005. The Company ended the quarter with a backlog of $34.6 billion compared to $34.4 billion at the end of 2005.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Third Quarter 2006
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a "non-GAAP" financial measure under SEC regulations. The Company defines ROIC as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of the operating lease expense), divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8) and adding financial guarantees. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC to make the most efficient and effective use of capital and as an element of management incentive compensation.
