Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 20, 2006, Raytheon Company (the "Company") and its subsidiaries, Raytheon Aircraft Holdings, Inc., ("RAHI") and Raytheon Aircraft Services Limited (together with RAHI, the "Sellers"), entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to sell the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Raytheon Aircraft Company ("RAC"), to Hawker Beechcraft Corporation and Greenbulb Limited (collectively, the "Purchaser"), for approximately $3.3 billion in cash. The transaction includes RAC facilities and other assets in Wichita and Salina, Kansas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Dallas, Texas; as well as its Fixed Based Operations network across the United States, United Kingdom and Mexico.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company, the Sellers, and the Purchaser. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the absence of a material adverse effect on RAC and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2007. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated in certain limited circumstances, including upon the failure of the closing of the transaction to occur on or before April 30, 2007, subject, in certain limited instances, to an extension until June 30, 2007. Certain affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Onex Partners, who own the equity interests in the Purchaser, have guaranteed the obligations of the Purchaser to pay a termination fee of $100 million to the Company pursuant to the Purchase Agreement should the agreement be terminated by the Company as a result of a material breach by the Purchaser of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement that is not cured within thirty days following notice of such breach or as a result of the Purchaser's failure to satisfy its obligation to close following a specified period after the delivery by the Company of certain financial information.
The above summary is qualified in its entirety by the Purchase Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company expects net after-tax proceeds from the transaction to be approximately $2.5 billion.
Subject to the closing of the transaction, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, commencing in 2007. Also, subject to the closing of the transaction, the Board of Directors has authorized the early retirement of approximately $1.0 billion of the Company's outstanding notes and debentures. This is in addition to the $685 million of scheduled debt maturities in 2007.
The Company will now report RAC as a discontinued operation.
The transaction does not include the Company's ownership in either Flight Options, LLC or Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC, both of which are reported in the "Other" segment of the Company's financial statements.
