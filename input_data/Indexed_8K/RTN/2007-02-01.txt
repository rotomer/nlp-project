On February 1, 2007, Raytheon Company issued a press release announcing financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this report, including Exhibit 99.1, is furnished in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
On February 1, 2007, the Company issued a press release which reported the following:
Raytheon reported fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.65 per diluted share compared to $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to improved operating results at Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Missile Systems (MS), and Network Centric Systems (NCS), partially offset by an after-tax goodwill impairment charge in the Flight Options business of $48 million ($55 million pretax) or $0.11 per diluted share.
As previously announced, Raytheon signed a definitive agreement in December 2006 to sell its wholly owned subsidiary, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC). This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2007. As a result, Raytheon is now reporting RAC as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
Fourth quarter 2006 net income was $365 million or $0.81 per diluted share compared to $276 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter 2006 included $73 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.16 per diluted share, primarily due to the results of RAC, versus $45 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter 2006 also included an after-tax goodwill impairment charge in the Flight Options business of $48 million ($55 million pretax) or $0.11 per diluted share versus an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $19 million ($22 million pretax) or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005. Net sales for the fourth quarter 2006 were $5.7 billion, up 12 percent from $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to IDS, MS and NCS. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2006 was $1.3 billion versus $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2005. The increase in the fourth quarter 2006 versus the fourth quarter 2005 was primarily due to reductions in working capital. Net debt was $1.51 billion at year-end 2006 compared with $3.25 billion at year-end 2005. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.
In the fourth quarter 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which resulted in a $1.9 billion increase to Liabilities and a $1.3 billion after-tax reduction to Stockholders' Equity.
For the full year the Company reported income from continuing operations of $1,107 million or $2.46 per diluted share compared to $818 million or $1.80 per diluted share in 2005, primarily due to improved operating results at IDS, MS and NCS combined with lower net interest expense and a reduction in pension expense. The Company reported 2006 net income of $1,283 million or $2.85 per diluted share compared to $871 million or $1.92 per diluted share in 2005. Net income for 2006 included $176 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.39 per diluted share, versus $53 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.12 per diluted share in 2005, primarily related to RAC. Total 2006 net sales for the Company were $20.3 billion compared to $19.0 billion for 2005, an increase of 7 percent, primarily due to IDS, MS and NCS. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.5 billion in 2006 compared to $2.3 billion in 2005. The increase in 2006 versus 2005 is primarily due to higher net income partially offset by higher cash tax payments in 2006.
The Company reported total bookings for the fourth quarter 2006 of $7.8 billion compared to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2005, an increase driven primarily by several bookings at IDS, MS, NCS and Space and Airborne Systems (SAS). The Company reported full-year 2006 bookings of $23.0 billion, up 8 percent compared to $21.3 billion for full-year 2005. The Company ended 2006 with a record backlog of $33.8 billion compared to $31.5 billion at the end of 2005.
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had fourth quarter 2006 net sales of $1,189 million, up 14 percent compared to $1,042 million in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to growth in DDG 1000 and international programs. IDS recorded $189 million of operating income compared to $154 million in the fourth quarter 2005. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher volume and program performance improvements on domestic and international programs. During the quarter, IDS booked $558 million for additional development work, including ship integration and detail design, for the U.S. Navy's DDG 1000 Destroyer program. IDS also booked $419 million for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) development for the U.S. Army, bringing the total JLENS booking to $1.4 billion.
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) had fourth quarter 2006 net sales of $690 million compared to $688 million in the fourth quarter 2005. IIS recorded $63 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2006 and the fourth quarter 2005. During the quarter, IIS booked $448 million on a number of classified contracts, including $110 million on a major classified contract, bringing the total classified bookings for the year to $1.5 billion.
Missile Systems (MS) had fourth quarter 2006 net sales of $1,316 million, up 17 percent compared to $1,122 million in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to a ramp up on Standard Missile, international Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), and several development programs. MS recorded $138 million of operating income compared to $118 million in the fourth quarter 2005. During the quarter, MS booked $780 million for additional development on the Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) system program for the Missile Defense Agency. MS also booked $271 million for the production of 500 AMRAAM missiles and $117 million for additional development on Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) for the U.S. Navy.
Network Centric Systems (NCS) had fourth quarter 2006 net sales of $1,011 million, up 25 percent compared to $806 million in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to growth in the Combat Systems business. NCS recorded $117 million of operating income compared to $89 million in the fourth quarter 2005. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher volume and program performance improvements. During the quarter, NCS booked $363 million to provide Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) forward-looking infrared kits and systems to the U.S. Army. NCS also booked $162 million for the production of Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) for the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps.
Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) had fourth quarter 2006 net sales of $1,175 million, up 3 percent compared to $1,145 million in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to growth in Airborne Radar Production programs. SAS recorded $159 million of operating income compared to $162 million in the fourth quarter 2005. Operating income was lower primarily due to favorable program profit and cost adjustments recorded in the prior year from certain production programs and a higher current year mix of development programs. During the quarter, SAS booked $182 million for the production of Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) pods and spares for the U.S. Navy as well as $135 million to develop a tactical radar for rotary and fixed wing platforms for the U.S. Army. SAS also booked $367 million on a number of classified contracts, including $233 million on a major classified contract, bringing the total classified bookings for the year to $1.5 billion.
Technical Services (TS) had fourth quarter 2006 net sales of $604 million, up 15 percent compared to $525 million in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to growth in the Logistics and Training Systems business. TS recorded operating income of $47 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $39 million in the fourth quarter 2005. During the quarter, TS booked $217 million on a number of Logistics and Training Systems business contracts.
Net sales for the Other segment in the fourth quarter 2006 were $246 million compared to $215 million in the fourth quarter 2005. The segment recorded an operating loss of $61 million in the fourth quarter 2006, which included a pretax goodwill impairment charge in the Flight Options business of $55 million, compared to an operating loss of $51 million in the fourth quarter 2005, which included a pretax goodwill impairment charge of $22 million in the Flight Options business. The $10 million increase in operating loss was due to the Flight Options impairment charge partially offset by improved operating performance.
During the quarter, the Company recorded net income from discontinued operations of $73 million, compared to $45 million in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily related to RAC.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WALTHAMMass., (February 1, 2007)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations of $292 million or $0.65 per diluted share compared to $231 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to improved operating results at Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Missile Systems (MS), and Network Centric Systems (NCS), partially offset by an after-tax goodwill impairment charge in the Flight Options business of $48 million ($55 million pretax) or $0.11 per diluted share.
,
As previously announced, Raytheon signed a definitive agreement in December 2006 to sell its wholly owned subsidiary, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC). This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2007.
 
As a result, Raytheon is now reporting RAC as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
"Our strong backlog, bookings, sales, earnings, and cash flow are positive indicators of our focus on the customer, which in turn enhances shareholder value," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Raytheon's outstanding technology is providing capabilities for our customers' missions today and into the future."
Fourth quarter 2006 net income was $365 million or $0.81 per diluted share compared to $276 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter 2006 included $73 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.16 per diluted share, primarily due to the results of RAC, versus $45 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter 2006 also included an after-tax goodwill impairment charge in the Flight Options business of $48 million ($55 million pretax) or $0.11 per diluted share versus an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $19 million ($22 million pretax) or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2005.
Net sales for the fourth quarter 2006 were $5.7 billion, up 12 percent from $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to IDS, MS and NCS.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2006 was $1.3 billion versus $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2005. The increase in the fourth quarter 2006 versus the fourth quarter 2005 was primarily due to reductions in working capital.
Net debt was $1.51 billion at year-end 2006 compared with $3.25 billion at year-end 2005. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Both Fitch and Standard & Poor's ratings services recently upgraded Raytheon's credit rating to BBB+.
In the fourth quarter 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which resulted in a $1.9 billion increase to Liabilities and a $1.3 billion after-tax reduction to Stockholders' Equity.
 
Full Year Financial Results
For the full year the Company reported income from continuing operations of $1,107 million or $2.46 per diluted share compared to $818 million or $1.80 per diluted share in 2005, primarily due to improved operating results at IDS, MS and NCS combined with lower net interest expense and a reduction in pension expense.
The Company reported 2006 net income of $1,283 million or $2.85 per diluted share compared to $871 million or $1.92 per diluted share in 2005.

Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.5 billion in 2006 compared to $2.3 billion in 2005. The increase in 2006 versus 2005 is primarily due to higher net income partially offset by higher cash tax payments in 2006.
 
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
 
The Company reported total bookings for the fourth quarter 2006 of $7.8 billion compared to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2005, an increase driven primarily by several bookings at IDS, MS, NCS and Space and Airborne Systems (SAS).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Fourth Quarter 2006
Our revised definition of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is the same as our prior definition except shareholder's equity is now adjusted to add back the cumulative impact of minimum pension liability/impact of adopting FAS 158. We define ROIC as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the cumulative minimum pension liability/impact of adopting FAS 158. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information performed in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC as a measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
