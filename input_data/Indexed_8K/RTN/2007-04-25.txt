FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Raytheon Reports Strong First Quarter Results
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (April 25, 2007)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported first quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $314 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $272 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the first quarter 2006. First quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to improved operating results at Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Missile Systems (MS), and Network Centric Systems (NCS).
,
"Our first quarter was another good quarter for the Company and a strong start to the year," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO.
First quarter 2007 net income was $346 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared to $287 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the first quarter 2006. Net income for the first quarter 2007 included $32 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the results of Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), versus $15 million of income from discontinued operations or $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter 2006. As previously announced, after the first quarter close, Raytheon completed the sale of RAC to Hawker Beechcraft Inc. for $3.3 billion, with after-tax net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion.
 
The Company expects to record a net after-tax gain of approximately $1 billion in the second quarter.
Net sales for the first quarter 2007 were $4.9 billion, up 6 percent from $4.7 billion in the first quarter 2006.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter 2007 was an outflow of $379 million versus an outflow of $48 million for the first quarter 2006. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to a $400 million discretionary cash contribution made to the Company's pension plans in the first quarter 2007 versus a $200 million discretionary cash contribution made in the first quarter 2006.
During the first quarter 2007, the Company repurchased 5.1 million shares for $275 million as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. In addition, as announced in March 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 6 percent increase to the Company's annual dividend, from $0.96 to $1.02 per share.
Net debt was $2.3 billion at the end of the first quarter 2007 compared with $1.5 billion at year-end 2006. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.
After the completion of the RAC sale in the second quarter, the Company initiated the redemption of approximately $1 billion of debt maturing from 2008 - 2010, which is expected to be completed on April 27, 2007. The Company expects to record a charge in the second quarter of approximately $40 million after-tax ($60 million pretax) primarily associated with the make-whole provision of this early debt retirement.
 
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
The Company reported total bookings for the first quarter 2007 of $5.3 billion compared to $5.0 billion in the first quarter 2006. The Company ended the first quarter 2007 with a record backlog of $33.9 billion compared to $31.8 billion at the end of the first quarter 2006 and $33.8 billion at the end of 2006.
Outlook
 
The Company reaffirms the full-year 2007 outlook as detailed above.

Segment Results
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had first quarter 2007 net sales of $1,092 million, up 13 percent compared to $963 million in the first quarter 2006, primarily due to growth on Missile Defense Agency, U.S. Navy and U.S. Army programs, as well as on international programs.

Intelligence and Information Systems

Technical Services (TS) had first quarter 2007 net sales of $426 million, down 5 percent compared to $450 million in the first quarter 2006, primarily due to lower volume on a support services program, as well as reduced bookings at the end of 2006. TS recorded
 
operating income of $21 million in the first quarter 2007 compared to $31 million in the first quarter 2006. Operating income was lower primarily due to profit adjustments recorded on certain programs and reduced volume.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
First Quarter 2007
We define Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the cumulative minimum pension liability/impact of adopting FAS 158. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
