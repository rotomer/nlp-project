FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Raytheon Reports Strong Second Quarter 2007 Results and Increases Full-year Guidance
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (July 26, 2007)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported second quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $356 million or $0.79 per diluted share compared to $276 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the second quarter 2006. Second quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to operational improvements, combined with lower net interest and pension expense. As previously announced, second quarter 2007 income from continuing operations included a $39 million charge ($59 million pretax) or $0.09 per diluted share for the early redemption of $1.0 billion of debt.
,
"We are very pleased with the Company's solid operating performance in the first half of 2007, along with the significant wins during the quarter on Navy Multiband Terminal and Warfighter FOCUS programs, which represent a potential of $12 billion over the life of these programs," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Our strong operational improvements allow us to increase our 2007 guidance for full-year EPS and bookings."
 
Second quarter 2007 net income was $1,335 million or $2.97 per diluted share compared to $310 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the second quarter 2006. Net income for the second quarter 2007 included $979 million in discontinued operations or $2.18 per diluted share of which $986 million was attributable to the gain on the sale of Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), which was completed in the second quarter. The sale resulted in after-tax net proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion.
Net sales for the second quarter 2007 were $5.4 billion, up 9 percent from $5.0 billion in the second quarter 2006 led by Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Missile Systems (MS) and Network Centric Systems (NCS).
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter 2007 was an outflow of $46 million versus a positive $474 million for the second quarter 2006. The second quarter 2007 included $589 million in cash tax payments versus $101 million in cash tax payments paid in the second quarter 2006. Of the cash taxes paid in the second quarter 2007, $316 million was attributable to the gain on the sale of RAC.
Year-to-date operating cash flow from continuing operations was an outflow of $425 million versus a positive $426 million for the comparable period in 2006. The year-to-date decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to $643 million in cash tax payments ($316 million attributable to the gain on the sale of RAC) in the first half 2007 versus $101 million of cash tax payments made in the first half 2006 combined with the $400 million discretionary cash contribution made to the Company's pension plans in the first quarter 2007 versus the $200 million discretionary cash contribution made in the first quarter 2006.
During the second quarter 2007, the Company repurchased 9.6 million shares for $526 million as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. The Company has repurchased 14.7 million shares of common stock year-to-date for $801 million.
 
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
The Company reported total bookings for the second quarter 2007 of $5.0 billion compared to $4.8 billion in the second quarter 2006. The Company ended the second quarter 2007 with backlog of $33.3 billion compared to $31.5 billion at the end of the second quarter 2006 and $33.8 billion at the end of 2006.
 
Outlook
 
The Company has increased full-year 2007 guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations, bookings and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), and updated net interest expense guidance. Full-year 2007 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations has been revised to reflect approximately $630 million in cash tax payments related to the sale of RAC, of which $316 million was paid in the second quarter 2007, with the remaining $314 million expected to be paid in the second half of 2007. Charts containing additional information on the Company's 2007 performance and guidance are available on the Company's website at See attachment F for the Company's calculation and use of ROIC, a non-GAAP financial measure.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Second Quarter 2007
We define ROIC as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the cumulative minimum pension liability/impact of FAS 158. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
