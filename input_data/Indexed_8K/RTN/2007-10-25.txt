Raytheon Reports Strong Third Quarter 2007 Results; Announces New $2.0 Billion Share Repurchase Plan
 
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (October 25, 2007)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported third quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $304 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $267 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the third quarter 2006. Third quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to operational improvements, combined with lower net interest and pension expense, partially offset by an after-tax impairment charge of $69 million ($84 million pretax) or $0.16 per diluted share in connection with the disposition process of Flight Options. Third quarter 2007 income from continuing operations excluding Flight Options was $380 million or $0.86 per diluted share compared to $274 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the third quarter 2006.

Raytheon also announced that on October 15, 2007, it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Flight Options to H.I.G. Capital, a global private investment firm. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2007.
"Our program execution, strong backlog and customer focus are driving the Company's performance and delivering value to our shareholders," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. "With the pending sale of Flight Options, going forward our attention will be focused on our core business, leading technologies and Mission Support to our global customers."
Third quarter 2007 net income was $299 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared to $321 million or $0.71 per diluted share in the third quarter 2006. Net income for the third
 
(1) Income and EPS from continuing operations excluding Flight Options are non-GAAP financial measures. See attachment G for a reconciliation of these measures to income and EPS from continuing operations under GAAP. We are providing these non-GAAP measures to provide insight on how we expect continuing operations to appear when Flight Options is reported as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter 2007.
quarter 2007 included a $5 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations or $0.01 per diluted share versus a $54 million gain or $0.12 in the third quarter 2006. Third quarter 2006 discontinued operations results included Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), which was sold by the Company in the second quarter 2007.
Net sales for the third quarter 2007 were $5.4 billion, up 8 percent from $4.9 billion in the third quarter 2006 led primarily by Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Missile Systems (MS) and Network Centric Systems (NCS).
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter 2007 was $735 million versus $733 million for the third quarter 2006. The third quarter 2007 included $203 million in cash tax payments versus $53 million in cash tax payments in the third quarter 2006. Of the cash taxes paid in the third quarter 2007, $157 million was attributable to the gain on the sale of RAC.
Year-to-date operating cash flow from continuing operations was $310 million versus $1,159 million for the comparable period in 2006. The year-to-date decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to $846 million in cash tax payments ($473 million attributable to the gain on the sale of RAC) versus $154 million of cash tax payments made in the comparable period in 2006 combined with the $400 million discretionary cash contribution made to the Company's pension plans in the first quarter 2007 versus the $200 million discretionary cash contribution made in the first quarter 2006.
During the third quarter 2007, the Company repurchased 8.6 million shares for $500 million as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. The Company has repurchased 23.3 million shares of common stock year-to-date for $1.3 billion.
The Board of Directors, on October 24, 2007, authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. Share repurchases will take place from time to time at management's discretion depending on market conditions.

Segment Results
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had third quarter 2007 net sales of $1,147 million, up 11 percent compared to $1,030 million in the third quarter 2006, primarily due to growth on Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Army programs, as well as on international programs.

Intelligence and Information Systems
 
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) had third quarter 2007 net sales of $680 million, up 9 percent compared to $626 million in the third quarter 2006, primarily due to increased volume on several U.S. Air Force and information systems programs.

After the quarter close, the Company acquired Oakley Networks, a leading developer of cyber-security technology, which will add to Raytheon's capabilities in information operations/information assurance solutions.
 
Missile Systems
 
Missile Systems (MS) had third quarter 2007 net sales of $1,247 million, up 15 percent compared to $1,081 million in the third quarter 2006, primarily due to higher volume on the Standard Missile and Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) programs.

During the quarter, MS booked $223 million for the production of ESSM and $201 million for Standard Missile-2 (SM-2). MS also booked $117 million for the production of Javelin for the U.S. Army and U.S. Marines.
Network Centric Systems
 
Network Centric Systems (NCS) had third quarter 2007 net sales of $1,036 million, up 18 percent compared to $879 million in the third quarter 2006, primarily due to increased volume on certain U.S. Army programs.

Space and Airborne Systems
 
Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) had third quarter 2007 net sales of $1,016 million, down 5 percent compared to $1,069 million in the third quarter 2006, primarily due to lower volume on some airborne systems programs and a reduction in classified space bookings due to customer reprioritization. SAS recorded $121 million of operating income compared to $148 million in the third quarter 2006. Operating income was lower primarily due to profit adjustments taken on certain programs in both the third quarter 2006 and 2007 and reduced volume.
During the quarter, SAS booked over $123 million on a number of classified contracts.
Technical Services
 
 
Technical Services (TS) had third quarter 2007 net sales of $513 million compared to $500 million in the third quarter 2006. TS recorded operating income of $34 million in the third quarter 2007 compared to $35 million in the third quarter 2006.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Third Quarter 2007
We define ROIC as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the cumulative minimum pension liability/impact of FAS 158. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
