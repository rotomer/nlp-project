Approval of Performance Metrics for the 2008 Results-Based Incentive Program
 
On January 22, 2008, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Raytheon Company (the "Company"), approved the performance metrics for the Company's 2008 Results-Based Incentive Program (the "2008 RBI Program"). A summary of the Company's RBI Program was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 14, 2006, and is hereby incorporated by reference. The performance metrics, which are independent of each other and equally weighted, are as follows: free cash flow, return on invested capital, bookings, net sales and operating profit from continuing operations. These metrics and weightings are the same as those approved for the Company's 2007 RBI Program. The actual performance of the Company and its business segments, as measured against the pre-established performance metrics, will determine the overall funding level of the Company's 2008 RBI pool. The actual amount of incentive cash compensation paid to a participant will be based on such funding level and an assessment of the participant's individual performance in 2008.
 
Approval of Performance Metrics under the 2008-2010 Long-Term Performance Plan
 
The Committee also approved the three-year performance metrics for the Company's 2008-2010 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "2008-2010 LTPP"). A summary of the Company's LTPP was filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 14, 2006, and is incorporated herein by reference. The three-year performance metrics for the 2008-2010 LTPP, which are independent of each other, and the weighting for each of these metrics are as follows: return on invested capital (50%), cumulative free cash flow (25%) and total shareholder return relative to a peer group (25%). These metrics and weightings are the same as those approved for the Company's 2007-2009 LTPP.
