FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Raytheon Reports Strong Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Results; Increases 2008 Full-Year Guidance
 
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (January 31, 2008)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported fourth quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $634 million or $1.45 per diluted share compared to $344 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2006. Fourth quarter 2007 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to operational improvements, combined with lower net interest and pension expense as well as tax-related benefits of $214 million or $0.49 per diluted share.
,
 
"2007 was a very successful year for the Company; we grew sales 8% in 2007 while increasing operating income by 20%," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. "We ended the year with record bookings and backlog, which positions us well for 2008 and beyond."
Fourth quarter 2007 net income was $598 million or $1.37 per diluted share compared to $365 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2006. Net income for the fourth quarter 2007 included an after-tax loss of $36 million or $0.08 per diluted share in discontinued operations compared to income of $21 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2006. As previously disclosed, fourth quarter 2007 discontinued operations results included an after-tax charge of $44 million related to the sale of Flight Options LLC (FO), which was completed in the fourth quarter 2007. Fourth quarter 2006 discontinued operations included a full quarter of the results of FO and Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), which was sold in the second quarter 2007.
Net sales for the fourth quarter 2007 were $6.0 billion, up 8 percent from $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2006, with growth across all of the Company's businesses.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2007 was $941 million compared to $1,293 million for the fourth quarter 2006. This decrease is primarily due to the acceleration of a $500 million discretionary cash contribution originally planned to be made to the Company's pension plans in the first quarter 2008 and the timing of certain customer advances, partially offset by $381 million in tax refunds received during the quarter from the resolution of various tax matters.
Full-Year Financial Results
For the full year the Company reported income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion or $3.80 per diluted share compared to $1.2 billion or $2.63 per diluted share in 2006, primarily due to operational improvements combined with lower net interest and pension expense, and tax-related benefits. Full-year 2007 adjusted EPS from continuing
 
operations was $3.31.
(1)
In 2007 the Company sold Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) and Flight Options LLC (FO), which together contributed $885 million or $1.99 per diluted share (in discontinued operations) to net income. Net income for 2007 also included tax-related benefits of $219 million or $0.49 per diluted share. The Company reported net income for 2007 of $2.6 billion or $5.79 per diluted share compared to $1.3 billion or $2.85 per diluted share in 2006.
Total 2007 net sales for the Company were $21.3 billion compared to $19.7 billion for 2006, an increase of 8 percent, primarily due to Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS), Missile Systems (MS) and Network Centric Systems (NCS).
Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $1,249 million in 2007 compared to $2,477 million in 2006. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher cash tax payments and discretionary pension cash contributions made in 2007. The Company paid $1,115 million in cash taxes in 2007 ($631 million attributable to the gain on the sale of RAC) compared to $375 million in 2006. Also, the Company made $900 million in discretionary cash contributions to the Company's pension plans in 2007 compared to $200 million in 2006. The Company also received tax refunds of $381 million during the fourth quarter 2007.
As part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program, during the fourth quarter 2007 the Company repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for $341 million, and for the year repurchased 28.7 million shares for $1.6 billion.

Bookings and Backlog
 
The Company reported total bookings for the fourth quarter 2007 of $9.2 billion compared to $7.6 billion in the fourth quarter 2006, an increase driven primarily by two international multi-year programs, the Australian Air Warfare Destroyer program and the U.K.
e-Borders contract. The Company reported full-year 2007 bookings of $25.5 billion, up 14 percent compared to $22.4 billion for full-year 2006.
 
The Company ended 2007 with a record backlog of $36.6 billion, up 8 percent compared to $33.8 billion at the end of 2006.
Outlook

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Fourth Quarter 2007
We define Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the cumulative minimum pension liability/impact of FAS 158. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
