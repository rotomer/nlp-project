Raytheon Reports Strong First Quarter Results
 
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAM, Mass., (April 24, 2008)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported first quarter 2008 income from continuing operations of $400 million or $0.93 per diluted share compared to $324 million or $0.71 per diluted share in the first quarter 2007. First quarter 2008 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to increased volume, combined with lower net interest and pension expense.
"With the strong performance in the first quarter, the Company is off to a good start," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Our strong bookings, record backlog and solid operating performance demonstrate the Company is continuing to execute and is well positioned going forward."
First quarter 2008 net income was $398 million or $0.92 per diluted share compared to $346 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the first quarter 2007. Net income for the first quarter 2008 included an after-tax loss of $2 million or $0.01 per diluted share in discontinued operations compared to income of $22 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter 2007 primarily due to the results of Raytheon Aircraft Company, which was sold in the second quarter 2007.
 
Net sales for the first quarter 2008 were $5.4 billion, up 11 percent from $4.8 billion in the first quarter 2007.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter 2008 was a positive $67 million compared to an outflow of $353 million for the first quarter 2007. First quarter 2007 included a $400 million discretionary cash contribution made to the Company's pension plans.
In the first quarter 2008 the Company repurchased 5.5 million shares of common stock for $340 million, as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. In addition, as announced in March 2008, the Company's Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's annual dividend by 10 percent from $1.02 to $1.12 per share.

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
First Quarter 2008
We define Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the cumulative minimum pension liability/impact of FAS 158. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
