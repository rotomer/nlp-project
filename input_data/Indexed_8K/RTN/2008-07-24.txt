Raytheon Increases Full-year Guidance; Reports Strong Second Quarter 2008
 
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (July 24, 2008)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported second quarter 2008 income from continuing operations of $426 million or $1.00 per diluted share compared to $355 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the second quarter 2007. Second quarter 2008 income from continuing operations was higher primarily due to operational improvements and lower pension expense, as well as a prior-year $39 million charge ($59 million pretax) or $0.09 per diluted share for the early retirement of debt.
,
"All of our businesses performed well and the Company had a strong second quarter," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "We are increasing our financial outlook for the year as a result of our solid performance."
Second quarter 2008 net income was $426 million or $1.00 per diluted share compared to $1,335 million or $2.97 per diluted share in the second quarter 2007. Net income for the second quarter 2007 included $980 million in discontinued operations or $2.18 per diluted share primarily due to the sale of Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), which was completed in the second quarter 2007.
 
Net sales for the second quarter 2008 were $5.9 billion, up 11 percent from $5.3 billion in the second quarter 2007, with growth across all of the Company's businesses.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the second quarter 2008 was a positive $767 million compared to an outflow of $30 million for the second quarter 2007. The improvement in the second quarter 2008 was primarily due to cash tax payments of $316 million made in the second quarter 2007 attributable to the gain on the sale of RAC and a reduction in working capital items in the second quarter 2008.
In the second quarter 2008 the Company repurchased 5.2 million shares of common stock for $340 million, as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. The Company has repurchased 10.7 million shares of common stock year-to-date for $680 million.

The Company reported total bookings for the second quarter 2008 of $6.0 billion compared to $4.8 billion in the second quarter 2007. The Company ended the second quarter 2008 with a backlog of $37.5 billion compared to $36.6 billion at the end of 2007 and $33.3 billion at the end of the second quarter 2007.
Outlook
 
 
The Company has increased full-year 2008 guidance for net sales, earnings per share from continuing operations, operating cash flow from continuing operations and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), and updated net interest expense and diluted shares. Charts containing additional information on the Company's 2008 guidance are available on the Company's website at .

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Second Quarter 2008
We define Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
