Raytheon Reports Strong First Quarter Results; Increases Full-Year Guidance
 
WALTHAMMass., (April 23, 2009)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported first quarter 2009 income from continuing operations of $457 million or $1.11 per diluted share compared to $401 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the first quarter 2008.
,
"We delivered strong results across all of our businesses during the quarter," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Raytheon's strong domestic and international business and diverse portfolio of more than 8,000 programs position us well today and for the future."
Net sales for the first quarter 2009 were $5.9 billion, up 10 percent from $5.4 billion in the first quarter 2008, with growth across all of the Company's businesses.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter 2009 was $411 million compared to $67 million for the first quarter 2008. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a $337 million tax refund received in the first quarter 2009.

In the first quarter 2009 the Company repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock for $300 million, as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. In addition, as announced in March 2009, the Company's Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's annual dividend payout rate by 11 percent from $1.12 to $1.24 per share.

The impact to NCS in the first quarter 2009 is an increase of $8 million in operating income compared to an increase of $1 million in the first quarter 2008.
During the quarter, the Company changed the reporting of a U.K. manufacturing facility from Space and Airborne Systems to Missile Systems. Prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this reorganization.

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
First Quarter 2009
We define Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
