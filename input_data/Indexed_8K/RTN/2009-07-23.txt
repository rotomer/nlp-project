Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
WALTHAMMass., (July 23, 2009)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported second quarter 2009 income from continuing operations of $504 million, up 17 percent compared to $432 million in the second quarter 2008. EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter 2009 was $1.24, up 25 percent compared to $0.99 in the second quarter 2008.
,
"We are pleased with the Company's continued, solid performance and strong financial position," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "We are well positioned domestically and internationally on a broad base of programs which create long-term shareholder value."
Net sales for the second quarter 2009 were $6.1 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the second quarter 2008.
 
Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the second quarter 2009 was $512 million compared to $767 million for the second quarter 2008, primarily due to the timing of $395 million of cash contributions made to the Company's pension plans in the second quarter of 2009.
In the second quarter 2009 the Company repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $300 million, as part of the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. Year-to-date 2009, the Company repurchased 13.4 million shares of common stock for $600 million.
The Company ended the second quarter 2009 with $96 million of net debt. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.
 
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
The Company reported total bookings for the second quarter 2009 of $7.6 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the second quarter 2008. The Company ended the second quarter 2009 with a backlog of $37.3 billion compared to $38.9 billion at the end of 2008 and $37.5 billion at the end of the second quarter 2008. Due to a change in Missile Defense Agency priorities, on June 10, 2009 the Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) program was terminated for convenience, resulting in a $2.4 billion reduction of the Company's backlog at the end of the second quarter 2009. Bookings during the second quarter of 2009 largely offset the impact of the KEI program.
Outlook
 
 
The Company has increased full-year 2009 guidance for net sales, earnings per share from continuing operations and return on invested capital (ROIC). Charts containing additional information on the Company's 2009 guidance are available on the Company's website at . See attachment F for the Company's calculation and use of ROIC, a non-GAAP financial measure.

Segment Results
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had second quarter 2009 net sales of $1,335 million, up 6 percent compared to $1,257 million in the second quarter 2008, primarily due to growth on international Patriot programs. IDS recorded $205 million of operating income compared to $209 million in the second quarter 2008. As expected, the change in operating income was primarily due to contract mix, driven by the completion of certain programs in 2008.
During the quarter, IDS booked $877 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capability for several domestic and international customers, including the U.S. Army, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Taiwan and Kuwait. IDS also booked $157 million to provide Finland with Surface Launched Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SL-AMRAAM) systems, $150 million for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor Systems (JLENS) for the U.S. Army, and $142 million for two Volume Search Radar (VSR) arrays for the U.S. Navy, one for the Zumwalt-class destroyer program and one for the CVN 78 aircraft carrier.
 
Intelligence and Information Systems
 
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) had second quarter 2009 net sales of $812 million compared to $829 million in the second quarter 2008.

During the quarter, IIS booked $342 million on a number of classified contracts.

During the quarter, MS booked $521 million for the production of Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) for the U.S. Air Force and international customers and $260 million for Phalanx Weapon Systems for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army.

Space and Airborne Systems
 
Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) had second quarter 2009 net sales of $1,136 million, up 6 percent compared to $1,072 million in the second quarter 2008, primarily due to growth on international airborne tactical radar programs and classified business.

TS recorded $53 million of operating income compared to $45 million in the second quarter 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher volume.

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Second Quarter 2009
We define Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
