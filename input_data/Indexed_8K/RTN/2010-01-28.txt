WALTHAM, Mass., (January 28, 2010)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) reported fourth quarter 2009 income from continuing operations of $517 million, up 21 percent compared to $428 million in the fourth quarter 2008. EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.30, up 29 percent compared to $1.01 in the fourth quarter 2008. Fourth quarter 2008 income from continuing operations included a $45 million ($69 million pretax) unfavorable adjustment due to the impact of pension investment returns on existing contracts in 2008.
"Our 2009 results reflect the increasing global demand for our capabilities, as well as the Company's strong operational performance," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Looking ahead, we expect continued growth by providing our customers with innovative solutions that address their evolving needs."
 
Net sales in the fourth quarter 2009 were $6.7 billion, up 10 percent from $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2008.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2009 was $1,073 million compared to $444 million in the fourth quarter 2008. In the fourth quarter 2008 the Company made $660 million in discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans. The Company made $1,115 million in total cash contributions to its pension plans in full-year 2009 compared to $1,174 million in full-year 2008.
In the fourth quarter 2009 the Company repurchased 6.0 million shares of common stock for $300 million, as part of its previously announced share repurchase program. For the full-year 2009 the Company repurchased 25.8 million shares of common stock for $1.2 billion.

Net sales in 2009 were $24.9 billion, up 7 percent from $23.2 billion in 2008, with all of Raytheon's businesses contributing to the sales growth.
The Company generated strong operating cash flow for the year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.7 billion in 2009 compared to $2.0 billion in 2008. The increase in operating cash flow in 2009 was primarily due to improved performance and lower net cash tax payments.

The Company paid $545 million in cash taxes in 2008 and received $97 million in tax refunds and credits.
The Company ended 2009 in a net cash position of $313 million ($2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents less total debt of $2.3 billion).

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Fourth Quarter 2009
We define Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations excluding the after-tax affect of the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the impact of the accounting standard for employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
