Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
First Quarter 2010
The Company defines Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as income from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effect of the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the impact of the accounting standard for employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of its use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
