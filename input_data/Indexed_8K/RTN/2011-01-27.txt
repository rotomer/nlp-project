WALTHAM, Mass., (January 27, 2011)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) announced fourth quarter 2010 Adjusted EPS of $1.57 per diluted share compared to $1.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2009
(1)
, up 20 percent. The increase was primarily driven by operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Fourth quarter 2010 EPS from continuing operations was $1.37 compared to $1.30 in the fourth quarter 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 and fourth quarter 2009 EPS from continuing operations included net charges of $0.10 and $0.03, respectively, associated with the impacts of the early debt retirements. Fourth quarter 2010 also included FAS/CAS pension expense of $0.11, compared to $0.01 of FAS/CAS pension income in the fourth quarter 2009.
 
 
"Raytheon's focus on performance drove solid operating results," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "The depth and breadth of our product portfolio coupled with outstanding execution positions the company well going forward."
Net sales in the fourth quarter 2010 were $6.9 billion compared to $6.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2009.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2010 was $861 million after a $750 million discretionary cash contribution made to the Company's pension plans, compared to $1,073 million in the fourth quarter 2009. The strong operating cash flow from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2010 was primarily due to the timing of collections and lower cash taxes.
In the fourth quarter 2010, the Company repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million, as part of its previously announced share repurchase program. For the full-year 2010 the Company repurchased 29.0 million shares of common stock for $1,450 million.
As previously announced, in the fourth quarter 2010, the Company issued $2.0 billion in long-term debt and retired $678 million in long-term debt maturing in 2012 and 2013. As a result of the debt retirement and issuance of longer maturities, the Company extended the term of its debt structure at lower interest rates.
Also as previously announced, in the fourth quarter 2010, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Applied Signal Technology, Inc. (AST) and commenced a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of AST. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter 2011 and AST will become part of Raytheon's Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) business.

In addition to the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 Adjusted Income exclude the impact of the charges associated with the make-whole provision on the early retirement of debt and the impact of the acceleration of deferred gains related to terminated interest rate swaps on retired debt.

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Fourth Quarter 2010
Revised ROIC Calculation
Our revised definition of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is the same as our prior definition except stockholders' equity is now adjusted to add back the Company's liability for defined benefit pension plans, net of tax, instead of just the impact of the accounting standard for employers' accounting for defined benefit pension plans. We adjusted the ROIC definition to exclude any change from pension contributions, which eliminates all of the non-operational pension impact from the calculation in order to more clearly reflect the underlying business performance in ROIC. We define ROIC as income from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effect of the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment and, from time to time, certain other items, plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the liability for defined benefit pension plans, net of tax. 2009 ROIC also excludes from income from continuing operations the after-tax effect of the fourth quarter 2009 charge associated with the make-whole provision on the early retirement of debt and 2010 ROIC also excludes from income from continuing operations the after-tax effect of the second quarter 2010 UK Border Agency program adjustment, the third quarter 2010 favorable tax settlement and the after-tax effect of the fourth quarter 2010 charge associated with the make-whole provision on the early retirement of debt. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC as a measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of capital and as an element of management compensation.

Our prior definition of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) was income from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effect of the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the impact of the accounting standard for employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. 2009 ROIC also excludes from income from continuing operations the after-tax effect of the fourth quarter 2009 charge associated with the make-whole provision on the early retirement of debt and 2010 ROIC also excludes from income from continuing operations the after-tax effect of the second quarter 2010 UK Border Agency program adjustment, the third quarter 2010 favorable tax settlement and the after-tax effect of the fourth quarter 2010 charge associated with the make-whole provision on the early retirement of debt.
