FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Raytheon Reports Solid First Quarter Results
 
 
 
 
WALTHAM, Mass., (April 28, 2011)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) announced first quarter 2011 Adjusted EPS of $1.38 per diluted share compared to $1.25 per diluted share in the first quarter 2010
(1)
, up 10 percent.
"I am very pleased with the Company's solid performance in the quarter, particularly given the challenging budget environment," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Our continued focus on cost efficiencies and program performance is reflected in the year-over-year improvements in our operating results."
First quarter 2011 EPS from continuing operations was $1.06 compared to $1.18 in the first quarter 2010. First quarter 2011 included an unfavorable FAS/CAS Adjustment
(1)
of $0.16, compared to $0.07 in the first quarter 2010. In connection with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) program, first quarter 2011 also included an $80 million pretax ($56 million after-tax) or $0.16 per diluted share unfavorable adjustment. This adjustment is based on the UKBA's decision to draw down on the previously disclosed letters of credit (UKBA LOC Adjustment) provided by Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL). The determination of the validity of the drawdown is now subject to the ongoing arbitration proceedings related to the UKBA program.
 
 
Net sales were $6.1 billion in both the first quarter 2011 and the first quarter 2010. First quarter 2011 was affected by the duration of the continuing resolution.
First quarter 2011 operating cash flow from continuing operations of $69 million was better than expected, driven by improved cash collections. First quarter 2010 operating cash flow from continuing operations was $257 million. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a financial systems implementation at Technical Services, which impacted the timing of customer billings.
In the first quarter 2011, the Company repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock for $312 million, as part of its previously announced share repurchase program. In addition, as announced in March 2011, the Company's Board of Directors voted to increase the Company's annual dividend rate by 15 percent from $1.50 to $1.72 per share, the seventh consecutive annual dividend increase.
Also as previously announced, in the first quarter 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Applied Signal Technology, Inc., which has become part of Raytheon's Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) business.
The Company ended the first quarter 2011 with $951 million of net debt. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.

Segment Results
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had first quarter 2011 net sales of $1,219 million compared to $1,336 million in the first quarter 2010. As expected, the change in net sales was primarily due to lower sales on a U.S. Navy program. IDS recorded $193 million of operating income compared to $208 million in the first quarter 2010, driven by the change in volume.
During the quarter, IDS booked $131 million to provide engineering services support for a Patriot air and missile defense program for U.S. and international customers. IDS also booked $107 million for development on the competitively awarded Space Fence program for the U.S. Air Force.
Intelligence and Information Systems
 
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) had first quarter 2011 net sales of $750 million compared to $730 million in the first quarter 2010. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales on Global Positioning System Operational Control Segment (GPS-OCX). IIS operating income in the first quarter 2011 was reduced by $80 million or a 10.6 percent margin impact due to the UKBA LOC Adjustment.

Missile Systems
 
Missile Systems (MS) had first quarter 2011 net sales of $1,329 million compared to $1,361 million in the first quarter 2010.

During the quarter, MS booked $375 million for the development and production of Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) for the Missile Defense Agency. MS also booked $177 million for the production of Excalibur for the U.S. Army and an international customer.

Network Centric Systems (NCS) had first quarter 2011 net sales of $1,121 million compared to $1,176 million in the first quarter 2010.

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
First Quarter 2011
As previously reported in the Company's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, beginning in 2011, in order to more clearly show each business' underlying operational performance, we began treating for management reporting purposes the difference between our postretirement benefits (PRB) expense or income under FAS and our PRB expense under CAS (FAS/CAS PRB Adjustment) consistent with the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment. The FAS/CAS Adjustment, as shown below, represents the combination of the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment and FAS/CAS PRB Adjustment. This Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure has been prepared to reflect this change.
We define ROIC as income from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effect of the FAS/CAS Adjustment and, from time to time, certain other items, plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the liability for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, net of tax. 2011 ROIC also excludes from income from continuing operations the $58 million after-tax effect of the UKBA LOC Adjustment. This adjustment is based on the UKBA's decision to draw down on the previously disclosed letters of credit provided by Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL). The determination of the validity of the drawdown is now a subject of the ongoing arbitration proceedings related to the UKBA program. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC as a measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
