This current report on Form 8-K/A (this Amendment) amends a current report on Form 8-K, filed June 1, 2011 (the Original Filing), in which Raytheon Company (the Company) reported voting results for its
Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 26, 2011 (the 2011 Annual Meeting), including the voting results for both the Companys non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of its named executive officers (the Say-on-Pay Vote) and the Companys non-binding stockholder advisory vote regarding the frequency of future Say-on-Pay Votes (the Frequency Vote). Except for the foregoing, this Amendment does not modify or update any other disclosure contained in the Original Filing.
 
 
Item 5.07   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As previously reported in the Original Filing, more than a majority of shares voting at the 2011 Annual Meeting voted, on a non-binding advisory basis, in favor of an annual frequency for future Say-on-Pay Votes in accord with the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors (theBoard).
 
On July 27, 2011, the Board determined that the Company will hold future Say-on-Pay Votes on an annual basis until the next Frequency Vote is conducted which shall occur no later than the Companys annual meeting in 2017.
