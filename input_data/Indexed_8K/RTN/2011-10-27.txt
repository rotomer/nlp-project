WALTHAM, Mass., (October 27, 2011)  Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) announced third quarter 2011 Adjusted EPS of $1.39 per diluted share compared to $1.35 per diluted share in the third quarter 2010

.
"Our continued focus on delivering affordable and innovative solutions to our customers is highlighted by robust third quarter bookings," said William H. Swanson, Raytheon's Chairman and CEO. "Solid execution and cost reduction efforts drove strong operating margin and cash flow performance in the quarter."
Third quarter 2011 EPS from continuing operations was $1.43 compared to $1.71 in the third quarter 2010, a difference of $0.28. The change was primarily due to the net change of $0.28 per diluted share in tax settlements year-over-year. Third quarter 2011 included a favorable tax settlement of $60 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to a favorable tax settlement of $170 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the third quarter 2010. Third quarter 2011 also included an unfavorable FAS/CAS Adjustment
(1)
of $0.14, compared to an unfavorable FAS/CAS Adjustment
(1)
of $0.09 in the third quarter 2010.
 
 
Net sales for the third quarter 2011 were $6,132 million, compared to $6,272 million in the third quarter 2010. The Company reported strong bookings for the third quarter 2011 of $6,884 million compared to $6,038 million in the third quarter 2010, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12.
The Company generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter 2011 was $859 million compared to $413 million for the third quarter 2010. The increase in operating cash flow from continuing operations in the third quarter 2011 was primarily due to the timing of payroll periods, a tax refund and reductions in working capital.
In the third quarter 2011, the Company repurchased 7.6 million shares of common stock for $312 million as part of its previously announced share repurchase program. Year-to-date 2011, the Company repurchased 20.1 million shares of common stock for $937 million. Also, as previously announced in September 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock.
On October 17, 2011, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the Company's senior unsecured credit rating from Baa1 to A3, reflecting the Company's strong financial position. The Company ended the third quarter 2011 with $1.2 billion of net debt. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents.
 
 
 
Bookings and Backlog
 
The Company ended the third quarter 2011 with a backlog of $35.0 billion, compared to $34.6 billion at the end of 2010.

Segment Results
Integrated Defense Systems
 
Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had third quarter 2011 net sales of $1,176 million compared to $1,319 million in the third quarter 2010. As expected, the change in net sales was primarily due to lower sales on an international Patriot program and a U.S. Navy program. IDS recorded $204 million of operating income compared to $206 million in the third quarter 2010. The change in operating income was primarily due to the change in volume partially offset by improved program performance and favorable contract mix.
During the quarter, IDS booked $142 million for the production of Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS) systems and spares for the U.S. Navy. IDS also booked $93 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capability for an international customer.
Intelligence and Information Systems
 
NM = Not Meaningful
Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) had third quarter 2011 net sales of $760 million compared to $735 million in the third quarter 2010.

The change in net sales was primarily due to lower sales on U.S. Army programs. NCS recorded $162 million of operating income compared to $169 million in the third quarter 2010. The change in operating income was primarily due to lower volume partially offset by improved program performance and favorable contract mix.
NCS booked $187 million for the production of Sentinel radars, spares, and services for the U.S. Army and international customers.

Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) had third quarter 2011 net sales of $1,305 million, up 5 percent compared to $1,238 million in the third quarter 2010.

SAS recorded $171 million of operating income compared to $188 million in the third quarter 2010. Third quarter 2011 operating income was reduced by $8 million of acquisition-related costs and $14 million related to a contract modification.
During the quarter, SAS booked $78 million on radar contracts for an international customer. SAS also booked $468 million on a number of classified contracts.
Technical Services
 
 
Technical Services (TS) had third quarter 2011 net sales of $817 million compared to $873 million in the third quarter 2010.

Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Third Quarter 2011
We define ROIC as income from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effect of the FAS/CAS Adjustment and, from time to time, certain other items, plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the liability for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, net of tax. 2011 ROIC also excludes from income from continuing operations the $60 million after-tax effect of the UKBA LOC Adjustment, as previously disclosed, and the $60 million impact of the third quarter of 2011 favorable tax settlement. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC as a measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
