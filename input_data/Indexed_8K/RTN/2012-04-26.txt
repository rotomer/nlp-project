Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure
First Quarter 2012
As previously disclosed in the Company's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the first quarter of 2012 we completed the disposal or abandonment of the remaining individual assets of our former turbo-prop commuter aircraft portfolio, Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC (RAAS), and all operations have ceased. As a result of the sale of the remaining operating assets, we have reported RAAS as a discontinued operation. This Preliminary Return on Invested Capital Non-GAAP Financial Measure has been prepared to reflect the reclassification of RAAS as a discontinued operation.
We define ROIC as income from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effect of the FAS/CAS Adjustment and, from time to time, certain other items, plus after-tax net interest expense plus one-third of operating lease expense after-tax (estimate of interest portion of operating lease expense) divided by average invested capital after capitalizing operating leases (operating lease expense times a multiplier of 8), adding financial guarantees less net investment in Discontinued Operations, and adding back the liability for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, net of tax. 2011 ROIC also excludes from income from continuing operations the $60 million after-tax effect of the UKBA LOC Adjustment and the $60 million impact of the favorable tax settlement, both as previously disclosed. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROIC should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses ROIC as a measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of capital and as an element of management compensation.
