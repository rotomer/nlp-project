Third Quarter 2012
Results
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
WALTHAM, Mass., (October 25, 2012) - Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) announced
third quarter 2012
Adjusted EPS
1
of
$1.60
per diluted share compared to
$1.39
per diluted share in the
third quarter 2011
,
up
15
percent. The increase was primarily driven by operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
Third quarter 2012
EPS from continuing operations was
$1.51
compared to
$1.42
in the
third quarter 2011
.
Third quarter 2012
included an unfavorable FAS/CAS Adjustment of
$0.09
, compared with an unfavorable FAS/CAS Adjustment of
$0.14
in the
third quarter 2011
. Third quarter 2011 also included a $0.17 per diluted share favorable tax settlement.
Raytheon's strong operating performance in the third quarter reflects our continued focus on reducing cost, and increasing productivity, said William H. Swanson, Raytheons Chairman and CEO. Our bookings in the quarter were strong, and we have significant opportunities in both domestic and international markets for our innovative technologies and affordable solutions.

Adjusted EPS is EPS from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders and Adjusted Operating Margin is total operating margin, in each case, excluding the impact of the FAS/CAS Adjustment, and from time to time, certain other items. Q3 2011 Adjusted EPS also excludes the impact of the favorable tax settlement as discussed above. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See attachment F for a reconciliation of these measures and a discussion of why the Company is presenting this information.

Net sales for the
third quarter 2012
were
$6,045 million
, compared to
$6,116 million
in the
third quarter 2011
. The Company reported strong bookings for the third quarter 2012 of $7,293 million, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.21. Bookings in the third quarter 2011 were $6,884 million.
The Company generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the
third quarter 2012
was
$1,111 million
compared to
$845 million
for the
third quarter 2011
. The increase in operating cash from continuing operations in the third quarter 2012 was primarily due to the timing of collections and pension contributions, partially offset by higher tax payments.
In the
third quarter 2012
, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $125 million as part of its previously announced share repurchase program. Year-to-date 2012, the Company repurchased 14.1 million shares of common stock for $725 million.
The Company ended the
third quarter 2012
with
$1.0 billion
of net debt. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Bookings and Backlog
The Company had bookings of
$7.3 billion
in the
third quarter 2012

Outlook
The Company has updated its full-year 2012 outlook. Charts containing additional information on the Company's 2012 outlook are available on the Company's website at
www.raytheon.com/ir
.
Although it remains uncertain if sequestration under the Budget Control Act (BCA) will be implemented, sequestration could have a significant impact on the U.S. Military, the Aerospace and Defense Industry and Federal spending. Several industry associations estimate that sequestration, if implemented, could have a severe impact on U.S. Aerospace and Defense Industry employment nationwide. We believe that Raytheon's large international market presence, portfolio of programs, technology and focus on high priority areas should help to mitigate some of the potential overall impact.
