Item 5. Other Events Sprint Corporation (Sprint) adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January 1, 2002. This standard prescribes the accounting treatment for both identifiable intangibles and goodwill after initial recognition. Upon adoption of the standard, amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles ceased and accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2001 reduced the carrying value of these assets. Periodic impairment testing of these assets is now required. Definite life intangibles continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Sprint identified spectrum licenses, which include related microwave relocation costs, and its trademark as indefinite life intangibles. Concurrent with adoption, Sprint evaluated for impairment its goodwill and indefinite life intangibles in accordance with the standard's guidance and determined these assets were not impaired. The following pro forma table adjusts net income (loss) and basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share in 2001, 2000 and 1999 to exclude amortization, net of any related tax effects on goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
