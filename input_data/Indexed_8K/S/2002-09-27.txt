STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of September 21, 2002 (this "Agreement"), is made and entered into by and between Sprint Corporation, a Kansas corporation ("Sprint"), Centel Directories LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Centel LLC") ( Sprint and Centel LLC are collectively referred to in this Agreement as "Sellers"), and R.H. Donnelley Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"). RECITALS 1. Sprint owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the "DAI Shares") of DirectoriesAmerica, Inc., a Kansas corporation ("DAI"), which owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sprint Publishing & Advertising, Inc., a Kansas corporation ("SPA"). 2. Centel LLC owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the "CDC Shares" and, collectively with the DAI Shares, the "Shares") of Centel Directory Company, a Delaware corporation ("CDC"), which owns a membership interest in Cendon, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("Cendon") (DAI, SPA and CDC are hereinafter each referred to as a "Wholly Owned Company" and collectively referred to as the "Wholly Owned Companies", and DAI, SPA, CDC and Cendon are hereinafter each referred to as a "Company" and collectively referred to as the "Companies"). 3. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from Sellers, the Shares. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE I PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the closing provided for in Section 1.5 of this Agreement (the "Closing"), Sellers agree to sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase, acquire and accept from Sellers, the Shares. Section 1.2 Payment of Purchase Price. (a) In consideration for the sale, transfer and delivery of the Shares, at the Closing Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Sellers (or to such third parties as may be designated in writing by Sellers) the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1.2(d). The "Estimated Purchase Price" payable at Closing shall equal (i) Two Billion Two Hundred Thirty Million Dollars ($2,230,000,000) and (ii) (A) plus an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and the Target Working Capital if the amount of Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, or (B) less an amount equal to the difference between the Target Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital if the amount of Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital. (b) At least five business days prior to the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer an estimated combined consolidated balance sheet of the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles (as hereinafter defined) and a certificate setting forth the Estimated Working Capital based on such balance sheet. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Estimated Working Capital" shall mean the good faith, best estimate of Sellers of the book value of the Current Assets (as defined in Section 1.3) of the Companies less the book value of the Current Liabilities (as defined in -2-
Section 1.3) of the Companies as of the of business on the Closing Date as reflected on such balance sheet. (c) Within five business days after the determination of the Final Balance Sheet (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with Section 1.4 of this Agreement, (i) if the amount of the Closing Date Working Capital calculated in accordance with Section 1.4 is less than the Estimated Working Capital, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital plus interest or (ii) if the amount of the Closing Date Working Capital calculated in accordance with Section 1.4 is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the difference between the Closing Date Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital, plus interest. Any interest on such payments shall be calculated using the prime rate of interest (as published in the "Money Rates" table of the Eastern U.S. Edition of The Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date) and shall begin on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) and end on the date of any such payment. (d) All payments required under this Section 1.2 shall be made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds to such bank account(s) as shall be designated in writing by the recipient at least three business days prior to the Closing or promptly upon the determination of the Final Balance Sheet, as the case may be. The net amount of all payments received by Sellers under this Section 1.2 is referred to in this Agreement as the "Purchase Price." -3-
Section 1.3 Target Working Capital. "Target Working Capital" shall equal $259,548,000, which represents the book value of categories of current assets of the Companies listed on 1.3 (the "Current Assets") less the book value of those categories of current liabilities of the Companies listed on Schedule 1.3 (the "Current Liabilities"), in each case as reflected on the audited combined consolidated balance sheet of the Companies as of December 31, 2001 (the "Year-End Balance Sheet"). Section 1.4 Adjustment of Purchase Price. (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Closing Date Working Capital" shall mean the book value of the Current Assets less the book value of the Current Liabilities as reflected on the Final Balance Sheet. Closing Date Working Capital shall not include deferred directory costs, deferred revenue, any asset or liability related to Taxes or any intercompany accounts settled pursuant to Section 5.22. (b) Promptly following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare a combined consolidated balance sheet of the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Balance Sheet"), in accordance with the Accounting Principles. "Accounting Principles" means generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") on a basis consistent with the Year-End Balance Sheet and using the same policies and procedures as were used to prepare the Year-End Balance Sheet. Buyer shall engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "Buyer's Auditor") to conduct an audit of the Preliminary Balance Sheet. Buyer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Sellers a final draft of the Preliminary Balance Sheet within 90 days after the Closing Date, together with the opinion of the Buyer's Auditor thereon stating that the audit has been conducted in accordance with the Accounting Principles. Representatives of Sellers shall have the opportunity to examine the work papers, schedules and -4-
other documents prepared by Buyer in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Balance Sheet. Buyer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer's Auditor to permit Sellers and their accounting firm (the "Sellers' Auditor") to examine the Buyer's Auditor's work papers used in connection with its audit of the Preliminary Balance Sheet. Buyer shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Buyer Auditor, and Sellers shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Sellers' Auditor. (c) If Sellers object to the Preliminary Balance Sheet, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a written notice of objection (an "Objection Notice") within thirty (30) days following the delivery thereof. If Sellers have no objection to the Preliminary Balance Sheet, Sellers shall promptly deliver to Buyer a written notice of acceptance (an "Acceptance Notice"). The Preliminary Balance Sheet shall be final and binding on the parties if an Acceptance Notice is delivered or if no Objection Notice is delivered to Buyer within such 30-day period. Any payment or portion of any payment required under Section 1.2 not subject to the Objection Notice, shall be paid within five business days following the delivery of the Objection Notice. Any Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the disputed items on the Preliminary Balance Sheet and shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for the objection and all information in the possession of Sellers which forms the basis of the objection, as well as the amount in dispute. If an Objection Notice is given, the parties shall consult with each other with respect to the objection. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after an Objection Notice has been given, any unresolved disputed items shall be promptly referred to KPMG; provided, however, that if KPMG declines to accept such appointment then the parties shall mutually agree upon another nationally recognized independent accounting firm that has not provided material services to either party during the previous two years (the "Unrelated -5-
Accounting Firm"). The Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be directed to resolve disputed issues in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and render a written report on the unresolved disputed issues with respect to the Preliminary Balance Sheet as promptly as practicable and to resolve only those issues of dispute set forth in the Objection Notice. The resolution of the dispute by the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The Preliminary Balance Sheet as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.4(c) is referred to in this Agreement as the "Final Balance Sheet". Section 1.5 Closing. The Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place on the later to occur of (a) January 3, 2003 and (b) the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement that are capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing Date, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of King & Spalding, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, or on such other date and at such other time or place as the parties may agree. However, if the prior sentence would require the Closing to occur prior to January 30, 2003, Buyer may elect to defer the Closing to a date on or prior to January 30, 2003. The date of the Closing is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date." Section 1.6 Deliveries by Sellers. At the Closing, Sellers will deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (unless delivered previously) the following: (a) The stock certificates representing all of the Shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank; -6-
(b) The resignations of all officers and members of the Boards of Directors of the Wholly Owned Companies and the managers of Cendon, in each case from their position as such, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; (c) The Transition Services Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the Directory Services License Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the Mutual Release (as hereinafter defined), the Non-Competition Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the Subscriber Listings Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the Trademark License Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the Publisher Trademark License Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and the SPV Agreement (as hereinafter defined), each executed by Sprint and/or the applicable subsidiary of Sprint (the "Ancillary Agreements"); and (d) All other documents, instruments and writings reasonably required by Buyer to be delivered by Sellers at or prior to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise reasonably required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 1.7 Deliveries by Buyer. At the Closing, Buyer will deliver or cause to be delivered to Sellers (unless previously delivered) the following: (a) The Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1.2(a) of this Agreement; (b) The Ancillary Agreements, each executed by Buyer or the Companies, as applicable; and (c) All other documents, instruments and writings reasonably required by Sellers to be delivered by the Buyer at or prior to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement or -7-
otherwise reasonably required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 1.8 Initial and Second Closing. (a) In the event that (i) at any time after the date hereof the only conditions to Closing capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing Date that have not been satisfied are Section 6.1(d) and/or Section 6.2(d) as a result of an action or, with respect to Section 6.1(d), failure to act by one or more state public utilities commissions or other state governmental or regulatory authorities and (ii) the directories published by the Companies in the state or states with respect to which such regulatory action has occurred or, with respect to Section 6.1(d), has failed to occur (the "Excluded States") represent less than eight percent (8%) of the 2001 revenues of the Companies, as set forth on Schedule 1.8(a) (the inclusion in this Section 1.8 of this percentage is not deemed to be an admission or representation by any party that this percentage of revenues is or is not "material" or would or could have a "material adverse effect" as contemplated by this Agreement), the parties will complete an initial Closing (the "Initial Closing") in accordance with this Agreement (including this Section 1.8) on the later to occur of (i) January 3, 2003, and (ii) the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement that are capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing Date (other than Sections 6.1(d) and 6.2(d)). However, if the prior sentence would require the Initial Closing to occur prior to January 30, 2003, Buyer may elect to defer the Initial Closing to a date on or prior to January 30, 2003. (b) Immediately prior to the Initial Closing, (i) the Companies will contribute to one or more newly formed corporate or limited liability company subsidiaries (each, a "State Subsidiary") those assets listed on Schedule 1.8(b) relating to the directories -8-
publishing business conducted by the Companies in each Excluded State as of the date of the Initial Closing (the "Excluded Business"), (ii) each State Subsidiary will assume the liabilities listed on Schedule 1.8(b) relating to the Excluded Business in its respective Excluded State, and (iii) all of the common stock or membership interests of the State Subsidiary will be distributed to DAI or Centel LLC, as applicable, pursuant to Sections 332 and 337 of the Code and thereafter, prior to the Second Closing Termination Date, Sellers will not take any action that would cause Centel LLC or DAI to no longer be part of their consolidated group for federal tax purposes. The respective assets and liabilities relating to the Excluded Business conducted in each Excluded State will be contributed to and assumed by a separate State Subsidiary. If required, the Parties will cause CenDon to make a non-cash, non-liquidating distribution of the common stock or membership interest of the State Subsidiary to CDC. (c) In the event that following the Initial Closing and prior to the termination of this Agreement, the conditions to closing set forth in Section 6.1(d) and Section 6.2(d) become satisfied (or waived) as to one or more Excluded States, the parties will complete a subsequent Closing (the "Second Closing") at which Sellers will sell to Buyer the shares or membership interests (as applicable) of the applicable State Subsidiary(ies) as to which the conditions in Section 6.1(d) and Section 6.2(d) have been satisfied (or waived). The Second Closing will take place on such date as is agreed to by the parties but in no event later than the business day prior to the one year anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "Second Closing Termination Date"), assuming that all conditions to Closing have been satisfied as of such date (other than Section 6.1(d) or 6.2(d) with respect to any states that are not included in the Initial Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conditions to the Closing in Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.2(d) have not been satisfied at the Initial Closing as to more than one -9-
Excluded State, the Second Closing will occur within five business days of the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement that are capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing Date, including without limitation Sections 6.1(d) and 6.2(d), as to each of the Excluded States; provided, however, that if, on the Second Closing Termination Date, the conditions in Sections 6.1(d) and 6.2(d) have not been satisfied as to any Excluded State, such Excluded State will not be the subject of a Second Closing. (d) For the purposes of the Initial Closing and the Second Closing, (i) the dollar amount indicated in the second sentence of Section 1.2(a) shall equal $2,230,000,000 times the Applicable Fraction (as defined below) and (ii) the Target Working Capital shall equal $259,548,000 times the Applicable Fraction. The "Applicable Fraction" means a fraction, the numerator of which is the revenues reflected on Schedule 1.8(a) for the states with respect to which the business is being transferred at the Initial Closing or Second Closing (as applicable) and the denominator of which is the total revenues reflected on Schedule 1.8(a). (e) At the Initial Closing, the DAI Shares will be retained by Sprint, and Buyer will purchase the CDC Shares and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SPA (which, together with the CDC Shares, will constitute the "Shares" for purposes of the Initial Closing). Prior to the Initial Closing, the parties will enter into an amendment to this Agreement that reflects the provisions of this Section 1.8 and otherwise causes the economic and legal substance of this Agreement to be retained and implemented with respect to the Initial Closing and the Second Closing, including without limitation to (i) remove DAI from the definition of "Companies" and include DAI in the definition of "Sellers", (ii) deem the State Subsidiaries to be "Companies" and "Wholly Owned Companies" for purposes of this Agreement and (iii) deem the word "Closing" to include the Second Closing. Notwithstanding -10-
the foregoing, at the Initial Closing, the provisions of Section 5.14 and Section 5.7 will apply without amendment except as set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. Following the Initial Closing, this Agreement as so amended will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. (f) After the Initial Closing, the Companies will manage and operate the Excluded Business on behalf of Sellers pursuant to the Services Agreement (as defined below), including (without limitation) by performing national and local sales, billing, credit and collection, customer service, pre-press, printing and distribution. All gross revenues of the Excluded Business will be collected by the Companies on behalf of Sellers and promptly transferred to Sellers. For each Excluded State (for so long as such Excluded State is subject to the Services Agreement), Sellers will pay the Companies a fee for the performance of such services for each fiscal year equal to 39% of the net billed revenue of the Excluded Business in the Excluded State for such fiscal year plus 110% of direct costs for printing, paper procurement and distribution for such Excluded Business for such fiscal year. The fee shall be prorated on a daily basis for any partial year during which the Services Agreement is in effect with respect to the Excluded Business in the applicable Excluded State. In connection with the Initial Closing, Sellers and the Companies will enter into a 50-year services agreement (the "Services Agreement") with respect to the Excluded Businesses to implement and reflect the provision of services and payment of fees for performance described in this Section 1.8(f) and otherwise containing substantially the same terms and conditions as are contained in the Directory Services License Agreement. The Services Agreement will terminate upon the Second Closing as to any Excluded Business acquired by Buyer in the Second Closing. -11-
(g) If, at any time following the Second Closing Termination Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms following the Initial Closing, Sellers determine to sell any of the State Subsidiary(ies) or all or any portion of the Excluded Business that has not been the subject of a Second Closing, Sellers will give notice to the Companies of such intent and request the Companies to submit a written proposal to Sellers outlining the specific terms and conditions under which the Companies are willing to purchase such State Subsidiary(ies) or the applicable portion of the Excluded Business (the "Target Assets"), which the Companies will submit within thirty (30) days following Sellers' request if the Company desires to pursue such opportunity. If the Companies do not submit a proposal within such 30-day period, Sellers may contract with a third party in Sellers' discretion to purchase the Target Assets. If the Companies submit a proposal during such 30-day period, Sellers will negotiate in good faith with the Companies for a period of thirty (30) days following the receipt by Sellers of such proposal to agree on terms and conditions under which the Companies would acquire the Target Assets. If no agreement has been reached by the end of the 30-day period, Sellers will submit a final written proposal to the Companies, who will have five business days to accept such proposal. If Sellers and the Companies are unable to agree on terms for the Companies to acquire the Target Assets within the time frame specified in this Section, Sellers may contract with a third party to acquire the Target Assets on terms which in the aggregate are no more favorable to the purchaser than last offered in writing to the Companies. If Sellers contract with a third party to acquire the Target Assets, the Services Agreement will terminate with respect to the Target Assets upon 60 days prior written notice to the Companies, in which event Sellers will be required to pay the unpaid fees accrued under the Services Agreement with respect to the Target Assets and reimburse the Companies for any amounts -12-
payable under the Buyer's generally applicable severance plans with respect to employees that the Companies decide to terminate as a result of the termination of the Services Agreement with respect to the Target Assets; provided that the Companies will cooperate in good faith to permit the purchaser of the Target Assets to employ any of such employees. (h) In connection with the Initial Closing and the Second Closing, the definition of "Service Areas" in the Directory Services License Agreement will be revised to exclude the Services Areas in which the Excluded Business that has not been included in a Second Closing is conducted. (i) It is the intent of the parties that this Section 1.8 constitute a binding and enforceable agreement to proceed with the Initial Closing and the Second Closing in the circumstances described in Sections 1.8(a) and 1.8(c). The parties agree to use their good faith, reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on forms of amendments to this Agreement as contemplated by this Section 1.8 and each of the Ancillary Agreements and to enter into the Services Agreement, in each case as may be necessary to effect the Initial Closing and the Second Closing on the terms described in this Section 1.8. However, if the parties are unable to agree on any of the terms of such agreements, all issue(s) will be submitted at the request of either party to binding arbitration in accordance with the Expedited Procedures of the American Arbitration Association's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures, as amended and effective on July 1, 2002. If arbitration is requested, the Termination Date will be extended if necessary to a date that is thirty (30) days following the issuance of the arbitrator's ruling. -13-

Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI of this Agreement are satisfied, to the extent such matters are within the control of Sellers, and Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI of this Agreement are satisfied to the extent such matters are within the control of Buyer. Sellers and Buyer further covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use their reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be. Section 5.7 Certain Tax Matters. (a) Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement: (i) "Pre-Closing Period" means any taxable period, including that portion of any Straddle Period, which ends on or before the Closing Date; (ii) "Section 338(h)(10) Election" means the election to be made by Buyer and Sprint pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, as described in Section 5.7(b) of this Agreement; (iii) "Section 754 Election" means the election to be made by Cendon pursuant to Section 754 of the Code, as described in Section 5.7(b) (ii) of this Agreement; and -52-
(iv) "Straddle Period" means any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date. (b) Section 338(h)(10) and Section 754 Elections. (i) Sprint will join with Buyer in making the Section 338(h)(10) Election to treat the transaction hereunder as the deemed sale of the assets of the Wholly Owned Companies for federal and, to the extent applicable, state and local income tax purposes. Buyer will determine an allocation of the "ADSP" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.338-4 and 1.338(h)(10)-1) among the assets of the Companies pursuant to the applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code; provided, however, that the Allocation will include an allocation of ADSP to any amounts receivable by any of the Companies without regard to whether such receivables have been recognized or realized by the Sellers or any of the Companies for income tax or financial accounting purposes prior to Closing (as determined finally in accordance with this Section 5.7(b)(i), the "Allocation"). Promptly following Buyer's determination of the Allocation, Buyer will deliver a proposed Allocation to Sprint. If Sprint objects to Buyer's Allocation, Sprint will deliver a notice of objection to Buyer no later than the later to occur of (A) thirty (30) days from the delivery of the proposed Allocation to Sprint and (B) one hundred and twenty (120) days before the due date of filing any Tax Returns for which the Allocation is relevant. If no such notice of objection is delivered, the Buyer's proposed Allocation shall be final, and if such notice of objection is delivered as set forth above, Buyer and Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to agree upon the Allocation. If the parties are unable to agree upon the Allocation within ninety (90) days before the due date of filing any Tax Return for which the Allocation is relevant, the Allocation shall be made by the Unrelated Accounting Firm. Following final determination of the Allocation, Buyer and Sellers -53-
will use the Allocation in reporting the deemed purchase and sale of the assets of the Companies for federal and, to the extent applicable, state and local income tax purposes. (ii) The Sellers agree that the Sellers will cause Cendon to make the Section 754 Election for the taxable year including the Closing Date to adjust the basis of all properties and assets of Cendon to account for the transfer of CDC's membership interest in Cendon to Buyer for federal and, to the extent applicable, state and local income tax purposes. Sprint and Buyer agree that Buyer's basis in CenDon will be made based on and consistent with the Allocation made pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(i) of this Agreement. (c) Return Filing, Refunds, Credits and Transfer Taxes. (i) Except with regard to Tax Returns for Straddle Periods, Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all Tax Returns of or including the Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods (the "Pre-Closing Period Returns"). Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to the Companies shown to be due on the Pre-Closing Period Returns. (ii) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all Tax Returns other than the Pre-Closing Period Returns with respect to the Companies, including Tax Returns, if any, for the Straddle Period (the "Straddle Period Returns"). Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns. (iii) Buyer shall provide Sellers with copies of any Straddle Period Returns at least sixty (60) business days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto), accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail Sellers' indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 5.7(e) of this Agreement (the "Indemnification -54-
Statement"). Sellers shall have the right to review such Straddle Period Returns and Indemnification Statement prior to the filing of such Straddle Period Returns. If Sellers dispute any amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns or the amount calculated in the Indemnification Statement, Sellers and Buyer shall consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of the review of such Straddle Period Return and Indemnification Statement. If Sellers agree to the Indemnification Statement amount, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Taxes shown on the Indemnification Statement less any amounts paid by Sellers or the Companies on or before the Closing Date with respect to estimated taxes not later than three business days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return. If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within thirty (30) business days after Sellers' receipt of such Straddle Period Return and Indemnification Statement, such dispute shall be resolved by the Unrelated Accounting Firm, which shall resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as practicable. If the Unrelated Accounting Firm is unable to make a determination with respect to any disputed issue prior to the due date (including any extensions) for the filing of the Straddle Period Return in question, (A) Buyer shall file, or shall cause to be filed, such Straddle Period Return without such determination having been made and (B) Sellers shall pay to Buyer, not later than three days before the due date (including any extensions thereof) for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period Return, an amount determined by Sellers as the proper amount chargeable to Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.7. Upon delivery to Sellers and Buyer by the Unrelated Accounting Firm of its determination, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the amount paid by Sellers in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence in order to reflect the decision of the -55-
Unrelated Accounting Firm. The determination by the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. (iv) Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund), including maintaining and making available to each other all necessary records in connection with determining Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer recognizes that Sellers will need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and tax records and information held by the Companies to the extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, (A) retain and maintain such records until such time as Sellers determine that such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary and (B) allow Sellers and their agents and representatives (and agents and representatives of their Affiliates) reasonable access to inspect, review and make copies of such records as Sellers may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. Buyer shall indemnify Sellers from and against any penalties, additions to tax or interest imposed on Sellers as a direct result of any failure of Buyer to provide tax records or other information to Sellers in a reasonable timely manner. (v) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to, dispose of or destroy any of the business records and files of the Companies relating to Taxes in existence on the Closing Date without first offering to turn over possession thereof to Sellers by written notice to Sellers at least 30 days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction. -56-
(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any refunds and credits of Taxes of the Companies (including any interest or similar benefit) received from or credited thereon by the applicable tax authority with respect to (A) any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or (B) Taxes for which Sellers have indemnified the Buyer under the Agreement, shall be for the account of Sellers, and if received or utilized by Buyer or the Companies, shall be paid to Sellers within five business days after Buyer or a Company receives such refund or utilizes such credit. Except as provided in the next sentence, any refunds or credits of the Companies with respect to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, on the basis of an interim closing of the books. In the case of a refund or credit attributable to any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are attributable to the Straddle Period, other than Taxes based upon or related to gross or net income or receipts, the refund or credit of such Taxes of the Company for the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such refund or credit for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period. (vii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer, stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes, but not including any Taxes on or measured by income, gains or profits, incurred in connection with and solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer, and Buyer shall, at its own expense, accurately file or cause to be filed all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and timely pay all such Taxes; provided, however, that in the event the amount of such Taxes exceeds $5,000 (the "Transfer Tax Limit"), Buyer and -57-
Sellers shall each be responsible for paying one-half of the amount by which such Taxes exceed the Transfer Tax Limit. If required by applicable law, Sellers will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or such other documentation. (d) Elections. Except with respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the Section 754 Election, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to, make, amend, or revoke any Tax election if such action would adversely affect Sellers, or any Person (other than the Companies) as to whom or with whom Sellers have filed a consolidated return, with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or for the Pre-Closing Period or any Tax refund with respect thereto and Seller shall not make any Tax election if such action would adversely affect Buyer or any Company. (e) Tax Indemnification. (i) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates, at any time after the Closing, from and against any liability for Taxes of the Companies for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date except for Straddle Periods, in which case Buyer's indemnity will cover only that portion of any such Taxes that is not attributable to the Pre-Closing Period and, except to the extent any such Taxes arose out of or related to any breach of any representation made by Sellers pursuant to Section 3.16 of the Agreement. (ii) Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, at any time after the Closing, (A) from and against any liability for Taxes of the Companies, except as provided in Section 5.7(c)(vii) of the Agreement, for the Pre-Closing Period (including Taxes attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date); and (B) any liability for income Taxes of any member of an -58-
affiliated group with which any Company files or has filed a consolidated or combined Tax Return with respect to any taxable period which ends before or includes the Closing Date by reason of any Company being severally liable for such Tax pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous provision of foreign, state or local law. (iii) In determining the responsibility of Sellers and Buyer for Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period, Taxes based upon or related to gross or net income or receipts shall be apportioned on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity which is a Company or in which a Company holds an interest, shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and all other Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period shall be prorated on a daily basis. (iv) If a claim for Taxes shall be made by any taxing authority in writing, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to this Section 5.7, the party seeking indemnification (the "Tax Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the other party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") in writing of such claim (a "Tax Claim") within a reasonably sufficient period of time to allow the Tax Indemnifying Party effectively to contest such Tax Claim, and in reasonable detail to apprise the Tax Indemnifying Party of the nature of the Tax Claim, and provide copies of all correspondence and documents received by it from the relevant taxing authority. Failure to give prompt notice of a Tax Claim hereunder shall affect the Tax Indemnifying Party's obligation under this Section to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give prompt notice. (v) With respect to any Tax Claim which might result in an indemnity payment to Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.7(e) (including, without limitation, Taxes -59-
of a Company for a Straddle Period), Sellers shall, upon confirming in writing their obligation to indemnify Buyer in respect of such Tax Claim, control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without limiting the foregoing, may in their sole discretion and at their sole expense pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in their sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest such Tax Claim. Buyer, without waiving its right to be indemnified in respect of such Tax Claim, shall not under any circumstances settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim referred to in the preceding sentence without Sellers' prior written consent; provided, however, that Sellers have confirmed in writing their obligation to indemnify Buyer in respect of such Tax Claim and are in material compliance with Sellers' indemnification obligation hereunder. In connection with any proceeding taken in connection with such Tax Claim, (A) Sellers shall keep Buyer informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim and (B) Buyer shall have the right, at its sole expense, to participate in any such proceedings. Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers in contesting such Tax Claim (without charge to Sellers), which cooperation shall include, without limitation, the retention and the provision to Sellers of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available to Sellers to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim; provided, however, that no charges shall be incurred by Sellers for the services of such employees. (vi) With respect to any Tax Claim not described in Section 5.7(e)(v) of this Agreement which might result in an indemnity payment to Sellers -60-
pursuant hereto, Buyer shall control all proceedings in accordance with provisions that are parallel to those in Section 5.7(e)(v) of this Agreement. (vii) All matters relating in any manner to Tax indemnification obligations and payment of Taxes shall be governed exclusively by this Section 5.7. Section 5.8 No Solicitation. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason pursuant to Article VII, for a period of two years following the effective date of such termination, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or induce any employee, agent or contractor of any Company to leave such employment and become an employee, agent or contractor of Buyer or any of its Affiliates if Buyer was apprised of or had contact with such employee, agent or contractor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.8 shall prohibit Buyer or any of its Affiliates from employing any person who contacts them on his or her own initiative and without any direct or indirect solicitation by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be. This Section 5.8 shall not be interpreted to prohibit solicitations of employment through general advertising not specifically directed at the employees, agents or contractors of the Companies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII, this Section 5.8 supersedes the employee nonsolicitation provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements. Section 5.9 Transition Services Agreement. At the Closing, Sprint and/or certain of its Affiliates and the Companies shall enter into a Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 5.9 (the "Transition Services Agreement").

Section 5.12 Investigation by Buyer. Buyer has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Companies and acknowledges that Sellers have provided Buyer with the access requested by Buyer to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the Companies for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement, Buyer has relied upon its own investigation and analysis as well as the representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and Buyer (a) acknowledges that none of Sellers, the Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives, and (b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that neither Sellers, the Companies nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives on any basis (including, without limitation, in contract or tort, under federal or -62-
state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or statements made, to Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives (or any omissions therefrom), except in the case of clauses (a) and (b) as and only to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to the representations and warranties of Sellers in Article III and subject to the limitations and restrictions contained in this Agreement.

business as the Company Employees; provided, however, (3) Buyer shall provide severance benefits to any such individual whose employment is terminated by Buyer or, if Buyer transfers such individual to another employer as part of an outsourcing arrangement, is terminated by such other employer at any time during the one year period which starts on the Closing which are no less than the severance benefits provided under the Sprint Corporation Separation Plan which would have been payable under such plan if such individual's employment had been terminated by a Company under similar circumstances immediately before the Closing and (4) Buyer shall not have any obligation to employ immediately after the Closing (A) any individual named on Schedule 5.14 or (B) any individual who has met all the requirements for short-term or long-term disability benefits under one of the Seller Benefit Plans on or before the Closing until such individual is able to return to work, at which point Buyer's obligation to employ such individual shall be subject to such terms and conditions as permissible under applicable law with respect to any employee who had been on a short-term or long-term disability leave, and any such individual then employed by Buyer shall be eligible for the same benefits upon his or her employment as then provided to Company Employees. Each Company Employee shall receive credit for all service completed with Sellers, each Company and each ERISA Affiliate (and their predecessors) immediately prior to the Closing for all purposes under Buyer's employee benefit plans as if such service had been completed with Buyer; provided, however that Buyer shall have no obligation to provide such service credit for purposes of computing any such employee's accrued benefit under any defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) or determining any such employee's eligibility to receive post- retirement welfare benefits. -64-
(b) 401(k) Plans. (i) Sprint 401(k) Plan. Sprint shall make contributions on behalf of the Company Employees to the Seller ERISA Plan which is the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan through the Closing, but Sprint shall take such action as necessary or appropriate to assure that no Company Employee shall be eligible to make or receive contributions under such plan for any period ending after the Closing and that no Company Employee will be eligible to otherwise actively participate in such plan after the Closing. Sprint shall take whatever action is necessary or appropriate with respect to each Company Employee who is employed by Buyer immediately after the Closing to (1) make his or her account under the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan nonforfeitable as of the Closing and (2) provide the same opportunity to each such Company Employee to repay his or her loan or loans, if any, from such plan as currently provided under the terms of the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan to the only class of employees who currently have such opportunity under the terms of such plan upon a termination of employment. (ii) Buyer 401(k) Plan. The Company Employees shall be eligible as of the Closing to participate in a plan established, maintained or adopted by Buyer which is described in Section 401(k) of the Code (individually a "Buyer 401(k) Plan") and which shall provide for elective deferrals (as such deferrals are described in Section 402(g)(3)(A) of the Code) by participants under Section 401(k) of the Code and for matching contributions (as described in Section 401(m)(4)(A)(ii) of the Code) by Buyer with respect to such elective deferrals, all consistent with the requirements of Section 5.14(a)(2)(A). The Buyer 401(k) Plan shall provide that the Company Employees shall have the right to make direct rollovers to such plan of their vested accounts in the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan to the extent such rollovers -65-
constitute "eligible rollover distributions" within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code. The Company Employees shall receive credit under the Buyer 401(k) Plan for all service with Sellers, each Company and each ERISA Affiliate (and their predecessors) for purposes of satisfying any service requirement to participate in such plan and any service requirement to earn a nonforfeitable benefit under such plan. (c) Pension Plans. (i) Sprint Pension Plan. Sprint shall take such action as necessary or appropriate to assure that no Company Employees shall be eligible to accrue any benefits for service completed or compensation paid for periods after the Closing under the Seller Benefit Plan which is the Sprint Retirement Pension Plan and that no Company Employees will be eligible to otherwise actively participate in such plan after the Closing. (ii) Buyer Pension Plan. If any employees of Buyer (as determined in accordance with the rules under Section 414(b) and Section 414(c) of the Code) participate in any defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) other than a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 414(f) of the Code) (individually a "Buyer Pension Plan"), the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in such plan as of the Closing. If there is more than one Buyer Pension Plan, the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Buyer Pension Plan which in Buyer's reasonable judgment provides benefits which in the aggregate are more like the benefits provided under the Sprint Retirement Pension Plan than the benefits provided under any other Buyer Pension Plan. The Company Employees shall receive credit under the Buyer Pension Plan in which such employees participate for all service with Sellers, each Company, and each ERISA Affiliate (and their predecessors) for -66-
purposes of satisfying any service requirement to participate in such plan and any service requirement to earn a nonforfeitable benefit under such plan, but Buyer shall have no obligation to provide such service credit for purposes of computing any such employee's accrued benefit under such plan.

Sellers shall continue after the Closing to make available to each Company Employee coverage under the Seller Benefit Plans which are welfare plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), including post-retirement health and dental benefit coverage, to the same extent, and subject to the same terms and conditions, that such coverage would be continued under the terms of such plans for any other former employee, and each such Company Employee who satisfies the age and service requirements for post-retirement health and dental benefit coverage immediately prior to the Closing shall have the same opportunity to receive such coverage after the Closing as if such Company Employee had terminated employment immediately prior to the Closing. (ii) Buyer Welfare Plans. Buyer on the Closing shall make available to the Company Employees Buyer's welfare plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) consistent with the requirements of Section 5.14(a)(2)(B), and each Company Employee shall receive full credit under Buyer's welfare plans for all service completed with Sellers, each Company and each ERISA Affiliate (and their predecessors) and for all payments made by such employee under any similar Seller Benefit Plan to satisfy any deductible or co-pay requirements under such plan; provided, however that Buyer shall have no obligation to provide such service credit for purposes of determining any such employee's eligibility to receive post-retirement welfare benefits. -67-
(e) 2002 Management Incentive Plan. In the event the Closing occurs prior to Sprint making the payments called for under the Companies' 2002 Management Incentive Plan for Company Employees based on their performance for the year 2002, Sprint shall compute the payments due such employees and shall instruct Buyer as to the amount of such payments due such employees. Buyer then shall make the payments due such Company Employees pursuant to such instructions. Sprint will reimburse Buyer for any payments made to such Company Employees pursuant to this Section 5.14(e) and for the tax paid by Buyer on such payments in accordance with Section 3111(b) of the Code within ten (10) business days of the date Buyer certifies to Sprint that such payments have been made and such taxes have been paid. Sprint will be responsible for computing the payments due under this Section 5.14(e), for answering any questions from Company Employees regarding such payments and for resolving any disputes with any Company Employee regarding Sprint's computations.

listed on Schedule 3.7. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the indemnification or indemnification procedures provided for under this Section 9.1 shall not apply to Tax matters, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 5.7.

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedure. (a) Promptly after receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred to as an "Indemnified Party") of written notice by a third party of a threatened or filed claim or of the threatened or actual commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other party for any Buyer Losses or Seller Losses (as the case may be), such Indemnified Party shall notify Buyer (on the one hand) or Sellers (on the other hand), whoever is the appropriate indemnifying party hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party"), within thirty (30) days of the written notice of threatening or filing of such claim or of the threatened or actual commencement of such action or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to assume the defense of such action or proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel. In any action or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in such litigation and to retain its own counsel at such party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any action the defense of which they are -81-
maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such action. (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (i) simultaneously with the effectiveness of such settlement, compromise or consent, the Indemnifying Party pays in full any obligation imposed on the Indemnified Party by such settlement, compromise or consent, which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such settlement, compromise or consent and (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Party's Affiliates. (c) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement not involving a third party claim covered by Section 9.3(a), such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim. As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party shall establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five business days of the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder. -82-
Section 9.4 Claims Period. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Claims Period" shall be the period after the Closing Date which a claim for indemnification may be asserted under this Agreement by an Indemnified Party. The Claims Periods under this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate with respect to Buyer Losses or Seller Losses arising with respect to (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty on the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 8.1 and (b) with respect to any breach or nonperformance of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, six months after the date Buyer (with respect to any Buyer Indemnified Party) or Sellers (with respect to any Seller Indemnified Party), as the case may be, obtains Knowledge of such breach or nonperformance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Section 9.5 Liability Limits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, except for fraud, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against Sellers for indemnification under Section 9.1(a) for Buyer Losses (a) for any single Buyer Loss less than $250,000 and (b) unless and until the aggregate amount of Buyer Losses under Section 9.1(a) exceeds $25,000,000 (the "Buyer Deductible"), and then only to the extent such Buyer Losses exceed the Buyer Deductible. Further, the sum of Sellers' indemnification obligations hereunder and any amounts payable by Sprint for consequential damages resulting -83-
from a breach by Sprint or its Affiliates under the Trademark License Agreement, shall not exceed in the aggregate $660,000,000 (the "Cap Amount"). Section 9.6 Netting of Losses. The amount of any Seller Losses or Buyer Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall take into account (a) in the case of Sellers' indemnification obligations under Section 9.1 of this Agreement, any specific reserves included in the Final Balance Sheet and included in the determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital, (b) in the case of Sellers' indemnification obligations under Section 9.1 of this Agreement or Buyer's indemnification obligations under Section 9.2 of this Agreement, (i) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification agreement with, any third party, and (ii) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received in connection with any such Seller Losses or Buyer Losses and (c) any Tax consequences associated with such Losses and the recovery thereof. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 of this Agreement is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article IX had such determination been made at the time of such payment. Section 9.7 Exclusive Remedies. Except for fraud, the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 5.7 and 10.11 set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of Buyer and Sellers to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any party with respect to matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any remedy or relief arising from the failure of any party to perform its obligations under the Ancillary Agreements).

ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS Section 10.1 Fees and Expenses.
