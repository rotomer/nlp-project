Exhibit 99 - Sprint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2002 Results The Sprint FON Group (NYSE: FON) consists of Sprint's Global Markets Division, Local Division and other operations. The Sprint PCS Group (NYSE: PCS) consists of Sprint's mobile wireless operations. OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - Feb. 5, 2003 - Sprint today released its earnings report for the fourth quarter and full-year 2002. In the quarter, the FON Group reported strong earnings growth and another solid performance in generating cash, while the PCS Group also reported significant improvements in cash flows and resumed customer growth. Additionally, the company continued to make significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $6.53 billion compared to $6.52 billion last year. Full- year 2002 consolidated revenues were $26.63 billion, up 4 percent from $25.52 billion in 2001. Fourth quarter operating income of $388 million was a significant improvement from an operating loss a year ago of $1.71 billion, which was due largely to the effect of restructuring and asset impairment charges. Fourth quarter net income was $39 million compared to a fourth quarter loss of $1.23 billion in 2001. During the quarter, the company's operations produced more than $665 million of positive free cash flow*. Due to continuing strong cash management, Sprint achieved better-than-expected full-year free cash flow of $1.31 billion. Sprint's 2002 full-year free cash flow improved by more than $5.8 billion compared to 2001 levels. "This year has been significant on three major fronts -- improving our operating performance, vigilant cost containment and a significantly improved balance sheet," said William T. Esrey, Sprint chairman and chief executive officer. "Our progress in these areas positions us favorably in 2003." The FON Group reported fourth quarter earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 28 cents per share compared to a loss of $1.06 per share a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share for the quarter were 37 cents compared to 23 cents per share in the same period a year ago. For the full year, FON Group earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.18 compared to a loss of 33 cents last year. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share in 2002 were $1.36 versus $1.05 in 2001. The PCS Group reported a fourth quarter loss per share of 25 cents from continuing operations compared to a loss of 32 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding one-time items, the PCS Group had a fourth quarter loss of 18 cents per share compared to a loss of 32 cents per share in the year-ago period. For the full year, the PCS Group recorded a loss of 58 cents per share from continuing operations versus a loss of $1.27 in 2001. Excluding one-time items, full-year loss per share was 63 cents versus a loss of $1.27 in 2001. SPRINT FON GROUP HIGHLIGHTS The following FON Group discussion excludes one-time items that decreased 2002 fourth quarter operating income $125 million and income from continuing operations $78 million, or 9 cents per share. One-time items decreased full-year operating income $281 million and income from continuing operations $157 million, or 18 cents per share. These items include restructuring and asset impairment charges, losses related to bad debt expense associated with the WorldCom bankruptcy, gains on the sale of customer contracts, a write-down of an investment due to a declining market value, and tax benefits not previously recognized. In the 2001 fourth quarter, one-time items decreased operating income $1.83 billion and income from continuing operations $1.14 billion, or $1.29 per share. Total 2001 one-time items decreased operating income $1.83 billion and income from continuing operations $1.23 billion, or $1.38 per share. These items included the restructuring and asset impairment charges, litigation in the Global Markets Division, gains on the sale of equity investments, and a benefit plan curtailment gain. In addition, the 2001 fourth quarter and year-to-date discussions exclude the results of ION. ION generated an operating loss of $57 million in the 2001 fourth quarter and an operating loss of $538 million for the 2001 full year. ION had no impact on the 2002 fourth quarter and a nominal impact on the year-to-date results. o Net operating revenues in the quarter were $3.66 billion compared to $3.87 billion in the same period a year ago. For the year, revenues were $15.18 billion, down 7 percent from $16.35 billion in 2001. o Operating income in the quarter was $504 million, up 39 percent from $363 million in the same period last year. Full-year operating income was $1.88 billion compared to $2.10 billion in 2001. o EBITDA* in the quarter was $1.18 billion, up 22 percent from $966 million in the same period a year ago. For the year, EBITDA was $4.53 billion, up 2 percent from $4.42 billion in 2001. o Net income in the quarter rose 36 percent to $372 million from $273 million in the year-ago period. Full-year net income fell 4 percent to $1.37 billion from $1.42 billion in 2001. o Capital expenditures were $631 million for the quarter and $2.18 billion for 2002. Local Telecommunications Division o Total revenues in the quarter fell modestly to $1.56 billion from $1.58 billion in the year-ago period. For the year, revenues were also down modestly at $6.21 billion in 2002 versus $6.25 billion in 2001. o Operating income in the quarter declined 8 percent to $471 million from $511 million. Full-year operating income was $1.91 billion, up 1 percent from $1.89 billion in 2001. o Total access lines declined 1.7 percent in 2002. Voice grade equivalent lines grew 9 percent. o EBITDA in the quarter declined 4 percent to $763 million from $791 million in the previous fourth quarter. EBITDA for the year was $3.07 billion, a 2 percent increase from $3.01 billion in 2001. The local division delivered solid results in the quarter and full-year 2002. Full-year results were highlighted by increases in operating and EBITDA margins despite a challenging operating environment in which wireless and broadband substitution, competition and a sluggish economy impacted its performance. The division continued to outperform the regional Bell companies in most financial metrics. The division added 38,000 new DSL lines and ended the quarter with over 150,000 lines in service. DSL penetration increased to 4 percent of capable lines, and average revenue per DSL customer was $48. In the quarter, consumer bundle penetration increased to 26 percent. Forty-eight percent of residential customers' lines subscribed to Sprint long distance, up from 45 percent in the year-ago period. Global Markets Division o Total revenues for the quarter dropped 8 percent to $2.10 billion from $2.28 billion in the year- ago period. For the year, revenues declined 10 percent to $8.94 billion from $9.90 billion in 2001. o Operating income for the quarter was a positive $39 million compared to an operating loss of $139 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income for 2002 was $8 million compared to $201 million for 2001. o EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $419 million compared to $187 million in the same period last year. For the year, EBITDA was $1.49 billion, up 6 percent from $1.40 billion in 2001. Throughout 2002 the global markets division focused on strong cost management that drove solid improvement in EBITDA. In the fourth quarter, the division reported double-digit year-over-year reductions in both cost of services and products and selling, general and administration expenses. Reduced volumes also contributed to these cost reductions in the quarter. As 2002 wound down, the pricing environment for long-distance services continued to stabilize. However, the pace of the economy continues to dampen overall demand for telecom services. Customer wins of enterprise-level sales from distressed competitors continue to grow and are expected to contribute nearly $400 million over the next couple of years. In addition, the division recently announced major airline partnerships with United Airlines, US Air and America West. In the quarter, data services revenues increased 7 percent year-over-year. Frame Relay and ATM revenues both increased more than 20 percent from the same period last year. Internet revenues increased 9 percent from the same period last year. Internationally, the division continued to expand Sprint's global IP network and won new business from enterprise, carrier and ISP accounts in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. SPRINT PCS GROUP HIGHLIGHTS The following PCS Group discussion excludes one-time items that decreased fourth quarter operating income $120 million and income from continuing operations $76 million, or 7 cents per share. One-time items decreased full-year operating income $121 million and increased income from continuing operations $47 million, or 5 cents per share. These items include restructuring and asset impairment charges, losses related to bad debt expense associated with the WorldCom bankruptcy, a gain on the sale of its investments in Pegaso and tax benefits not previously recognized. In the 2001 fourth quarter and full year, one-time items decreased operating income $10 million and income from continuing operations $7 million, which had no per share impact. These items included restructuring and asset impairment charges. o Net operating revenues increased 11 percent in the quarter to $3.05 billion compared to $2.76 billion in the year-ago period. Full-year revenues were up 24 percent to $12.07 from $9.73 billion in 2001. o Net customer additions were 250,000 in the quarter, and, for the full year, Sprint added more than 1.2 million net new customers. Both periods were down from 2001. o Customer churn* for the quarter was 3.5 percent, a decline of 30 basis points sequentially. Full-year churn was 3.3 percent compared to 2.6 percent a year ago. o ARPU* for the quarter was just over $62 compared to just under $61 in the fourth quarter a year ago. ARPU for the year was nearly $62 compared to nearly $61 in 2001. o Fourth quarter EBITDA nearly doubled to $729 million from $367 million in the year-ago period. Full-year EBITDA improved by almost 90 percent to $2.86 billion from $1.51 billion in 2001. o Fourth quarter operating income of $120 million was a significant improvement from an operating loss of $182 million in the same period last year. In 2002, the PCS Group achieved its first full-year operating income of $596 million versus an operating loss of $637 million in 2001. o CPGA* was approximately $370 in the fourth quarter due to lower gross adds, up from $315 in the year-ago period. For the full year, cost to acquire a new customer was $350 compared to $305 a year ago. CCPU* for the quarter was under $32 as compared to just under $35 in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year, CCPU was just over $32 compared to just over $35 last year. o Capital expenditures were $590 million for the quarter and $2.67 billion in 2002. In the quarter, the PCS Group customer gains were driven by a double-digit sequential increase in gross customer additions. In the quarter, customer additions included a much higher percentage of prime credit users. The PCS Group continued to achieve strong average revenue per user, driven by average customer usage of nearly 11 hours per month, a full 20 percent above the usage levels for the same period last year. Throughout 2002, the PCS Group has maintained strong cost controls including appropriate balancing of resources to achieve improved profitability. In the fourth quarter, PCS Group results were also aided by a significant reduction in bad debt expense. At the end of the quarter, there were more than 600,000 PCS Vision users. In the fourth quarter, the PCS Group made significant progress in enhancing customer care, which is contributing to improving levels of customer satisfaction. Pension Accounting In accordance with pension accounting standards, Sprint was required to record an additional minimum pension liability at Dec. 31, 2002. This additional liability is recorded when the accrued pension benefit obligation exceeds the market value of the underlying pension assets. This non-cash adjustment resulted in an after-tax charge to Other Comprehensive Income of $713 million, and resulted in a corresponding reduction to shareholders' equity. This adjustment did not impact reported net income or earnings per share. *Sprint provides readers financial measures generated using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect industry conventions, or standard measures of liquidity, profitability or performance commonly used by the investment community for comparability purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures and the operating measures used in this release include the following: Free cash flow is defined as cash generated from operations less net cash requirements for capital expenditures, other investment activities and dividends. Currently, Sprint also includes cash generated from discontinued operations. EBITDA is measured as operating income or loss plus depreciation and amortization. Customer churn is defined as the ratio of customers discontinuing PCS service over total average subscribers for the period. ARPU (Average monthly revenue per user) is a measure of average monthly service revenue per user. CCPU (Cash cost per user) is a measure of the cash costs to operate the business on a per user basis consisting of costs of service revenues, service delivery and other general and administrative costs divided by average subscribers. CPGA (Cost per gross addition) is a measure of the sales and marketing efforts computed as the costs of acquiring a new subscriber, including equipment subsidies and marketing costs divided by handset activations. The press release tables included in this document are an integral part of the reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This release is not complete without the tables. Business Outlook The following statements are based on current expectations for 2003. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. Sprint is reiterating its 2003 guidance for the PCS Group. This includes: Customer additions and retention: The company expects to gain a high-teen percent of industry customer acquisitions within its markets, and has targeted gross customer additions to be in the low- to mid-6 million range. EBITDA is targeted to be between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Growth in EBITDA in the coming year is expected to be driven by a larger customer base, steady ARPU performance and reduced cash cost per user. Capital expenditures are expected to decline to a range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. These investments are targeted largely for expanded coverage and increased capacity in the network. Sprint is also reiterating its 2003 guidance for the FON Group. This includes: Revenues are targeted to decline at a low single-digit rate. Global Markets Division revenues are expected to decline at a mid-single digit rate. Local Telecommunications Division revenue is expected to be flat and Product Distribution is targeted to resume growth. A protracted slow economy could particularly impact achievement of top line goals in Global Markets and Product Distribution. Earnings guidance: Full-year earnings in 2003 are expected to be between $1.40 and $1.45 per share. Incorporated into this estimate is increased pension costs, which are currently estimated to reduce earnings by 11 cents per share versus no impact in 2002. EBITDA is expected to be approximately $4.5 billion. In the coming year, local division EBITDA is expected to decline modestly while global markets EBITDA is expected to rise modestly. Operating income is expected to be flat to down modestly from 2002 levels. Capital expenditures are expected to increase slightly to $2.3 billion. In 2003, global markets has targeted capital of $800 million primarily to support growth in demand for enterprise services. The local division capital plan of $1.4 billion includes investments for broadband initiatives and the phased transition from circuit to packet switching. Cash requirements: In 2003, Sprint expects overall free cash flow to be approximately $1.2 billion, including breakeven performance in the PCS Group. Additionally, Sprint received $2.1 billion from the sale of our directory business.
