Employer Identification No.) 6200 Sprint Parkway, Overland Park, Kansas 66251 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code (913) 624-3000 (Former name or former address, if changed since last report) P.

Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. On December 1, 2003, KPMG LLP ("KPMG") was engaged as independent auditor for Sprint Corporation ("Sprint") and for the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan ("Plan") for the year ending December 31, 2004. As previously reported, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Sprint determined that Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") would be replaced by KPMG as the independent auditor for Sprint and for the Plan for the year ending December 31, 2004. This action effectively dismisses Ernst & Young as Sprint's and the Plan's independent auditor for the year ending December 31, 2004; however, Ernst & Young will continue as Sprint's and the Plan's independent auditor for the year ending December 31, 2003. Ernst & Young's reports on the Plan's financial statements as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 and through the date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements between Sprint or the Plan and Ernst & Young on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused Ernst & Young to make reference to the matter in their report. None of the "reportable events" described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission have occurred during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 or 2002 or through the date of this Form 8-K. Sprint has requested Ernst & Young to furnish the Plan with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether Ernst & Young agrees with the above statements. A copy of Ernst & Young's letter, dated December 4, 2003, is attached as Exhibit 16 to this Form 8-K. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002 and through the date of this Form 8-K, neither Sprint nor the Plan nor anyone acting on their behalf consulted KPMG regarding (1) either the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plan's financial statements or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement with Ernst & Young on accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused Ernst & Young to make reference to the matter in their report, or a "reportable event" as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
