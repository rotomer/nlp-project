Exhibit 99 Sprint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2003 Results o Sprint reports full-year Free Cash Flow* of $2.3 billion o FON Group reports improving revenue comparisons, strong cash flows o PCS Group delivers strong operating and financial performance OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - Feb. 3, 2004: The Sprint FON Group (NYSE: FON) is comprised of Sprint's global markets division, local division and other businesses consisting primarily of wholesale distribution of telecommunications products. The Sprint PCS Group (NYSE: PCS) consists of Sprint's mobile wireless operations. Sprint today announced fourth quarter and full-year 2003 financial results. Sprint completed the year with improving top-line performance, substantial progress on profitability and excellent cash flow generation. In the quarter, Sprint's total net operating revenues increased 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002; total Adjusted Operating Income* was up 20%; and fourth quarter Free Cash Flow* totaled $581 million. In the quarter, Sprint made strong gains in key growth metrics. The PCS Group added over one million net customers in the fourth quarter, consisting of 390,000 net direct customer additions combined with 640,000 from our wholesale and affiliate partners. The PCS Group, through all channels, was serving a total of 20.4 million customers at the end of the year, an increase of more than 2.6 million, or 15%, from a year ago. The Local Division surpassed 300,000 DSL subscribers, and sales of Sprint Complete Sense, Sprint's bundle of communication services including competitive local service, topped 280,000 following its second quarter launch. On the strength of its product bundling expertise, Sprint improved product penetration in its local customer base, exiting the year with two out of three local consumer customers taking one or more of Sprint's strategic products in addition to local phone service. The FON Group reported earnings per share from continuing operations of 40 cents for the fourth quarter, compared to 28 cents in the fourth quarter of 2002. Before special items described in the FON discussion below, FON Group's Adjusted EPS* was 39 cents versus 37 cents in the year-ago period, a 5% increase. The PCS Group reported a loss from continuing operations of 31 cents per share for the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of 25 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Before special items described in the PCS discussion below, the PCS Group reported a 10 cent Adjusted loss per share* versus an 18 cent loss in the year-ago period, a 44% improvement.
"I'm pleased with our operational and financial performance in the period," said Gary Forsee, Sprint chairman and chief executive officer. "Our results demonstrate that we kept our eye focused on execution even as we worked extensively to transform our organization to market-facing units for the business and consumer segments. "We achieved good progress in 2003 on profitability within both the FON Group and PCS Group. FON Group exceeded the original Adjusted EPS* goal for the year, and the PCS Group exceeded the Adjusted EBITDA* goal for the year," Forsee added. "Our momentum is also evident in our growing financial strength and flexibility as we reduced Net Debt* for the full year by $4.2 billion and significantly improved credit ratios. Throughout 2003 the Sprint team was able to overcome market challenges, and I am delighted to report that we enter 2004 with a streamlined, customer-driven organization that is eager to build on these successes." Fourth quarter consolidated net operating revenues were $6.7 billion, compared to $6.5 billion in the same period last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $38 million versus net income of $39 million for the same period last year. Operating income was $325 million in the fourth quarter compared with operating income of $388 million a year ago. Adjusted Operating Income* was up 20% to $759 million this quarter, compared with $633 million a year ago. Full year Adjusted Operating Income* was $2.9 billion, up 16% from $2.5 billion in 2002. At year-end 2003, cash on hand was $2.4 billion as Sprint continues to be ahead of schedule on planned debt reduction. In the quarter, Net Debt* was cut by $392 million and now stands at $16.7 billion. o In the quarter, FON Group revenues declined 4% from the same period a year ago. Revenues were flat compared to the third quarter and full-year revenues declined 7% compared to last year. o In the quarter, FON Group Adjusted Operating Income* increased 1% compared to last year. Sequentially, this measure was up 4%. o FON Group Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter of $1.14 billion decreased 3% compared to last year and increased 3% on a sequential basis. o FON Group's Free Cash Flow* of $821 million decreased by $29 million compared to $850 million in the year-ago quarter. Full-year Free Cash Flow* of $2 billion increased 16%. The FON Group's 2003 Free Cash Flow* reflects a $400 million pension contribution made in the third quarter.
The difference between reported FON Group EPS and Adjusted EPS*, is the result of the following special items in 2003: o Discontinued operation - reflects the operational activity and gain on sale of Sprint's directory publishing business. o Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle - a pre-tax gain of $420 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. o Restructuring and asset impairments - a pre-tax charge of $18 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 primarily related to severance costs associated with Sprint's transformation to a customer-focused organizational design and additional Web hosting activity offset by true-ups related to the finalization of Sprint's 2001 and 2002 restructuring activities. A pre-tax charge of $1.22 billion was recorded in the third quarter of 2003 related to a revaluation of the fair value of Sprint's MMDS spectrum. A pre-tax charge of $348 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2003 along with an additional $2 million in the third quarter of 2003 primarily associated with the decision to wind down Sprint's Web hosting business. o Executive separation agreements - a pre-tax charge of $17 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2003 for the FON Group's share of charges associated with executive separation agreements. o WorldCom bad debt - a pre-tax benefit of $50 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of a bankruptcy settlement reached with MCI (WorldCom). o Long-term disability - a pre-tax charge of $105 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 after determining an understatement of costs for medical coverage for participants in the long-term disability plan occurred in periods before 2003. o Shareholder litigation charge - a pre-tax charge of $24 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 for the FON Group's share of a shareholder litigation settlement. This charge was partially offset by $8 million of insurance settlements in the third quarter of 2003 and insurance settlements of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. o Premium on early retirement of debt - a pre-tax charge of $19 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 and $2 million in the third quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of approximately $1.2 billion of long-term debt. o Tax benefits - tax benefits of $44 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to the recognition of certain federal and state income tax credits and the cumulative impact of changes in state income tax apportionments. Special items for 2002 are discussed in the attached financial tables.
o Fourth quarter revenues of $1.55 billion declined 1% from $1.56 billion in the year-ago period. Revenues increased 1%, sequentially. o Adjusted EBITDA* was $744 million for the quarter compared to $763 million last year and $729 million in the third quarter. Full-year Adjusted EBITDA* of $2.93 billion is 5% below the comparable period in 2002. o Adjusted Operating Income* was $467 million for the quarter compared to $471 million a year ago and $459 million in the third quarter. Compared to the year-ago quarter, incremental pension related costs reduced Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted Operating Income* by $23 million. o In the quarter, the Local Division added approximately 40,000 DSL customers to end the year with over 304,000 lines. o Total switched access lines declined at a 2.2% annual rate, but were flat sequentially. In addition to strong DSL growth, the Local Division improved penetration of our strategic products, expanded Sprint-branded service beyond our existing markets to Dallas and Kansas City, and made progress in converting circuit-based networks to next-generation packet technology. At the end of the fourth quarter, 66% of our local consumer customers have one or more of our strategic products including long-distance, DSL, Sprint PCS wireless service or a premium package of vertical services. In the quarter, the division successfully converted 20 additional switch complexes to packet technology and had converted a total of nearly 130,000 lines by the end of the year. Total fourth quarter expenses decreased 2% compared to a year ago. Special items accounted for approximately one third of this reduction. Reduced staffing and tight general expense controls mitigated the pension expense. Lower depreciation expense in 2003 was due to the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and reduced depreciation rates on switching equipment.
o Net operating revenues declined 6% to $1.97 billion from $2.10 billion a year ago, but were flat sequentially. Without a customer's partial buyout of its contract for Internet service, fourth quarter revenues would have declined 7% from the year-ago period and would have decreased 1% sequentially. o Adjusted Operating Income* for the quarter was $56 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago period. o Adjusted EBITDA* was $411 million in the quarter, down 2% from the year-ago period and up 5% sequentially. Full-year Adjusted EBITDA* of $1.56 billion is 6% above 2002. In the quarter, total business revenues, including wholesale and affiliates, declined 3% from the year-ago period, but were up 1% sequentially. Consumer revenues were down 19% from the year ago period, and declined 7% sequentially. Revenue declines in consumer long-distance are beginning to be partially mitigated by growing competitive local service revenues from Sprint Complete Sense. This revenue source surpassed $100 million for the year. In the quarter, total voice revenues decreased 8% compared to the year-ago period and 2% sequentially. Voice revenues were impacted by ongoing product substitution and increased competition. Data revenues increased 2% from the year-ago period but declined 1% sequentially. Compared to the year ago period, growth in Frame Relay, private line and managed network services was partially offset by lower ATM revenues. IP revenues declined 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. Excluding the customer contract buyout, fourth quarter IP revenue would have declined 12% from the year-ago period. Within this category, growth in dedicated services was offset by declines in dial-up and hosting revenues. Other revenues were impacted by lower sales of early generation data services. The Global Markets Division total expenses declined 9% compared to the year-ago period. Special items account for 25% of this decline. The remaining 75% of the expense decline is being driven by workforce reductions, reduced depreciation, improvement in bad debt expense and initiatives to improve access unit costs.
o Fourth quarter net subscriber additions include 390,000 post-paid retail, 554,000 from wholesale channels and 86,000 from affiliates. At the end of the period, the PCS Group was serving a total of 20.4 million customers, consisting of 15.9 million direct, 2.9 million affiliates and 1.6 million wholesale. o Direct gross customer additions were 1.67 million in the quarter, a 7% year-over-year decline but an 18% sequential improvement. o Based on strong service revenue, net operating revenues for the PCS Group were up over 8% year over year. Net operating revenues were down 1% sequentially due to higher equipment rebates primarily related to increased take rates on two-year contracts. o Fourth quarter Adjusted Operating Income* was $237 million, an increase of 98% compared to $120 million in the year-ago period. In the third quarter, Adjusted Operating Income* was $284 million. o Adjusted EBITDA* in the fourth quarter was $870 million, a 19% improvement from $729 million a year ago. Full-year Adjusted EBITDA* of $3.43 billion was a 20% increase from 2002. o Average monthly service revenue per user (ARPU)* was $62 in the fourth quarter. This was even with the year-ago period, but a decline of $1 sequentially. During the quarter, average customer usage was approximately 14 hours per month, up from approximately 11 hours in the fourth quarter of 2002. o The cost to acquire a new customer (CPGA)* in the fourth quarter was $425, down sequentially from $465, but above the $370 reported a year ago. CPGA* was impacted by increased sales and distribution costs, increased marketing spending, and increased rebates as a result of higher take rates on two-year contracts. When viewed sequentially, CPGA* declined primarily due to higher gross additions in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, over 95% of new customers chose service agreements, and more than 80% of these new agreements were two years or more in length. o Cash cost per user (CCPU)* was $31 in the fourth quarter, flat sequentially and a reduction of $2 from the year-ago period. On a per unit basis, bad debt, upgrade subsidies and administrative costs were lower while cost of service and customer care costs were higher. o Churn was 2.7% this quarter compared to 2.7% in the third quarter and 3.5% reported a year ago. In late November, wireless local number portability (WLNP) was instituted for larger markets across the United States. While the PCS Group experienced an increase in churn in December following WLNP implementation, the full quarter impact on net additions was immaterial. In the fourth quarter, the PCS Group experienced strong demand for data services. In the period nearly 600,000 net new and existing customers added PCS Vision SM services. At the end of the period more than 3.2 million customers were subscribing to PCS Vision and more than 2.2 million customers subscribed to our first generation data services. Combined, more than a third of the direct customer base are now subscribing to data services. For the full quarter, data contributed nearly 5% to overall ARPU*. The PCS Group continues to enhance its growth potential through strategic alliances. These alliances leverage Sprint's network assets and expand the channels for selling our services. The Virgin Mobile joint venture had excellent growth in the quarter and exited 2003 with more than 1.4 million customers. For the quarter, wholesale and
affiliate revenues totaled $100 million, which was nearly double the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter, the PCS Group made substantial progress in deploying network capacity and enhancing network quality. Capital spending in the quarter was $939 million, bringing the full-year investment to $2.15 billion. The PCS Group added approximately 1,800 cell sites in 2003. The PCS Group's full-year Free Cash Flow* of $308 million is an increase of $900 million over 2002. The 2003 results exclude $700 million of tax sharing payments from the FON Group associated with the sale of the directory publishing business. The difference between reported PCS Group loss per share and Adjusted loss per share*, is the result of the following special items in 2003: o Restructuring and asset impairments - a pre-tax charge of $352 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to the termination of the development of a new billing platform, as well as severance costs associated with Sprint's transformation to a customer-focused organizational design. These charges were partially offset by a benefit recorded to finalize Sprint's restructuring activities of 2001 and 2002. o Executive separation agreements - a pre-tax charge of $19 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2003 for the PCS Group's share of charges associated with executive separation agreements. o Long-term disability - a pre-tax charge of $9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 after determining an understatement of costs for medical coverage for participants in the long-term disability plan occurred in periods before 2003. o Shareholder litigation charge - a pre-tax charge of $26 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 for the PCS Group's share of a shareholder litigation settlement. This charge was partially offset by $9 million of insurance settlements in both the third and fourth quarters of 2003. o Tax benefit - a tax benefit of $5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to the recognition of federal income tax credits. This had less than a one cent per share impact on EPS. Special items for 2002 are discussed in the attached financial tables. *Financial Measures Sprint provides readers financial measures generated using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect industry conventions, or standard measures of liquidity, profitability or performance commonly used by the investment community for comparability purposes. The financial measures used in this release include the following: Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is defined as operating income plus special items. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. Adjusted earnings per share or Adjusted loss per share is defined as diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations plus special items. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation, amortization and special items. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows. Free Cash Flow is defined as the change in cash and equivalents less the change in discontinued operations, debt, investment in debt securities and other financing activities, net. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a
substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows. Net Debt is consolidated debt, including current maturities, and equity unit notes, less cash and cash equivalents. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows. ARPU (Average monthly service revenue per user) is calculated by dividing wireless service revenues by weighted average monthly wireless subscribers. ARPU is used to measure revenue on a per user basis. This is a measure which uses GAAP as the basis for calculation. CCPU (Cash cost per user) is calculated by dividing costs of wireless service revenues, service delivery and other general and administrative costs by weighted average monthly wireless subscribers. CCPU is a measure analysts use to evaluate the cash costs to operate the business on a per user basis. This is a measure, which uses GAAP as the basis for calculation. Management is currently re-evaluating this metric relative to the guidance on non-GAAP measures. If the ultimate result of that re-evaluation finds CCPU to be a non-GAAP measure, Sprint will no longer provide the metric in its public discussions. CPGA (Cost per gross addition) is calculated by dividing the costs of acquiring a new wireless subscriber, including equipment subsidies, marketing costs and selling expenses, by gross additional subscribers. Management uses this metric to provide comparison of the efficiency and effectiveness of Sprint's sales and marketing efforts against our competitors. Analysts use this measure primarily to determine the value of a new customer. This metric used in conjunction with the other measures is the basis for evaluating the profitability of the operation. This is a measure which uses GAAP as the basis for calculation. Management is currently re-evaluating this metric relative to the guidance on non-GAAP measures. If the ultimate result of that re-evaluation finds CPGA to be a non-GAAP measure, Sprint will no longer provide the metric in its public discussions.

Sprint Corporation FOOTNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (1) In the 2003 fourth quarter, Sprint determined its liability for medical coverage for participants in the long-term disability plan was understated for costs incurred in periods prior to 2003. The expense, properly recorded in each of the respective prior periods, would have had an immaterial decrease in both income from continuing operations and earnings per share in the FON Group, and would have had an immaterial increase in the loss from continuing operations and loss per share in the PCS Group. As the impact to prior years' annual financial statements was not material, Sprint recorded an additional $114 million of expense in the 2003 fourth quarter to reflect the appropriate estimate of liability as of December 31, 2003. The FON Group recorded $105 million of this charge resulting in a reduction of income from continuing operations of $66 million, or $0.07 per share. The remaining $9 million was recorded by the PCS Group, which increased loss from continuing operations by $6 million, or $0.01 per share. Also in the 2003 fourth quarter, the FON Group recognized a $50 million pre-tax benefit to bad debt expense as a result of the settlement of accounts receivable claims with MCI (WorldCom) that had previously been fully reserved. This settlement increased income from continuing operations by $31 million, or $0.03 per share. In the 2003 second quarter, Sprint recorded charges of $36 million in connection with the separation agreements agreed to by Sprint and three former executive officers. This included a $15 million non-cash charge associated with accounting for modifications to certain terms of stock options granted in prior periods. The charge to the FON Group was $17 million, which decreased FON Group's income from continuing operations by $10 million, or $0.01 per share. The charge to the PCS Group was $19 million, which increased the PCS Group's loss from continuing operations by $12 million, or $0.01 per share. In the 2002 third quarter, Sprint recorded a charge to bad debt expense in connection with the bankruptcy declaration of WorldCom, which reduced operating income by $36 million and income from continuing operations by $23 million. The charge to the FON Group was $30 million, which reduced income from continuing operations by $19 million, or $0.02 per share. The charge to the PCS Group was $6 million, which increased loss from continuing operations by $4 million with no per share impact. (2) In the 2003 fourth quarter, Sprint recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments aggregating $370 million, which reduced income from continuing operations by $233 million. The FON Group recorded net restructuring charges of $52 million representing severance costs associated with Sprint's transformation to a customer-focused organizational design, additional facilities and severance charges associated the termination of the Web Hosting business, and the finalization of all 2001 and 2002 restructuring liabilities. Additionally, the FON Group recorded a $5 million impairment for the termination of software development projects, which was offset by a favorable adjustment of $39 million related to previously recognized Web Hosting and high-speed data impairments. These net charges resulted in a reduction of FON Group income from continuing operations of $11 million, or $0.01 per share. The PCS Group recorded net restructuring charges of $13 million for severance costs associated with Sprint's transformation to a customer-focused organizational design, contractual obligations related to the terminated development of a new billing platform and the finalization of all 2001 and 2002 restructuring liabilities. The PCS Group also recorded asset impairments of $339 million related to the terminated development of a new billing platform. These net charges increased PCS Group loss from continuing operations by $222 million, or $0.21 per share, and $0.22 per share in the year-to-date period. In the 2003 year-to-date period, Sprint recorded restructuring charges and asset impairments aggregating $2.0 billion, which reduced income from continuing operations by $1.2 billion. In addition to the 2003 fourth quarter charges noted above, the FON Group recorded restructuring charges of $13 million associated with facilities and severance cost related to the termination of the Web Hosting business. Asset impairment charges of $1.6 billion were associated with the revaluation of the FON Group's MMDS spectrum to fair value and impairment charges associated with the termination of the Web Hosting business. For the 2003 year-to-date period, FON Group restructuring and asset impairment charges totaled $1.6 billion, which reduced income from continuing operations by $1.0 billion, or $1.11 per share. In addition to the 2003 fourth quarter charges, the PCS Group recorded a $10 million asset impairment related to the termination of a software development project, which increased loss from continuing operations by $6 million, and had no per share impact. In the 2002 fourth quarter, Sprint recorded restructuring charges and asset impairments aggregating $245 million, which reduced income from continuing operations by $154 million. The FON Group recorded a restructuring charge of $111 million representing consolidations in Sprint's Network, Information Technology, and Billing and Accounts Receivable organizations, as well as additional steps to reduce overall operating costs. Additionally, the FON Group recorded a network asset impairment related to the Global Markets Division of $14 million. These charges reduced income from continuing operations by $78 million, or $0.09 per share. The PCS Group recorded a restructuring charge of $78 million representing the consolidations in Sprint's Network, Information Technology, and Billing and Accounts Receivable organizations, as well as additional steps to reduce overall operating costs. Additionally, the PCS Group recorded an asset impairment of $42 million representing abandoned projects. These charges increased loss from continuing operations by $76 million, or $0.07 per share. In the 2002 year-to-date period, Sprint recorded restructuring charges and asset impairments aggregating $389 million. In addition to the 2002 fourth quarter charges noted above, the FON Group recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of $202 million representing the termination of high-speed data services, as well as additional steps to reduce operating costs. The charge was partially offset by a $76 million adjustment to finalize the 2001 restructuring charge. For the 2002 year-to-date period, FON Group restructuring and asset impairment charges were $251 million, which reduced income from continuing operations by $157 million, or $0.18 per share. In addition to the 2002 fourth quarter items, the PCS Group recorded a $23 million restructuring charge representing the closing of five PCS call centers. This charge was offset by favorable accounting true-ups. Additionally, the PCS Group recorded a $5 million favorable adjustment to finalize the 2001 restructuring charge.

SPRINT CORPORATION FOOTNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (3) In the 2003 first quarter, the FON Group recorded a $19 million charge reflecting the premiums paid on a debt tender offer. In the 2003 third quarter, an additional $2 million premium was recorded primarily reflecting the early retirement of local division debt.

In the 2002 fourth quarter, the FON Group recorded a $4 million benefit associated with the repayment of debt prior to scheduled maturity, which increased income from continuing operations by $3 million, with no per share impact.

The FON Group and the PCS Group each recorded $9 million of the fourth quarter recovery, which increased each group's income from continuing operations by $6 million, or $0.01 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2003 Sprint attributed $7 million of the net charge to the FON Group, which decreased income from continuing operations by $4 million with no per share impact. The remaining net charge of $8 million was attributed to the PCS Group, which increased loss from continuing operations by $5 million with no per share impact. In the 2002 second quarter, the FON Group recorded in Other income (expense), net, charges of $201 million, which reduced income from continuing operations by $216 million, or $0.24 per share. These amounts included a gain from the sale of customer contracts for $40 million with an impact to income from continuing operations of $25 million, or $0.03 per share. Also included is a write-down of an investment due to declining market value of $241 million with the same impact on income from continuing operations, or $0.27 per share. In the 2002 third quarter, the PCS Group recorded to Other income (expense), net, a gain on the sale of an equity method investment of $67 million with the same impact on loss from continuing operations, or $0.07 per share. (5) In the 2003 fourth quarter, Sprint recognized a tax benefit of $49 million for recognition of certain federal and state income tax credits relating to various taxing jurisdictions and the cumulative impact of changes in state tax apportionments. The benefit to the FON Group was $44 million, or $0.05 per share. The benefit to the PCS Group was $5 million, with less than $0.01 per share impact. In the 2002 third quarter, Sprint recognized a tax benefit related to the capital losses not previously recognized of $292 million. The benefit to the FON Group was $235 million, or $0.26 per share.

Donnelley. Activity in subsequent quarters relates to final settlement activity of the sale. (7) Sprint adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations on January 1, 2003. In the FON Group, the local division historically accrued costs of removal in its depreciation reserves consistent with industry practice. These costs of removal do not meet the SFAS No. 143 definition of an asset retirement obligation. Accordingly, the FON Group recorded a credit of $420 million to remove the accumulated excess cost of removal resulting in a favorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $258 million, net of tax. The ongoing impact of this accounting change is expected to increase FON Group's net income through reduced depreciation expense by less than $15 million annually. (8) As the effects of including the incremental shares associated with options, restricted stock units and ESPP shares are antidilutive, both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share reflect the same calculation in these consolidated statements of operations for the PCS Group. (9) As the effects of including the incremental shares associated with options, restricted stock units and ESPP shares are antidilutive, they are not included in the weighted average common shares outstanding for the PCS Group.
