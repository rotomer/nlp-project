Exhibit 99 Media Contacts: Bill White, 913-794-1099 bill.white@mail.sprint.com Mark Bonavia, 913-794-1088 mark.bonavia@mail.sprint.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Sprint to Recombine Tracking Stocks and Return to Single Common Stock OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - Feb. 29, 2004 - Sprint (NYSE: FON and PCS) announced today that its board of directors has decided to recombine the company's "tracking stocks" and return to a single common stock. As a result, the PCS common stock will be eliminated and each share of PCS common stock will convert automatically into .50 shares of FON common stock on April 23, 2004. In the board's view, the recombination will: o Facilitate Sprint's transformation into a company focused on the needs of two customer types - business and consumer - by removing barriers to its ability to target more effectively its customers with a full suite of integrated products and services. o More closely align Sprint's capital structure with the company's evolving integrated operational focus in view of increased convergence of wireless and wireline offerings throughout the telecommunications industry. o Maintain investor understanding of Sprint's capital structure and financial performance and assure continued clarity of Sprint's financial reporting. The Sprint board, working with financial and legal advisors, followed a rigorous process and conducted a thorough analysis of financial, operational, structural and strategic factors before reaching the decision to recombine the stocks. The board and its capital stock committee, comprised of independent directors, also conducted extensive analyses to determine a conversion ratio fair to the holders of the PCS common stock and the FON common stock, each taken as a separate class.
-2- The Sprint board expects to declare the regular dividend of 12.5 cents per share on all outstanding shares of FON common stock, including those issued in the recombination, at its meeting in April 2004, payable to shareholders of record on a date in June 2004. As in the past, the Sprint board will continue to make its dividend decisions on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Background Sprint created the tracking stocks in 1998 in connection with its acquisition of 100 percent ownership of Sprint PCS. Although Sprint created two tracking stocks, it has remained a single corporation with a single board of directors. The FON shares that will be held following the recombination will not be a tracking stock, but instead will reflect the financial results and economic value of all of Sprint's operations. As of Feb. 26, 2004, there were approximately 1,036,400,000 shares of PCS common stock outstanding and approximately 906,200,000 shares of FON common stock outstanding. Using the numbers above, following the recombination there will be approximately 1,424,400,000 shares of FON common stock outstanding. Current holders of PCS common stock, FON common stock and securities convertible into PCS stock will receive a written notice explaining the recombination in greater detail. A copy of the notice is also available at http://www.sprint.com/sprint/ir/. PCS shareholders will receive cash for any fractional shares of FON common stock resulting from the recombination. Holders of PCS common stock, FON common stock and securities convertible into PCS stock will not recognize income, gain or loss as a result of the recombination, except with respect to cash received by holders of PCS common stock in lieu of fractional shares of FON common stock. There are no regulatory approvals or other conditions that must be satisfied prior to the recombination becoming effective. As provided in the company's articles of incorporation, there is no shareholder vote on the recombination. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," Sprint expects to recognize approximately $55 million of non-cash pre-tax expense in 2004 and approximately $45 million in 2005 related to the conversion of PCS stock options into FON stock options. This expense recognition primarily reflects application of stock option expensing to PCS stock options granted before Jan. 1, 2003. Lehman Brothers Inc. acted as the financial advisor to the board and to its capital stock committee. Updated Financial Profile Sprint reported GAAP consolidated loss from continuing operations of $367 million for the full-
-3- year 2003 and GAAP consolidated income from continuing operations of $471 million for the full-year 2002. Excluding special items, Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations* would have been $904 million for the full-year 2003 and $581 million for the full-year 2002. Assuming the recombination of Sprint's equities had occurred as of Dec. 31, 2001 at an identical conversion ratio, pro-forma GAAP loss per share from continuing operations would have been 27 cents for full-year 2003 and pro-forma GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations would have been 32 cents for full-year 2002. Adjusted for special items, pro forma full-year Adjusted Earnings Per Share* would have been 63 cents for 2003 and 40 cents for full-year 2002. Sprint provided FON Group and PCS Group financial guidance in a press release on Feb. 4, 2004. In light of today's announcement we are issuing consolidated guidance to reflect the new stock structure. The targets for consolidated operations are presented on a pro forma basis assuming the combination of Sprint equities had occurred as of Dec. 31, 2003, except for Free Cash Flow* which reflects three quarters of dividends for the recombined stock and one quarter of dividends for the FON tracking stock in 2004 and four quarters of dividends for the recombined stock in 2005. Consolidated targets incorporate the additional stock option expenses noted above and advisory fees associated with the recombination. These fees are expected to be dilutive to 2004 EPS by less than one cent per share. We are reiterating our previous targets for revenue growth, Adjusted Operating Income*, Adjusted EBITDA* and capital spending for our three reporting segments - the local division, the global markets division and the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. Consolidated targets o Total net operating revenue growth of 2 to 3 percent in 2004. o Adjusted Operating Income* in a range of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion in 2004. o Adjusted EBITDA* in a range of $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion in 2004 and mid to high single digit growth for the full year 2005. o Adjusted EPS* in a range of 70 cents to 75 cents in 2004 and $1.05 to $1.15 in 2005. These estimates assume average outstanding FON shares on a diluted basis of approximately 1.47 billion in 2004 and 1.49 billion in 2005. o Free Cash Flow* of approximately $1.8 billion in 2004 and $2.9 billion in 2005. o Capital expenditures of $4.0 billion in 2004 and 2005. Sprint will host a conference call with investors on Friday, March 5, 2004, to discuss the recombination. Presentation materials and directions on how to access the call will be available at http://www.sprint.com/sprint/ir/ starting Tuesday, March 2, 2004.
-4- -5- Description of Special Items The difference between Sprint Corporation's reported income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations* and reported EPS and Adjusted EPS*, is the result of the following special items in 2003: o Discontinued operation - reflects the operational activity and gain on sale of Sprint's directory publishing business. o Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle - a pre-tax gain of $420 million was recorded upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. o Restructuring and asset impairments - net pre-tax charges of $1,951 million were recorded primarily related to a revaluation of the fair value of Sprint's MMDS spectrum, the decision to wind down Sprint's Web Hosting business, the termination of the development of a new billing platform, severance costs associated with Sprint's transformation to a customer-focused organizational design and the termination of other software development projects. Charges from these actions were partially offset by true-ups related to the finalization of Sprint's 2001 and 2002 restructuring activities. o Executive separation agreements - a pre-tax charge of $36 million was recorded for charges associated with executive separation agreements. o WorldCom bad debt - a pre-tax benefit of $50 million was recorded as a result of a bankruptcy settlement reached with MCI (WorldCom). o Long-term disability - a pre-tax charge of $114 million was recorded after determining an understatement of costs for medical coverage for participants in the long-term disability plan occurred in periods before 2003. o Shareholder litigation charge - a net pre-tax charge of $15 million was recorded for a shareholder litigation settlement, net of related insurance settlements. o Premium on early retirement of debt - pre-tax charges of $21 million were recorded related to the early retirement of long-term debt. o Tax benefits - tax benefits of $49 million were recorded related to the recognition of certain federal and state income tax credits and the cumulative impact of changes in state income tax apportionments. The difference between Sprint Corporation's reported income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations* and reported EPS and Adjusted EPS*, is the result of the following special items in 2002: o Restructuring and asset impairments - pre-tax charges of $389 million were recorded primarily related to the termination of high-speed data services, Sprint's consolidation of Network, Information Technology, Billing and Accounts Receivable organizations, the closing of five customer solution centers, efforts to create a more competitive cost structure, as well as an asset impairment for abandoned projects. Charges from these actions were partially offset by an adjustment to finalize a prior year restructuring charge and favorable accounting true-ups. o WorldCom bad debt - a pre-tax charge of $36 million was recorded related to the expected loss on receivables due to WorldCom's bankruptcy declaration. o Tax benefit - a tax benefit of $292 million was recorded related to capital losses that were previously not recognizable.
-6- o EarthLink impairment - a pre-tax charge of $241 million was recorded due to declining market value. o Sale of customer contracts - a pre-tax gain of $40 million was recorded related to the sale of customer contracts. o Pegaso sale - a pre-tax gain of $67 million was recorded related to the sale of the investment in Pegaso. *Financial Measures Sprint provides our readers financial measures generated using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP).
