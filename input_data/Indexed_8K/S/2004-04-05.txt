Plaintiffs Withdraw Request for Injunction in the Recombination Lawsuits Against Sprint Media Contact: Mark Bonavia, 913-794-1088 mark.bonavia@mail.sprint.com OVERLAND PARK, Kan.-- April 05, 2004 Sprint has been advised of the plaintiffs' decision to withdraw their request for a preliminary injunction in the lawsuits related to the recombination of the company's PCS and FON tracking stocks.

As a result, the PCS common stock will be eliminated and each share of PCS common stock will convert automatically into .50 shares of FON common stock on April 23, 2004.
