[Sprint Logo] Exhibit 99 Investor Update 1Q 2004 Sprint Reports First Quarter Results o Strong revenue and operating income performance drives growth in income from continuing operations o Solid wireless and DSL customer gains o Significant growth in wireless data customers and revenues OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - April 20, 2004: The Sprint FON Group (NYSE: FON) is comprised of Sprint's global markets division, local division and other businesses consisting primarily of wholesale distribution of telecommunications products. The Sprint PCS Group (NYSE: PCS) consists of Sprint's mobile wireless operations. On April 23, 2004, Sprint will recombine its two tracking stocks, and each share of PCS stock will automatically convert into 0.5 shares of FON stock. As of April 23, 2004, the FON Group and the PCS Group will no longer exist, and FON stock will represent all of the operations and net assets of Sprint, including the global markets division, the local division and the PCS wireless division. Sprint today announced first quarter 2004 financial results. The results include strong revenue and operating income performance, strong cash flow production, excellent operational performance including solid gains in wireless and DSL customers, and significant growth in wireless data customers and revenues. Under Sprint's tracking stock structure, fully diluted Earnings per share from continuing operations for the FON Group in the first quarter was 34 cents compared to 31 cents in the first quarter of 2003. Before special items, FON Group's Adjusted EPS* was 36 cents versus 34 cents in the year-ago period, a 6% increase. The PCS Group reported a loss from continuing operations of 9 cents per share for the first quarter, compared to a loss of 18 cents per share in the first quarter of 2003. Before special items, the PCS Group reported an 8 cent Adjusted loss per share* versus a 16 cent loss in the year-ago period, a 50% improvement. Assuming the recombination of the tracking stocks occurred at the beginning of 2003 at the same conversion ratio, Sprint's pro forma consolidated Earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2004 was 15 cents compared to 7 cents per share in the first quarter of 2003. Before special items, Sprint's pro forma Adjusted EPS* was 17 cents versus 10 cents in the year-ago period, a 70% increase. In the quarter, Sprint's total net operating revenues increased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2003; total Adjusted Operating Income* was up 21%; total Adjusted EBITDA* increased 7%; and first quarter Free Cash Flow* totaled $242 million. Free Cash Flow* in the quarter is net of a $300 million contribution to Sprint's employee pension fund. 1
In the quarter, each of Sprint's business units contributed to the solid overall performance. The PCS wireless division reported strong financial results and added 972,000 customers, consisting of 414,000 net direct customer additions combined with 558,000 from wholesale and affiliate partners. PCS also built on its data leadership adding one million new Sprint PCS VisionSM subscribers. Annualized data revenues were $713 million, a 32 percent improvement from the fourth quarter. The local division delivered steady financial performance including solid cash production, and added a record 45,000 DSL subscribers, driving a 13% year-over-year improvement in data revenues. Despite a challenging operating environment, the global markets division reported revenue performance that is expected to exceed top-line results for major backbone competitors, a year-over-year gain in operating income, and Adjusted EBITDA* that exceeded capital expenditures by nearly $290 million. "In the first quarter, Sprint demonstrated the strength of our transformed business," said Gary Forsee, Sprint chairman and chief executive officer. "We have widened our industry lead in wireless data, we have aggressively added customers in DSL, and we added game-changing alliances that will help grow the scale of our operations and improve our customer experience." "I am very encouraged that our associates have been able to jump start our new organization and a new year," Forsee added. "We clearly have a solid footing for strong performance throughout 2004." First quarter consolidated net operating revenues were $6.7 billion, compared to $6.3 billion in the same period last year. Net income for the first quarter was $222 million versus net income of $1.67 billion for the same period last year which included a gain of $1.31 billion from a discontinued operation and a cumulative effect of change in accounting of $258 million. Operating income was $714 million in the first quarter compared with operating income of $604 million a year ago. Adjusted Operating Income* was up 21% to $744 million this quarter, compared with $614 million a year ago. At March 31, cash on hand was $2.7 billion as Sprint continues to track well against its planned net debt reduction. In the quarter, Net Debt* was cut by $296 million and now stands at $16.4 billion. The difference between reported Sprint operating income and Adjusted operating income* is the result of a pre-tax charge of $30 million recorded in the first quarter of 2004 primarily related to severance costs associated with Sprint's transformation and Web Hosting. A pre-tax charge of $10 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 associated with the termination of a software development project. The difference between reported income from continuing operations and Adjusted income from continuing operations* includes the impacts of these charges, as well as the following additional special items: o Shareholder litigation charge - a pre-tax charge of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 for a shareholder litigation settlement. 2
o Premium on early retirement of debt - a pre-tax charge of $19 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of approximately $1.1 billion of long-term debt. Additionally, Sprint reported two items below the continuing operations line in the first quarter of 2003: o Discontinued operation - reflects the operational activity and gain on sale of Sprint's directory publishing business. o Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle - reflects a pre-tax gain of $420 million recorded upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. o First quarter net subscriber additions include 414,000 post-paid retail, 420,000 from wholesale channels and 138,000 from affiliates. At the end of the period, PCS wireless was serving a total of 21.3 million customers, consisting of 16.3 million direct, 3.0 million affiliates and 2.0 million wholesale. o In the first quarter, direct gross customer additions and net additions grew sequentially from the fourth quarter. Direct gross customer additions were 1.8 million in the quarter, a more than 14% year-over-year increase. o Net operating revenues were up nearly 17% year-over-year. Service revenues increased 14%. o First quarter Adjusted Operating Income* was $261 million, an increase of 74% compared to $150 million in the year-ago period. In the 2003 fourth quarter, Adjusted Operating Income* was $237 million. o Adjusted EBITDA* in the first quarter was $915 million, a 21% improvement from $758 million a year ago. o Average monthly service revenue per user (ARPU)* was $61 in the first quarter compared to $59 in the year-ago period. During the quarter, average customer usage was approximately 15 hours per month. o Churn was 2.9% this quarter compared to 3.1% reported a year ago, and 2.7% in the 2003 fourth quarter. At the end of the period more than six million customers were subscribing to Sprint PCS data services, including more than four million Sprint PCS Vision customers. For the full quarter, data contributed just over 6% to overall ARPU*. Total first quarter operating expenses increased 13% compared to the year-ago period. The increase was driven by sales and distribution costs resulting from higher additions. Equipment costs also increased due to higher gross additions and handset upgrades, as well as a decline in availability of refurbished handsets for use in equipment replacement programs. The PCS wireless division continues to enhance growth potential through strategic alliances. These alliances leverage Sprint's network assets and expand its sales channels. In total, affiliates had their strongest showing for customer additions since the fourth quarter of 2002. The Virgin Mobile joint venture had strong performance in the quarter, and Qwest, a new wholesaler, began to add new customers in the quarter. 3
o First quarter revenues of $1.51 billion declined 2% from $1.53 billion in the year-ago period. o Adjusted EBITDA* was $728 million for the quarter compared to $727 million last year. o Adjusted Operating Income* was $460 million for the first quarter compared to $462 million a year ago. o The local division ended the quarter with nearly 350,000 DSL customers. o Total access lines declined 2.2% from the year-ago period. In addition to strong DSL growth, the local division continues to increase penetration of strategic products via bundled service offerings. During the quarter, switched access minutes of use and consumer long distance minutes of use both increased on a year-over-year basis. Total first quarter operating expenses decreased 1% compared to a year ago driven by a continued focus on expense reduction and operating efficiencies somewhat offset by a $14 million increase in post-retirement benefit expenses. Restructuring charges increased operating expenses by $14 million in the first quarter of 2004. o Net operating revenues declined nearly 7% to $1.91 billion from $2.05 billion a year ago. o Adjusted Operating Income* for the quarter was $23 million compared to $4 million in the year-ago period. o Adjusted EBITDA* was $343 million in the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period. In the quarter, total voice revenues decreased 8% from the year-ago period. Consumer voice revenues declined 21% while business voice revenues, including wholesale and affiliates, declined by nearly 5% from the year-ago period. Data revenues decreased 2% from the first quarter of 2003, and 2% sequentially. Frame Relay, ATM and Private Line services each grew modestly on a sequential basis. In the quarter, dedicated IP revenue rose 10% year-over-year and 8% from the fourth quarter of 2003, driven by gains in Global IP service. Overall IP revenues continue to be impacted by declining dial IP usage and Sprint's exit from the Web Hosting business. Total first quarter operating expenses declined 7% compared to the year-ago period. Initiatives to streamline processes, reduce access unit costs, rationalize the product portfolio, and lower bad debt expense continue to be the drivers behind the expense reductions. Restructuring charges increased operating expenses by $12 million in the first quarter of 2004. There were no special items in the first quarter of 2003. 4

Sprint Corporation FOOTNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (millions, except per share data) (1) In the 2004 first quarter, Sprint recorded a $30 million restructuring charge, which reduced income from continuing operations by $19 million. The FON Group recorded a charge of $26 million representing severance associated with Sprint's transformation to a customer-focused organizational design and the termination of the Web Hosting business. This charge reduced FON Group income from continuing operations by $17 million. The PCS Group recorded a charge of $4 million representing severance associated with Sprint's transformation to a customer-focused organizational design. This increased PCS Group loss from continuing operations by $2 million. In the 2003 first quarter, the PCS Group recorded a charge of $10 million associated with the termination of a software development project. This increased loss from continuing operations by $6 million. (2) In the 2003 first quarter, the FON Group recorded a $19 million charge reflecting the premiums paid on the early retirement of long-term debt. This decreased income from continuing operations by $12 million. (3) In the 2003 first quarter, Sprint recorded a $50 million aggregate charge to settle a securities class action and derivative lawsuit relating to the failed merger with WorldCom. The charge to the FON Group was $24 million which reduced income from continuing operations by $15 million. The charge to the PCS Group was $26 million which increased loss from continuing operations by $17 million. (4) In the 2003 first quarter, Sprint recorded an after-tax gain of $1.3 billion associated with the sale of its directory publishing business to R.H. Donnelley. (5) Sprint adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," on January 1, 2003. In the FON Group, the local division historically accrued costs of removal in its depreciation reserves consistent with industry practice. These costs of removal do not meet the SFAS No. 143 definition of an asset retirement obligation. Accordingly, the FON Group recorded a credit of $420 million to remove the accumulated excess cost of removal resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle credit of $258 million, net of tax. (6) As the effects of including the incremental shares associated with options and ESPP shares are antidilutive, both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share reflect the same calculation in these consolidated statements of operations of the PCS Group. (7) As the effects of including the incremental shares associated with options and ESPP shares are antidilutive, they are not included in the weighted average common shares outstanding for the PCS Group. 9
