[Sprint Logo] Exhibit 99 Investor Update 2Q 2004 Sprint Reports Second Quarter Results o Strong revenue, profit and free cash flow* performance o Continued momentum in wireless customer growth o 2004 full-year earnings guidance raised Overland Park, Kan. - July 21, 2004: In its initial financial report since returning to a single common stock structure, Sprint (NYSE: FON) today announced strong second quarter results. For the quarter, fully diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis were 16 cents versus break-even earnings in the second quarter of 2003. Adjusted EPS*, which removes the effects of special items, was 20 cents per share compared to 17 cents per share in the same period a year ago, an 18% improvement. Consolidated net operating revenues increased 6% compared to a year ago and 2% sequentially. In the quarter, both business and consumer solutions reported sequential growth of revenues, while local consumer solutions reported a small sequential decline. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA* in the quarter was $2.03 billion, a 1% increase from a year ago and a 2% increase sequentially. Consolidated Adjusted Operating Income* for the quarter increased 5% compared to the year-ago period, and 6% sequentially. Second quarter Free Cash Flow* totaled $692 million and year-to-date Free Cash Flow* was $934 million. The second quarter performance was driven by very strong results in Wireless and solid contributions from Local, partially offset by lower contributions from Long distance. "Sprint continues to successfully execute its transformation agenda," said Gary Forsee, Sprint chairman and chief executive officer. "Led by outstanding performance in Wireless which produced its first $1 billion quarterly Adjusted EBITDA*, we generated strong cash flows and improved our balance sheet. We achieved revenue growth in the second quarter that will likely lead other integrated telecom players. Additionally, we continued to implement actions that are enabling us to meet our previously announced goal of reducing annual operating expenses by more than $1 billion by the end of 2006. This consistent progress is the result of our unique nationwide wireless and wireline assets that offer integrated communication solutions to businesses and consumers and a customer-driven team that is producing a diversified and growing roster of satisfied users." Wireless posted year-over-year revenue growth of 17% and reported a 19% increase in Adjusted EBITDA*. In the quarter, ARPU* came in at a strong $62, a modest increase over both the year-ago period and the first quarter. PCS also continued to 1
achieve solid subscriber gains with the total base increasing by 897,000 subscribers in the quarter. The subscriber gains included 505,000 direct additions and 392,000 additions from our wholesale and affiliate partners. Sprint also acquired 91,000 subscribers from an affiliate during the quarter. This acquisition is not reflected in either direct or affiliate additions. Local reported steady revenues and solid profit margins while continuing to lead the industry in deploying next generation switching technology. Local also continues to lead in marketing bundled services. At quarter end, 54% of Local's residential customers were also using Sprint long-distance services and 45% were enrolled for a premium package of vertical services. Long distance reported a revenue decline of 7%, which is again expected to be well below the rate of decline reported by other backbone competitors. Although Long distance profitability was impacted by pricing pressures in the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA* exceeded capital spending by more than $190 million and year-to-date the excess is nearly $480 million. "Significant strategic steps were made in the second quarter to continue to invest in the future growth of our business," Forsee added. "We demonstrated our commitment to improving the fundamental relationship with our customers by introducing the Sprint PCS Fair & Flexible(sm) Plan, the wireless industry's first pricing plan that adjusts automatically to meet a customer's usage month-to-month while eliminating high overage charges. We unveiled plans to meet customers' demands for faster wireless data speeds and expand the possibilities of anywhere, anytime wireless access to information and entertainment with a significant capital commitment to the next generation of CDMA wireless technology. In our local markets, we continued to expand our DSL capabilities with more than 5 million of our 7.8 million local access lines now DSL ready. All of these areas represent significant opportunities for Sprint." Second quarter net operating revenues were $6.9 billion compared to $6.5 billion last year. Operating income for the second quarter was $707 million compared to $370 million a year ago. Adjusted Operating Income* as a percentage of net operating revenues was consistent year-over-year. Second quarter net income was $233 million compared to $7 million last year. In the second quarter, pension-related costs and stock-based compensation costs totaled $167 million versus $120 million in the year-ago period. Sprint produced strong cash flows in the second quarter. Debt was reduced by $1.1 billion during the quarter, and Sprint ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion. Net Debt* now stands at $15.6 billion. 2
Special Items The difference between reported Sprint operating income and Adjusted Operating Income* is primarily the result of a pre-tax charge of $96 million recorded in the second quarter of 2004 and $30 million in the first quarter of 2004 related to severance costs associated with Sprint's transformation initiatives and Web Hosting wind-down. Additionally, Sprint recorded a pre-tax benefit of $14 million in the second quarter of 2004 as a result of the final payment of a bankruptcy settlement reached with MCI (WorldCom). In 2003, pre-tax charges included $348 million associated with the Web Hosting wind-down, as well as $36 million associated with executive separation agreements, both recorded in the second quarter, and a $10 million charge in the first quarter associated with the termination of a software development project. The difference between reported income from continuing operations and Adjusted income from continuing operations* includes the impacts of the following additional special items: o Early retirement of debt - a pre-tax charge of $29 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2004 related to the early retirement of $750 million of equity unit notes. This consisted of a $20 million charge reflecting premiums paid and a $9 million recognition of deferred debt costs. A pre-tax charge of $19 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of approximately $1.1 billion of long-term debt. o Shareholder litigation charge - a pre-tax charge of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 for a shareholder litigation settlement. Finally, Sprint reported two items below the continuing operations line in the first quarter of 2003: o Discontinued operation - reflects the operational activity and gain on sale of Sprint's directory publishing business. o Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle - reflects a pre-tax gain of $420 million recorded upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. o Second quarter net subscriber additions include 505,000 direct, 299,000 from wholesale partners and 93,000 from affiliates. PCS also acquired 91,000 subscribers from an affiliate during the quarter. This acquisition is not reflected in either direct or affiliate additions. At the end of the period, there were a total of 22.2 million wireless subscribers, consisting of 16.9 million direct, 3.0 million affiliates and 2.3 million wholesale. o Direct gross additions were 1.67 million in the quarter, a 14% year-over-year increase. o Second quarter net operating revenues increased 17% compared to the year-ago period and increased 5% sequentially. o Second quarter Adjusted Operating Income* was up 48% from the year-ago period and 53% sequentially. o Adjusted EBITDA* was $1.07 billion, an increase of 19% from the second quarter of 2003 and 15% from the first quarter of 2004. o Average monthly service revenue per user (ARPU)* was $62 in the second quarter and in 3
the year-ago period, compared with $61 in the first quarter of 2004. o During the quarter, average subscriber usage was over 16 hours per month. o Churn was 2.3% this quarter compared to 2.4% a year ago, and 2.9% in the first quarter of 2004. At the end of the period, nearly 6.9 million subscribers were using Sprint PCS data services, including five million Sprint PCS Vision(sm) subscribers. For the full quarter, data contributed over 7% to overall ARPU*. On the operational side, there was notable improvement in customer retention in the second quarter as total churn declined by over 50 basis points sequentially. The decrease was due to reductions in both voluntary and involuntary turnover driven by improving satisfaction with network and customer service performance, proactive credit and collection efforts, and a growing percentage of customers under contract. In the quarter, PCS continued to enhance network coverage and increase capacity to meet growing demand. Capital spending totaled $667 million as Sprint continues to prioritize investments in signal density and coverage in competitive markets. Total second quarter operating expenses increased 13% compared to the year-ago period. The increases were primarily due to higher spending on sales and distribution associated with higher gross additions, the addition of new PCS stores, the initial costs associated with a new arrangement with our customer service co-sourcing provider, and increased marketing costs associated with the launch of the Sprint PCS Fair and Flexible Plan. In the quarter, Sprint added to a growing roster of wholesale MVNO partners by reaching new agreements with AT&T and others. Additionally, Qwest began to transition its customers to the Sprint network. o Second quarter revenues of $1.51 billion declined 1% from $1.53 billion in the year-ago period, but were essentially flat from the first quarter. o Adjusted EBITDA* was $718 million for the quarter compared to $732 million in the year-ago period and $728 million in the first quarter of 2004. o Adjusted Operating Income* was $447 million for the second quarter compared to $461 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $460 million in the first quarter of 2004. o Local added 34,000 new DSL customers in the quarter and ended the period with a total base of 383,000. o Total access lines declined 2.4% from the year-ago period. Revenues were stable in the quarter as growth in data services offset pressures on voice revenues. The 16% year-over-year growth in data is driven by a gain of 160,000 DSL subscribers over the past 12 months. The gain in DSL subscribers compares with a loss of 192,000 voice access lines in the same 12-month period. 4
Consumer long-distance minutes of use increased 28% year-over-year due to the unlimited long-distance product which now accounts for over 40% of total consumer long-distance minutes of use. In the residential market, penetration of strategic products rose 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2003, and now 68% of Local residential customers buy at least one strategic product in addition to basic telephone service. More than one third of the customer base uses at least two strategic products. Success is being driven by unlimited long-distance and DSL bundles which include a package of features. Local maintained strong margins as it continues to efficiently manage operating expenses. Total second quarter operating expenses decreased slightly less than 1% percent compared to the year-ago period driven by a continued focus on expense reduction and productivity improvements somewhat offset by a $14 million increase in post-retirement benefit expense. Restructuring charges increased operating expenses by $3 million in the second quarter of 2004. o Net operating revenues declined nearly 7% to $1.87 billion from $2.01 billion in the year-ago period and declined 2% sequentially. o Adjusted EBITDA* was $255 million in the quarter compared to $387 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $343 million in the first quarter of 2004. o Adjusted Operating Loss* was $66 million for the second quarter compared to income of $24 million in the year-ago period and income of $23 million in the first quarter of 2004. In the quarter, Sprint built on its extensive Long distance customer relationships to expand sales across its entire portfolio of products. Key wins include new integrated enterprise business relationships with the State of Texas, Overhead Door and Misys Healthcare Systems. In the quarter, total voice revenues decreased 6% from the year-ago period and 2% sequentially. Compared to the year-ago period, consumer voice revenues declined 15%, while business voice revenues, including wholesale and affiliates, 5
declined by 4%. The decline in consumer is mainly driven by lower volumes, while the business decline is due to lower pricing. Data revenues decreased 6% from the second quarter of 2003 and 3% sequentially. In the quarter, Frame Relay and Private Line services declined compared to both the year-ago period and sequentially, while ATM and Managed network services increased. In the quarter, dedicated IP revenues were flat year-over-year and declined 4% from the first quarter. Overall IP revenues continue to be impacted by declining dial IP usage and Sprint's exit from the Web Hosting business. Total second quarter operating expenses declined 14% compared to the year-ago period. The primary drivers of this decline included a change in the depreciable life associated with certain high-capacity transmission equipment, as well as lower restructuring charges quarter-over-quarter. Total restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2004 were $81 million compared to $348 million in the second quarter of 2003. Reported expenses were impacted by higher bad debt expense related to the wholesale market. Forward-looking Guidance Based upon second quarter results and current internal forecasts for the remainder of the year, Sprint is updating its financial guidance for 2004. This update supersedes all prior guidance for 2004. Our forecast assumes that PCS will continue to achieve a mid-teens share of gross wireless additions within our operating territories. We are making no changes to the 2005 consolidated guidance previously provided. Revenue We continue to expect consolidated net operating revenues for full year 2004 to increase 3% to 4% compared to full year 2003. Wireless revenues are now expected to grow at a solid double digit rate while Local revenues are expected to continue to decline at a low single digit rate and Long distance revenues now are expected to decline at a very high single digit rate. Adjusted EBITDA* Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA* is expected to be approximately $8.1 billion to $8.2 billion with PCS now contributing approximately $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, Local producing around $2.9 billion and Long distance now contributing approximately $1.1 billion. Adjusted Operating Income* Consolidated Adjusted Operating Income* is now expected to be $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion compared to previous guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion, with PCS now producing $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, Local contributing around $1.8 billion and Long distance now expecting to report a loss. Adjusted EPS* Full year Adjusted EPS* is now expected to be in a range of 74 cents to 78 cents per share compared to previous guidance of 70 cents to 75 cents per share. Free Cash Flow* and Capital Expenditures We continue to expect full-year Free Cash Flow* to be approximately $1.8 billion. We continue to expect capital spending to be approximately $4.0 billion, consisting of approximately $2.5 billion in Wireless, a little over $1.0 billion in Local and $350 million in Long distance. *Financial Measures Sprint provides readers financial measures generated using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect industry conventions, or standard measures of liquidity, profitability or performance commonly used by the investment community for comparability 6
purposes. Sprint provides reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures in its financial reporting. Because Sprint does not predict special items that might occur in the future, and our forecasts are developed at a level of detail different than that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures, Sprint does not provide reconciliations to GAAP of its forward-looking financial measures. The financial measures used in this release include the following: Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is defined as operating income plus special items. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. Adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations is defined as income or loss from continuing operations plus special items, net of tax. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. Adjusted earnings per share or Adjusted loss per share is defined as diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations plus special items. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income plus depreciation and special items. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows. Free Cash Flow is defined as the change in cash and equivalents less the change in discontinued operations, debt, investment in debt securities and other financing activities, net. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows. Net Debt is consolidated debt, including current maturities, and equity unit notes, less cash and cash equivalents. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statements of financial position and cash flows. ARPU (Average monthly service revenue per user) is calculated by dividing wireless service revenues by weighted average monthly wireless subscribers. ARPU is used to measure revenue on a per-user basis. This is a measure which uses GAAP as the basis for calculation.

Sprint Corporation FOOTNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (1) In the 2004 second quarter, Sprint recognized a $14 million pre-tax benefit to bad debt expense as a result of the final payment of the settlement of claims with MCI (WorldCom) that previously had been fully reserved. This settlement increased income from continuing operations by $9 million. In the 2003 second quarter, Sprint recorded charges of $36 million in connection with the separation agreements agreed to by Sprint and three former executive officers. This includes a $15 million non-cash charge associated with accounting for modifications to certain terms of stock options granted in prior periods. This charge reduced income from continuing operations by $22 million. (2) In the 2004 second quarter, Sprint recorded restructuring charges of $96 million associated with Sprint's transformation initiatives and the termination of the Web Hosting business. These charges reduced income from continuing operations by $58 million. In the 2004 year-to-date period, Sprint recorded $126 million in restructuring charges, which reduced income from continuing operations by $77 million. All year-to-date restructuring charges in 2004 were associated with Sprint's transformation initiatives and the termination of the Web Hosting business. In the 2003 second quarter, Sprint recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $348 million primarily related to winding down the Web Hosting business. This included a $337 million non-cash charge for the impairment of hosting assets and an $11 million charge related to cash requirements for employee terminations. The 2003 second quarter charge decreased income from continuing operations by $218 million. In the 2003 year-to-date period, Sprint recorded restructuring and asset impairments aggregating $358 million, which reduced income from continuing operations by $224 million. In addition to the 2003 second quarter charges noted above, Sprint recorded an asset impairment of $10 million associated with the termination of a software development project. (3) In the 2004 second quarter, Sprint recorded a $20 million charge reflecting premiums paid for the early retirement of $750 million of equity unit notes. In connection with this retirement, Sprint recognized $9 million of deferred debt costs in Other expense, net. These charges reduced income from continuing operations by $18 million. In the 2003 first quarter, Sprint recorded a $19 million charge related to the debt tender offer of approximately $1.1 billion of long term debt. This charge decreased income from continuing operations by $12 million. (4) In the 2003 first quarter, Sprint recorded a $50 million aggregate charge to settle a securities class action and derivative lawsuit relating to the failed merger with WorldCom. This charge reduced income from continuing operations by $32 million. (5) In the 2003 first quarter, Sprint recorded an after-tax gain of $1.3 billion associated with the sale of its directory publishing business to R.H. Donnelley. (6) Sprint adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, on January 1, 2003. Local historically accrued costs of removal in its depreciation reserves consistent with industry practice. These costs of removal do not meet the SFAS No. 143 definition of an asset retirement obligation. Accordingly, Sprint recorded a credit of $420 million to remove the accumulated excess cost of removal resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle credit of $258 million, net of tax. (7) New accounting guidance, EITF 03-6, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, requires that rights of securities to participate in the earnings of an enterprise must be reflected in the reporting of earnings per share. The equity unit securities, traded as SDE, qualify as "participating securities." The proportionate share of 2004 second quarter earnings attributable to these securities is being excluded from the earnings available to common shareholders. (8) As the effects of including the incremental shares associated with options, restricted stock units and ESPP shares are antidilutive in the 2003 quarter-to-date period, both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share reflect the same calculation in these Consolidated Statements of Operations for that period. (9) As the effects of including the incremental shares associated with options, restricted stock units and ESPP shares are antidilutive in the 2003 quarter-to-date period, they are not included in the weighted average common shares outstanding for that period. (10) On April 23, 2004, Sprint recombined its two tracking stocks. Each share of PCS common stock automatically converted into 0.5 shares of FON common stock. All per share amounts have been restated to reflect the recombination of the FON common stock and PCS common stock as of the earliest period presented at an identical conversion ratio (0.5). The conversion ratio was also applied to dilutive PCS securities (mainly stock options, ESPP, convertible preferred stock and restricted stock units) to determine diluted weighted average shares on a consolidated basis. 10
