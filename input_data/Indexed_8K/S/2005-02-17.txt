Sprint, on behalf of the applicable Contributors, may review and comment on the same within ten (10) business days after delivery thereof. (c) Where any discrepancy in the appropriate exhibits requires verification in the field the parties will provide adequate resources and personnel to resolve such discrepancy within ninety (90) days after the Initial Closing Date or Technical Closing Date, as applicable. 22
(d) If in the review of any Site Designation Supplement any party identifies any corrections that in such party's reasonable judgment necessitate further revisions to such Site Designation Supplement, the parties may at any party's request effect the correction of such Site Designation Supplement, and defer the recordation of such Site Designation Supplement until such revisions are made, for up to ninety (90) days following such request. (e) In addition, the parties will have the right to review and make corrections, if necessary, to any and all exhibits to the Site Designation Supplements after the applicable Closing. After making any such corrections, Lessee will re-record any such Site Designation Supplements to reflect such corrections, if requested by Contributors or Lessor or if elected by Lessee. SECTION 2.9 Prorating of Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in the Lease Agreement, as of the Initial Closing Date, prorations of expenses relating to the use, occupancy and operation of the Master Lease Sites and Pre-Lease Sites will be made on an accrual basis, with Contributors obligated for any payments, and entitled to any receivables, accrued prior to the Initial Closing Date and Lessee obligated for any payments, and entitled to any receivables, accrued on and subsequent to the Initial Closing Date. The net amount of the prorations set forth in this Section 2.9 will be credited to (or debited from) to the Rent and Pre-Lease Rent payable by Lessee at the Initial Closing and the parties will use good faith efforts to finalize and settle any other amounts due under this Section 2.9 within sixty (60) days following the Initial Closing Date. SECTION 2.10 Deposits. On the date of this Agreement, Lessee will deliver to Contributors the initial Deposit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Additional Deposits may be delivered to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 10.1(c). As provided in the Escrow Agreement, the Deposit will be invested in insured money market accounts, certificates of deposit, United States Treasury Bills or such other instruments as Lessee may instruct from time to time. At the Initial Closing, the Deposit, together with all earnings thereon, will be paid to Lessor (or Contributors on behalf of Lessor) and applied to the aggregate Rent and/or Pre-Lease Rent. SECTION 2.11 Re-Recordation. Whenever in this Agreement any party is required or has the right to record or re-record any document, including without limitation any Site Designation Supplement, Ground Lease or a memorandum of Ground Lease, such party will, or will cause the agent effecting such recordation to, deliver a copy of the document to the other party promptly after receipt of such notice, and in any event contemporaneously with its first delivery of such notice to the recording party. 23
ARTICLE 3 PRE-CLOSING PROCEDURES FOR SITES SECTION 3.1 Contributable Sites; Master Lease Sites. (a) If (i) there are no Contribution Exceptions with respect to a Site (other than any Excluded Site or Strategic Site), or (ii) all of the Contribution Exceptions with respect to a Site have been corrected or addressed pursuant to Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, then, except as otherwise provided in this Article 3, such Site will thereafter be deemed to be a "Contributable Site." (b) With respect to each Contributable Site, if (i) there are no Leasing Exceptions with respect to such Site, or (ii) all of the Leasing Exceptions with respect to such Site have been corrected or addressed pursuant to Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, then, except as otherwise provided in this Article 3, such Site will thereafter be deemed to be a "Master Lease Site." SECTION 3.2 Certain Procedures with respect to Identifying and Curing Exceptions. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Lessee will seek to identify all Exceptions with respect to each Site and any Shared Sites and to notify Sprint on behalf of Contributors thereof. Contributors and Sprint (and, following the Initial Closing, Lessor) will be actively involved and cooperate with Lessee in all material aspects of such efforts to identify all Exceptions and Shared Sites and will provide to Lessee in electronic form (or if requested by Lessee, hard copy) a list of Ground Lessor names and current addresses, a December 31, 2004 rent roll, and any other information in their possession with respect to the Sites that is reasonably requested by Lessee in connection with its review and analysis of the Sites and identification of the related Exceptions. In the event that the parties do not agree in good faith as to whether (or not) one or more Exceptions exist, they will work in good faith to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable and, if such dispute cannot be resolved any party may elect to proceed to arbitration as described in Section 3.5. (b) Lessee will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct or address any Exception identified pursuant to Section 3.2(a), including by obtaining Ground Lessor Estoppels with respect to the Leased Sites and Other Interest Sites, but without obligation to pay any costs, expenses or fees in respect thereof or related thereto; provided, however, that (i) Lessee will promptly notify Contributors in the event that any such costs, expenses or fees are requested or required and provide Contributors and, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor, the opportunity, in their sole discretion, to fund such costs, and (ii) each party will promptly notify others in the event that any Ground Lessor makes a claim or demand for a Shared Ground Lease Payment. It is understood and agreed that Lessee may contact Ground Lessors, Tower Subtenants and/or any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to identify and cure Exceptions including obtaining Ground Lessor Estoppels, whether in person or by 24
telephone, mail or other means of communication, and Contributors (for themselves and, after the Initial Closing, Lessor) hereby authorize such contacts. (c) Sprint, on behalf of Contributors and, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor, will use commercially reasonable efforts and will cooperate with Lessee in all efforts of Lessee to obtain Ground Lessor Estoppels and to cause any Exception to be cured, in each case, as promptly as practicable; provided that, none of Sprint, Contributors or Lessor will have any obligation to correct or address any Exception (other than by using the commercially reasonable efforts described herein). It is understood and agreed that in order to facilitate an organized process of addressing Exceptions, Contributors, Sprint and, after the Initial Closing, Lessor, will not, except at Lessee's request, initiate contact with Ground Lessors in order to address Exceptions or relating to Ground Lessor Estoppels and will agree upon talking points with Lessee for situations where such parties initiate contact with Contributors, Sprint or Lessor. (d) Upon cure of any Exceptions with respect to a Site, Lessee will provide written notice to Sprint on behalf of Contributors and, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor, identifying the Site together with related Exceptions and a brief statement regarding how such Exceptions were cured. If Contributors or, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor, do not object within ten (10) business days of receipt of such notice to the assertion by Lessee that such Exceptions have been cured and (i) if such Exceptions included all required Contribution Exceptions, and without any further action being required by the parties, such Site will automatically convert into a Contributable Site, and (ii) if such Exceptions included all required Leasing Exceptions and the Individual Site Closing Conditions have been satisfied or waived with respect to such Site, and without any further action being required by the parties, such Site will automatically convert into a Master Lease Site. All disputes over the method of cure with respect to an Exception will be resolved by arbitration as described in Section 3.5, it being agreed that the burden of proof will fall on Lessee to show that the Exception has been adequately cured by the method of cure indicated in Lessee's notice. (e) Lessee will provide to Sprint, on behalf of Contributors and, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor, written information in reasonable detail on a weekly basis with respect to the actions taken by Lessee pursuant to this Section 3.2 and any actions, waivers, consents or documents that Lessee is requesting from Contributors and Lessor with respect to the Exceptions. (f) Following the date hereof until the Initial Closing Date, Sprint, on behalf of Contributors and, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor, will (i) provide at its cost at least one employee to act as the primary contact for Lessee (and another employee if such primary employee contact is unavailable to assist Lessee) and to provide such employee sufficient resources and authority to assist Lessee in connection with the identification and curing of Exceptions in a timely manner and (ii) will respond as soon as practicable but in any event within five (5) business days, with respect to any actions, waivers, consents or documents that Lessee requests from Contributors or Lessor with respect to the identification and curing of Exceptions, including in connection with obtaining Ground Lessor Estoppels and Non-Disturbance Agreements. 25
(g) Each party will be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection with identifying and curing Exceptions as described above. (h) Nothing contained herein will be construed to prevent Lessee from seeking estoppels from Ground Lessors containing terms or provisions additional or varied to those in the Ground Lessor Estoppel, however no such additional terms will alter the form of Ground Lessor Estoppel for purposes of satisfying the requirements for Ground Lessor Estoppels under the definition of Financeable Site or Section 7.5 hereof. SECTION 3.3 Shared Sites; Contributors' Cure Rights. (a) Contributors will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Shared Site to be bifurcated but without obligation to pay any costs, expenses or fees in respect thereof or related thereto; provided, however, that if such Shared Site is not bifurcated prior to the Initial Closing Date in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Lessee, such Shared Site will be an Excluded Site hereunder. (b) With respect to each Site subject to an Exception not cured or waived pursuant to Section 3.2 above, Contributors may, in their sole discretion, but only upon written request of Lessee, elect any of the following options with respect to any such Exception: (i) Excluded Site. Contributors may elect, by written notice to Lessee given at any time within ten (10) business days prior to the Initial Closing Date, to exclude such Site from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such excluded Site, an "Excluded Site"); provided that there will be no more than fifty (50) Excluded Sites. If Contributors elect to designate a Site as an Excluded Site pursuant to this Section 3.3(b)(i), Lessee may, at any time prior to the Initial Closing, require Contributors to contribute their right, title and interest to the Leased Property of such Site to Lessor and cause Lessor to Lease the Leased Property of such Site to Lessee pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement; provided, that in such event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Contributors and Lessor will not be responsible for, and Lessee agrees to indemnify Contributors and Lessor from and against, any Liabilities resulting from or arising in connection with any Exceptions applicable to such Site and no such Exception will be considered when determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur. Subject to the preceding sentence, all references to any Site designated by Contributors as an Excluded Site in this Agreement and the Schedules or Exhibits attached to this Agreement will be deemed to have been deleted, all Exceptions related to such Excluded Site will no longer be Exceptions, and such Excluded Site will no longer be a "Site" to be operated or Leased pursuant to this Agreement and the Lease Agreement. (ii) Cure. Contributors and, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor may cure an Exception or Exceptions with respect to a Site in accordance 26
with the terms of this Section 3.3(b)(ii). An Exception will be deemed to have been cured by Contributors and/or Lessor: (1) Corrective Action - if, subject to Lessee's prior approval in its reasonable discretion, Contributors and/or Lessor will have taken corrective action with respect thereto (including, by way of example, by obtaining required consents or approvals from third parties, by acquiring rights or property from third parties, by obtaining or providing any affidavits or certificates, or otherwise) in such a manner as is reasonably acceptable to Lessee and, if applicable, Title Company; (2) Title Insurance - if such Exception relates solely to title, if Title Company will have committed to issue to the Lessee and its lenders, without indemnity from Lessee, a leasehold title insurance policy (or lender's policy, as applicable) (which policy is acceptable, including as to coverage amount, to Lessee in its reasonable discretion) without exception for such Exception (other than standard printed exceptions), or with affirmative coverage over such Exception; (3) Insurance - if Contributors or Lessor will have obtained insurance coverage (which coverage is acceptable to Lessee in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of Lessee and its lenders, which insures Lessee and its lenders against, or insures over, such Exception; or (4) Indemnification - (A) if Contributors, Sprint or Lessor, as requested and determined by Lessee, will have agreed to indemnify Lessee, to Lessee's satisfaction, against all Liabilities which may arise from such Exception (such indemnification not being subject to the limitations on Contributors' liability pursuant to Section 9.5), in which event such Liabilities will be deemed "Excluded Liabilities" hereunder, or (B) if the applicable Contributor or, after the Initial Closing, Lessor, will have agreed to cancel the Lease of the Leased Property of such Site and refund the applicable Rent for the Leased Property of such Site, or Pre-Lease Rent, as the case may be, in question within six (6) months after the applicable Technical Closing if the Exception is not cured pursuant to any of the other clauses of this Section 3.3(b) within such six (6) month period. (c) Contributors will be responsible for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Contributors relating to their cooperation and/or cure of Exceptions in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.3. SECTION 3.4 Certain Procedures with respect to Shared Ground Lease Payments. (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that it is the interest of each to establish on or prior to the Initial Closing whether or not any Shared Ground Lease Payments exist and, where possible, to quantify the same. As a result, Lessee will use 27
commercially reasonable efforts, concurrently with the addressing of Exceptions and the obtaining of Ground Lessor Estoppels to identify and resolve situations that could involve Shared Ground Lease Payments. (b) Sprint, on behalf of Contributors and, after the Initial Closing Date, Lessor, will use commercially reasonable efforts and will cooperate with Lessee in all efforts of Lessee to identify and resolve situations that could involve Shared Ground Lease Payments, in each case, as promptly as practicable and in any event will respond within five (5) business days with respect to any actions, waivers, consents or documents that Lessee requests from Contributors or Lessor; provided that, none of Sprint, Contributors or Lessor will have any right or obligation to directly resolve situations that could involve Shared Ground Lease Payments (other than by using the commercially reasonable efforts to assist Lessee as described herein). (c) Lessee may settle or compromise any claim or consent with respect to Shared Ground Lease Payments without the prior written consent of the Contributors, Lessor or Sprint whether before, at or after the applicable Closing Date. SECTION 3.5 Arbitration. If there is any dispute or controversy relating to this Article 3, Contributors (and, if after the Initial Closing, Lessor) or Lessee, as the case may be, will deliver to the other parties one or more written notices (a "Notice of Dispute") that will specify in reasonable detail the dispute that such party wishes to have resolved. If the parties are not able to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of each party's receipt of an applicable Notice of Dispute, within ten (10) days following the expiration of such 30-day period, the parties will initiate arbitration proceedings with an individual arbitrator mutually selected by the parties, each party acting reasonably. The arbitration will be held in Chicago, Illinois or such other location as is mutually agreeable to Contributors (and, if after the Initial Closing, Lessor) and Lessee. All arbitrations will be governed by the applicable commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") for accelerated arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator will prepare in writing, and provide to the parties, such arbitrator's determination, including factual findings and the reasons on which the determination was based. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, binding and conclusive and will not be subject to review or appeal and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the parties. SECTION 3.6 Special Zoning Sites. If prior to the Closing with respect to a Site, Contributors, Lessor or Lessee discover that a Site constitutes a Special Zoning Site, Contributors, Lessor or Lessee, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other parties that it considers such Site to be a Special Zoning Site, and provide reasonable specificity as to the reasons therefor. If such other parties do not object within ten (10) business days of receipt of such notice, such Site will be deemed to be a Special Zoning Site. All disputes concerning the designation of a Site as a Special Zoning Site will be resolved by arbitration as described in Section 3.5. If a Site is a Special Zoning Site, Lessee may, upon notice to Contributors and Lessor, attempt to remedy the circumstances therefor prior to the Final Closing Date. 28
If Lessee does not remedy such circumstances prior to the Final Closing Date, the provisions of Section 2.7(e) will apply. SECTION 3.7 Casualty Sites. If prior to the Initial Closing, Contributors or Lessee discover that a Site constitutes a Casualty Site, Contributors or Lessee, as the case may be, will promptly notify the other parties in writing that it considers such Site to be a Casualty Site, with reasonable specificity as to the reasons therefor. If such other parties do not object within ten (10) business days of receipt of such notice, such Site will be deemed to be a Casualty Site. All disputes concerning the designation of a Site as a Casualty Site will be resolved by arbitration as described in Section 3.5, it being agreed that the burden of proof will fall on the party asserting the existence of a Casualty Site. If a Site is deemed a Casualty Site, then: (a) Excluded Site. If such Site is a Casualty Site as a result of a condemnation (or pending condemnation) or a foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or similar proceeding involving a Ground Lessor Lien, any party may elect by written notice to others given at any time prior to the Initial Closing to exclude such Casualty Site from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such Casualty Site no longer being referred to as a Casualty Site and being referred to as an Excluded Site). If Contributors elect to designate a Site as an Excluded Site pursuant to this Section 3.7(a), Lessee may, at any time prior to the Final Closing Date with respect to any Site that does not contain any Sprint Collocation Space, require Contributors to contribute their right, title and interest in and to the Leased Property of such Site to Lessor and cause Lessor to Lease the Leased Property of such Site to Lessee pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement; provided, that in such event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Contributors and Lessor will not be responsible for, and Lessee agrees to indemnify Contributors and Lessor from and against, any Liabilities resulting from or arising in connection with the structure of such Site and no structural defects of such Site will be considered when determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur. Subject to the preceding sentence, all references to any Site designated by Contributors and/or, after the Initial Closing, Lessor as an Excluded Site in this Agreement and the Schedules or Exhibits attached to this Agreement will be deemed to have been deleted, and such Excluded Site will no longer be a "Site" to be Leased or operated by Lessee pursuant to this Agreement and the Lease Agreement. (b) Damaged Sites. With respect to Sites physically damaged by Force Majeure, Contributors may elect to repair the Tower prior to the Initial Closing Date so as to bring the condition of such Tower to substantially the same (or better) condition that it was in immediately prior to the event or occurrence of the event causing such Tower to be designated as a Casualty Site, or, in lieu thereof, if the Tower has not been so repaired by the Initial Closing Date, Contributors and/or Lessor may elect to pay or reimburse Lessee at the Initial Closing for the amount of the actual out-of-pocket costs incurred or to be incurred by Lessee to repair the Tower if the Tower has not been repaired by the Initial Closing in the manner described above or the amount estimated by Lessee in good faith to be required to so repair the Tower if the Tower has not been repaired by the Initial Closing. 29
With respect to each damaged Casualty Site, if Contributors and/or Lessor do not, or do not elect to, repair the Tower or pay Lessee to repair the Tower pursuant to this Section 3.7(b) prior to the Initial Closing, then, in each such case, such Casualty Site will be treated as an Excluded Site as if Contributors had elected to exclude such Casualty Site pursuant to Section 3.7(a) unless Lessee will elect to cause Lessor to Lease the Leased Property of such Site in accordance with Section 3.7(a). SECTION 3.8 Recordation of Documents; Signage. (a) Contributors acknowledge that Lessee will be permitted to undertake to record any Ground Lease, memorandum of Ground Lease, assignment of Ground Lease to Lessor, Ground Lessor Estoppels, Non-Disturbance Agreements and Site Designation Supplements. Lessee will deliver to Contributors written notice of such recordation with supporting documentation (the "Recordation Notice") (not more often than once per month) setting forth in reasonable detail the actual costs recording costs incurred by Lessee in connection with any such recordation. Within ten (10) business days following receipt of such invoices, Contributors will pay to Lessee an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of such actual costs incurred by Lessee as set forth in the Recordation Notice; provided, that the total amount of Contributors' reimbursement obligations set forth in this Section 3.8 will not exceed $1,325,000 in the aggregate. Contributors shall also pay one hundred percent (100%) of the actual recordation costs incurred by Lessee for recording Corrective Assignments, which shall also be set forth in the Recordation Notice, but the costs of recording the Corrective Assignments shall not be subject to the provisions of the prior sentence. (b) Contributors and Lessor will execute documents reasonably requested by Lessee to effect any such recordation and will cooperate with Lessee in pursuing such recordation (subject to the cost limitations in clause (a) above). (c) Lessee, after the applicable Closing with respect to a Site, will have the right to place, at its sole cost and expense, accurate signage on such Site to put third parties on notice of its interest in such Site, subject to compliance with applicable Laws and any Ground Lease for the Site in question. SECTION 3.9 Allocation of Rent and Pre-Lease Rent; Multiple Lease Agreements (a) On or before May 15, 2005, Contributors will cause to be delivered to Lessee, for Lessee's review and approval, a draft of Exhibit H to each Lease Agreement, which will set forth (i) the Rent and the Pre-Lease Rent for each Site based on the Rent and Pre-Lease Rent Allocation Principles, (ii) the Rent and the Pre-Lease Rent allocation under Section 467 of the Code to each year of the Term for each Site, based on a level allocation, (iii) the proportional Rent and Pre-Lease Rent under Section 467 for each year of the Term for each Site, (iv) the Section 467 loan balance for each year of the Term for each Site, (v) the Section 467 interest component for each year of the Term for each Site, and (vi) the Option Purchase Price for each Site based on the Option Purchase Price Allocation Principles; in each case based on financial information for the Sites through and including March 31, 2005. The parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate to 30
finalize Exhibit H to each Lease Agreement as soon as practicable, but in no event less than ten (10) days prior to the Initial Closing Date, which shall reflect valuation of the Sites as of the Initial Closing Date. Any disputes regarding the form of Lease Agreement, including the items described on Exhibit H, will be resolved by arbitration as described in Section 3.5; provided that the amounts determined by the appraisal and the choice of American Appraisal Associates as appraiser will not be subject to arbitration (it being understood and agreed that the process and cooperation requirements set forth in Exhibits D-1 and D-2 shall be subject to arbitration). If the aggregate Option Purchase Price for the 6,628 Sites currently listed on Exhibit A and B hereto, as determined by American Appraisal Associates and delivered in accordance with the Option Purchase Price Allocation Principles, shall exceed two billion five hundred fifty million dollars ($2,550,000,000), then (i) if the Option Purchase Price is equal to or greater than two billion five hundred fifty million dollars ($2,550,000,000), but less than two billion six hundred million dollars ($2,600,000,000), the aggregate Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall be reduced by one million eight hundred thousand dollars ($1,800,000); (ii) if the Option Purchase Price is equal to or greater than two billion six hundred million dollars ($2,600,000,000), but less than two billion six hundred fifty million dollars ($2,650,000,000), the aggregate Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall be reduced by three million six hundred thousand dollars ($3,600,000); (iii) if the Option Purchase Price is equal to or greater than two billion six hundred fifty million dollars ($2,650,000,000), but less than two billion seven hundred million dollars ($2,700,000,000), the aggregate Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall be reduced by five million four hundred thousand dollars ($5,400,000); (iv) if the Option Purchase Price is equal to or greater than two billion seven hundred million dollars ($2,700,000,000), but less than two billion eight hundred million dollars ($2,800,000,000), the aggregate Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall be reduced by nine million four hundred thousand dollars ($9,400,000); (v) if the Option Purchase Price is equal to or greater than two billion eight hundred million dollars ($2,800,000,000), but less than two billion nine hundred million dollars ($2,900,000,000), the aggregate Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall be reduced by thirteen million four hundred thousand dollars ($13,400,000); and (vi) if the Option Purchase Price is equal to or greater than two billion nine hundred million dollars ($2,900,000,000), but less than three billion dollars ($3,000,000,000), the aggregate Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall be reduced by seventeen million four hundred thousand dollars ($17,400,000). If the aggregate Rent and Pre-Lease Rent is so reduced at the Initial Closing, such reduction shall be allocated among the Rent and Pre-Lease Rent attributable to all of the Sites that are the subject of the Initial Closing, in accordance with the Rent and Pre-Lease Rent Allocation Principles. If the Option Purchase Price exceeds three billion dollars ($3,000,000,000), Lessee shall have the option to terminate this Agreement, and Escrow Agent shall return the Deposit, together with all earnings thereon, to Lessee. (b) Contributors may, on notice to Lessee, at least thirty (30) days prior to the Initial Closing, elect at Closing to enter into up to seven (7) separate Lease Agreements, each with a separate Lessor, and such notice shall set forth the Sites subject to each such Lease Agreement (which Sites shall be divided based on geography and not other factors), provided that (i) each Site will be leased or pre-leased under only one Lease Agreement, (ii) under each such Lease Agreement, the "Global Parent Maximum Obligation" (as defined therein) shall mean an amount equal to the product of (x) two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000) and (y) a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate sum of 31
the Rent and the Pre-Lease Rent for the Sites subject to such Lease Agreement and the denominator of which is the aggregate sum of the Rent and the Pre-Lease Rent for all Sites leased or pre-leased at the Closing, (iii) the obligations of "Sprint" and "Lessor" under, and as defined in, each Lease Agreement, respectively, may, at the election of Lessee be cross-defaulted with the obligations of "Sprint" and "Lessor" under the other Lease Agreements and (iv) any Collocation Agreements bifurcated so a Collocation Agreement does not cover any sites held by more than one Lessor, provided, however, if Contributors can demonstrate to Lessee a material economic reason for having additional Lease Agreements, and same does not cause material incremental costs to Lessee (which hardship Lessee shall describe to Contributors, by written notice, delivered at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Initial Closing Date), Contributors may enter into up to fifteen (15) Lease Agreements, each with a separate lessor, in accordance with the other provisions of this sentence. The Parties shall, in good faith, resolve any disputes under the prior sentence. Lessor and Lessee will agree in good faith upon the structure and components of each separate form of Lease Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules thereto.

From the date of this Agreement and until the Initial Closing (or the applicable Technical Closing with respect to Pre-Lease Sites) and except as contemplated by this Agreement or set forth in Section 6.4 of the Contributors Disclosure Letter, Contributors and their respective Affiliates will not, without the consent of Lessee (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed): (a) (i) sell, dispose of, transfer, lease or encumber the Leased Property of any of the Sites, other than (x) Permitted Encumbrances incurred or entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (y) conveyances that are immaterial with respect to the Leased Property of the affected Site, (ii) except in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, enter into, modify, accelerate, amend, or grant any waiver or release under any Material Agreement, including any Collocation Agreement (but in no event terminate or cancel any Material Agreement, or modify, accelerate, amend or grant any waiver or release with respect to any revenue sharing provisions in such agreements without the consent of Lessee), or (iii) accelerate 46
or delay collection of accounts receivable or payment of any account payable in advance of or beyond their regular due dates or the dates when the same would have been collected or paid, as applicable, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; provided that Contributors will provide prompt notice to Lessee of any such action described in this clause (a); (b) agree, so as to legally bind Lessee whether in writing or otherwise, to take any of the actions set forth in Section 6.4(a) and not otherwise permitted by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.4, nothing in this Agreement will be construed or interpreted to prevent Contributors in their sole discretion from (i) engaging in any activity with respect to any of its businesses other than the Collocation Business, (ii) taking any action with respect to the Leased Property of any Sites contemplated under Article 3, including, without limitation, designating a Site as an Excluded Site, (iii) removing Excluded Assets or Excluded Equipment from Leased Property of the Sites, or (iv) taking any action with respect to any Excluded Site or Strategic Site. SECTION 6.5 Public Announcements. Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the parties will not issue any report, statement or press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as in the reasonable judgment of a party that may be required by Law or by the rules of a national securities exchange, and in any event a party will use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party at a reasonable time in advance of such required disclosure. Within four (4) days of the date hereof, Sprint shall file with the SEC a form 8-K attaching thereto this Agreement and the form of Lease Agreement. SECTION 6.6 Corporate Names. (a) Lessee acknowledges that Sprint, Contributors and their respective Affiliates have, and will at all times have, the absolute and exclusive proprietary right to all Names incorporating "Sprint" by itself or in combination with any other Name, including, without limitation, the corporate design logo associated with "Sprint", and that none of the rights thereto or goodwill represented thereby or pertaining thereto are being Leased, or otherwise assigned or transferred, hereby or in connection herewith. Lessee agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to, use any Name, phrase or logo incorporating "Sprint" or such corporate design logo in or on any of its literature, sales materials, agreements or products or otherwise in connection with the sale of any products or services or in the operation of the Sites. (b) Sprint and Contributors acknowledge that Lessee and its Affiliates have, and will at all times have, the absolute and exclusive proprietary right to all Names incorporating "Global Signal" by itself or in combination with any other Name, including, without limitation, the corporate design logo associated with "Global Signal", and that none of the rights thereto or goodwill represented thereby or pertaining thereto are being 47
Leased, or otherwise assigned or transferred, hereby or in connection herewith. Lessee agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates, including Lessor, to, use any Name, phrase or logo incorporating "Global Signal" or such corporate design logo in or on any of its literature, sales materials, agreements or products or otherwise in connection with the sale of any products or services or in the operation of the Sites. SECTION 6.7 Actions by Lessee, Sprint and Contributors Subsidiaries. Lessee, Sprint and each Contributor will ensure that each of their respective Subsidiaries (if any) take all actions necessary to be taken by such Subsidiary in order to fulfill Lessee's, Sprint's or such Contributor's respective obligations under this Agreement. SECTION 6.8 Environmental Matters. (a) Lessee may commission, at Lessee's cost and expense, Phase I (and if permitted under the applicable Ground Lease, Phase II) environmental audits of all Sites. Contributors have heretofore made available and furnished to Lessee true, correct and complete copies of all Phase I and Phase II environmental assessments (including attachments, appendices, exhibits and schedules) and all other documents related to environmental matters, including without limitation, notices of violations, claims and correspondence with consultants and Governmental Authorities of the Sites that Contributors have been able to locate as of the date of this Agreement using their good faith efforts. Lessee will indemnify Contributors and Lessor and their respective Affiliates for any claims, losses or causes of action as a result of physical or tangible damages or injuries caused by, or incurred in connection with, Lessee's Phase I or Phase II environmental audits of any Site; provided, that Lessee will not indemnify Contributors or their respective Affiliates for any claim, loss or cause of action caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Contributor or such Affiliate or (ii) any physical condition existing on any Site prior to Lessee's or its agent's entry thereon (except for any incremental damage caused by Lessee or its agents with respect to any such physical condition). (b) Lessee will promptly provide (at Lessee's sole cost and expense) to Contributors and Lessor (i) the results of any and all environmental sampling and other analytical testing that may be conducted and (ii) any and all environmental reports (including the results of the aforementioned Phase I and, if applicable, Phase II reports) generated by Lessee as a result of these studies. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, neither any reports nor any information contained in said reports or otherwise generated by Lessee under this Agreement, will be released to any other party without the prior written consent of Lessee, Lessor and Contributors, except that either Lessee, Lessor or Contributors may release such reports to their respective Representatives or in connection with any merger or other corporate transaction of Lessee or any Contributor, or disposition of assets, that includes the Sites to which the reports apply (or Liability with respect thereto). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 or if any Site becomes an Excluded Site, Lessee will if requested by Contributors (x) turn over to Contributors (at Contributors' cost) all reports, documents, data and other writings and information, including copies and, if available, electronic format thereof, relating to any 48
and all investigations or studies conducted with respect to environmental conditions or compliance associated with such (or all, in the event of termination of this Agreement) Sites, and such reports, documents and/or writings will become the exclusive property of Contributors, provided that Contributors may not rely thereon and Lessee will have no obligations or liability with respect thereto, or (y) destroy such documentation and information in accordance with Section 6.12(d). SECTION 6.9 Title Insurance Commitments. If Lessee elects to purchase title insurance for a Site, Contributors and Lessee will work together and cooperate in order to obtain and cause to be delivered to Lessee (for Lessee's use for purposes of obtaining title insurance) as promptly as practicable following execution of this Agreement, copies of commitments (and will provide non-privileged copies (or electronic access) thereof to Contributors or Lessor) to issue leasehold and/or leasehold lenders title insurance policies ("Title Commitments") for each such Site as to which any Contributor has an insurable real property interest ("Insurable Sites"). The costs of obtaining the Title Commitments and title insurance policies pursuant to the Title Commitments (the "Title Policies") will be borne by Lessee (except as provided in Section 3.3(b)(ii)), and at the Closings, Lessee will reimburse Contributors for any out-of-pocket costs related thereto that were incurred and paid by Contributors at the request of Lessee. If, prior to the Initial Closing or Technical Closing, as the case may be, relating to any Insurable Site for which a Title Commitment will have been issued, Lessee will be unable to obtain a Title Policy (or a marked Title Commitment) insuring its interest and/or the interest of its lender in such Site (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances) notwithstanding Lessee's having exercised its commercially reasonable efforts to do so, then, provided that Lessee will continue to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Title Policy (or a marked Title Commitment), Lessee will have the right to treat such as a Pre-Lease Site. At each Closing Lessor or Contributors, as applicable, will deliver to Title Company such documents including Property Tax forms and any other certificates and documentation as may be reasonably and customarily required by the Title Company for issuance of owners' and lenders' policies of leasehold title insurance (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances) in favor of Lessee and/or Lessee's lenders. SECTION 6.10 Other Documentation. Prior to the Initial Closing, Contributors will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Lessee (a) copies of all written (and effective) Ground Leases, Collocation Agreements and material Governmental Approvals solely related to the Leased Property or, to the extent not solely related, appropriate extracts thereof, and (b) copies of, or extracts from, all current files and records of Contributors solely related to the ownership, occupancy or leasing of the Leased Property or, to the extent not so solely related, appropriate extracts thereof; provided, that (i) the failure to deliver any of the foregoing that is not located by Contributors after using good faith efforts to do so will not be considered a breach of this Agreement, (ii) Contributors will not be required to deliver to Lessee any privileged document, and (iii) Contributors will cooperate with Lessee in delivering such documents in electronic form in a manner to allow integration and compatibility with Lessee's systems. 49
SECTION 6.11 Master Collocation Agreements The parties acknowledge that certain Collocation Agreements permit a Tower Subtenant to occupy space (including on a Tower) at more than one Site (each a "Master Collocation Agreement"). At the Initial Closing and each Technical Closing in which the Leased Property of a Master Lease Site subject to a Master Collocation Agreement is Leased to Lessee and in which the Leased Property of some of the Sites applicable to such Master Collocation Agreement is retained by Contributors or Lessor, to the extent permitted under the applicable Master Collocation Agreement or consented to by the applicable counterparty, the applicable Master Collocation Agreement will be bifurcated into two separate Master Collocation Agreements, the first applicable to the Sites subject to the existing Master Collocation Agreement that are retained by Contributors or Lessor at the applicable Closing (under which the applicable Contributor or Lessor will remain the lessor) and the second applicable to the Master Lease Sites subject to the existing Master Collocation Agreement that are Leased to Lessee at the applicable Closing (under which Lessee will be the lessor). To the extent practicable, when requesting consent to a bifurcation, the parties will also request consent to a future further bifurcation of any such Master Collocation Agreement such that further severance thereof is possible in connection with any post-closing conversion of a Pre-Lease Site to a Master Lease Site as well as a future assignment (in whole or part) of Lessee's interests under the Lease Agreement in connection with a financing. Lessee, Lessor and Contributors will cooperate and each use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the terms of this Section 6.11. SECTION 6.12 Confidentiality. (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that in the course of their discussions and negotiations of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, a party to this Agreement (the "Disclosing Party") may already have disclosed or may hereafter disclose Confidential Information (as defined below) to one or more of the other parties to this Agreement (each, a "Disclosee"). Each party agrees that if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, it will either return to the Disclosing Party all written Confidential Information furnished to it or destroy such Confidential Information. Each party further agrees to maintain the confidentiality of any and all Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party and not disclose or give any Confidential Information to any Person or use such Confidential Information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements; provided, that the foregoing will not prohibit (i) use of such Confidential Information (A) as is required by Law, (B) as is necessary to prepare Tax Returns (including Tax Returns of Lessee, Contributors, Lessor or their respective Affiliates) or other filings with Governmental Authorities or to defend or object to any reassessment of Taxes, (C) as is necessary for Lessee, Contributors, Lessor or their respective Affiliates (or their representatives) to prepare and disclose, as may be required, accounting statements or (D) to assert or protect any rights of Lessee, Sprint, Contributors, Lessor or their respective Affiliates under this Agreement or under any applicable Law or (ii) disclosing to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal and state tax treatment and tax structure (tax structure will mean any fact that may be applicable to understanding the U.S. federal or state tax treatment of the 50
transaction) contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to Lessee, Sprint or Contributors or their respective Affiliates relating to such tax treatment and tax structure provided that no information will be disclosed that could waive the attorney-client privilege, the privilege under Section 7525 of the Internal Revenue Code, or other privileges. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party agrees that, when acting as a Disclosee, it may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those employees, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financial advisers and any representatives of such advisers (collectively, "Representatives") of Disclosee who require such information for the purposes contemplated under this Agreement; provided, that it must (i) notify all of its Representatives to whom Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party is disclosed not to use or disclose such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement, (ii) prevent use or disclosure by its Representatives of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, except as provided in this Agreement, and (iii) if requested or required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order. If, failing the entry of a protective order, the Disclosee is, in the opinion of its counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information, it may disclose that portion of the Confidential Information that its counsel advises that it is required to disclose and will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to that portion of the Confidential Information that is being disclosed. In any event, the Disclosee will not oppose action by the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. (b) For purposes of this Section 6.12, "Confidential Information" means any and all technical, business and other information regarding the business, finances, operations, products, services and customers of a party and its Affiliates, whether in written electronic, oral or any other form, which derives value from not being generally known to the public, including, without limitation, technical or nontechnical data, compositions, devices, methods, techniques, drawings, inventions, processes, financial data, financial plans, product plans, lists or information concerning actual or potential customers or suppliers, information regarding business plans and operations, methods and plans of operation, marketing strategies, and acquisition and investment plans together with the analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by the Disclosee using such information; provided, however, that the term "Confidential Information" will not include any information that (i) was in the possession of or known to the Disclosee without any obligation of confidentiality prior to receiving the information from the Disclosing Party, (ii) is, or subsequently becomes, legally and publicly available other than by breach of this Agreement, (iii) is obtained by the Disclosee without any obligation of confidentiality from a source other than the Disclosing Party and the applicable source is not in breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party or to any other party, or (iv) is developed by or for the non-disclosing party without the use of Confidential Information. (c) Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the databases respecting the Sites maintained on behalf of Contributors are owned by Contributors may contain trade 51
secrets of Contributors. Any data from such databases provided to Lessee may only be used by Lessee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 6.12. (d) Each party agrees that if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Initial Closing, then within fifteen (15) business days after being so requested by the Disclosing Party, the Disclosee will return or destroy (at its option) all documents thereof furnished by the Disclosing Party. Except to the extent the Disclosee is advised by counsel such destruction is prohibited by Law, the Disclosee will also destroy all written material, memoranda, notes, copies, excerpts and other writings or recordings whatsoever in its possession prepared by it or its Representatives based upon, containing or otherwise reflecting any Confidential Information. Any destruction of materials will be confirmed in writing by the Disclosee. Any Confidential Information that is not returned or destroyed, including, without limitation, any oral Confidential Information, will remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 6.12. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Lessee will not be required to destroy or return any Confidential Information related to any Leased Property of each Site converted into a Master Lease Site at a Closing following such Closing or to any Pre-Lease Site, (ii) following any Closing hereunder, Contributors and Sprint will be deemed to be the Disclosee and Lessee will be deemed to be the Disclosing Party with respect to all Confidential Information included in or related to the Leased Property of each Site converted into a Master Lease Site at each applicable Closing and to each Pre-Lease Site for all purposes under this Agreement and (iii) the Disclosee may retain one (1) archival copy of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information solely for the purpose of use, to the extent necessary, in the prosecution or defense of any litigation, dispute resolution, arbitration, mediation or as may be necessary, in the reasonable discretion of the Disclosee, for the reason of resolving any threatened litigation, dispute resolution, arbitration or mediation or other dispute. (e) Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Sprint Confidentiality Agreement will terminate automatically and will be of no further force or effect, except as expressly provided in the Confidentiality Agreement or the Sprint Confidentiality Agreement, respectively. (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.12 will be deemed to prohibit (i) any disclosure deemed by Lessee to be necessary or desirable in connection with curing or addressing any Exceptions or obtaining Ground Lessor Estoppels prior to the Initial Closing Date or (ii) from and after the Initial Closing, any use or disclosure of information relating to this Agreement, the Sites or the Leased Property as Lessee may deem necessary or desirable in connection with the operation of its business and the Sites (including, without limitation, in connection with any financing), except, in each case, with respect to those matters that Sprint reasonably has informed Lessee constitute Sprint's or Contributors' trade secrets (as defined by applicable Law), provided that any information related to the conduct or operation of the Collocation Business or the Sites will not constitute such trade secrets. SECTION 6.13 Lessee's Efforts. 52
(a) Lessee will promptly notify Contributors of any proposal by any of the institutions party to a Financing Commitment to withdraw, terminate or make a material change in the amount or terms of such Financing Commitment that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Lessee to consummate the financing contemplated by such Financing Commitment in accordance with its terms. In addition, upon Contributors' reasonable request, Lessee will advise and update Contributors, in a level of detail reasonably satisfactory to Contributors, with respect to the status, proposed closing date, and material terms of the Financing Commitments. Lessee will not consent to any amendment, modification or early termination of any Financing Commitment that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Lessee to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) Lessee will, and will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain the effectiveness of the Financing Commitments in accordance with their terms and obtain alternative financing if necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) enter into definitive documentation with respect to the Financing Commitments, or any alternative financing necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) satisfy all funding conditions to the Financing Commitments or any alternative financing set forth in the definitive documentation with respect to the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments, or alternative financing necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) consummate the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments (including by extension of the Financing Commitments on substantially equivalent or better terms) or, if the Financing Commitments expire, obtaining alternative financing in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amounts set forth in, and on terms substantially equivalent to or better than the terms of, the Financing Commitments. SECTION 6.14 Employee Matters. (a) At any time prior to the Initial Closing, Lessee may, or may cause an Affiliate to, make offers of employment to be effective as of the Initial Closing to all or certain employees of the Collocation Business (each employee who accepts Lessee's offer will be referred to as a "Transferred Employee"); provided, that Lessee and its Affiliates will have no obligation to make any such offers. If made, such offer(s) will include for each Transferred Employee (i) benefits under Lessee's 401(k) Plan and benefit accruals for service after the Initial Closing under Lessee's Pension Plan which are the same benefits Lessee provides for its employees who work in Lessee's business, and (ii) welfare benefits under Lessee's welfare plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), which are the same to the maximum extent practicable as the welfare benefits Lessee provides for its similarly situated employees. (b) 401(k) Plans. (i) Contributors will make contributions on behalf of the Transferred Employees to the Contributors Benefit Plan which is the Contributors Retirement Savings Plan (the "Retirement Savings Plan") through the Initial Closing, but Contributors will take such action as necessary or appropriate to 53
assure that no Transferred Employee will be eligible to make or receive contributions under such plan for any period ending after the Initial Closing and that no Transferred Employee will be eligible to otherwise actively participate in such plan after the Initial Closing. Contributors will take whatever action is necessary or appropriate with respect to each Transferred Employee to provide the same opportunity to each applicable Transferred Employee to repay his or her loan or loans, if any, from the applicable plan as currently provided under the terms of the Retirement Savings Plan upon a termination of employment. (ii) The Transferred Employees will be eligible as of the Initial Closing to participate in a plan established, maintained or adopted by Lessee or the applicable Affiliate which is described in Section 401(k) of the Code (individually a "Lessee 401(k) Plan") and which will provide for elective deferrals (as the deferrals are described in Section 402(g)(3)(A) of the Code) by participants under Section 401(k) of the Code and for matching contributions (as described in Section 401(m)(4)(A)(ii) of the Code) by Lessee or such Affiliate with respect to the elective deferrals. The Lessee 401(k) Plan will provide that the Transferred Employees will have the right to make direct rollovers to the applicable plan of their vested accounts in the Retirement Savings Plan to the extent those rollovers constitute "eligible rollover distributions" within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code. The Transferred Employees will receive credit under the Lessee 401(k) Plan for all service with Contributors for purposes of satisfying any service requirement to participate in the applicable plan and any service requirement to earn a nonforfeitable benefit under the applicable plan. (c) Pension Plans. (i) Contributors will take such action as necessary or appropriate to assure that Transferred Employees will be eligible to accrue any benefits for service completed or compensation paid for periods before the Initial Closing under the Contributors Benefit Plan which is the Contributors Retirement Pension Plan (the "Retirement Pension Plan") and that no Transferred Employee will be eligible to otherwise actively participate in the applicable plan after the Initial Closing. (ii) If any employees of Lessee (as determined in accordance with the rules under Section 414(b) and Section 414(c) of the Code) participate in any defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) other than a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 414(f) of the Code) (individually a "Lessee Pension Plan"), the Transferred Employees will be eligible to participate in the applicable plan as of the Initial Closing. If there is more than one Lessee Pension Plan, the Transferred Employees will be eligible to participate in the Lessee Pension Plan which in Lessee's reasonable judgment provides benefits which in the aggregate are more like the benefits provided under the Retirement Pension Plan than the benefits provided under any other Lessee Pension Plan. The Transferred Employees will receive credit under the Lessee Pension Plan in which the Transferred Employees participate for all service with 54
Contributors for purposes of satisfying any service requirement to participate in the applicable plan and any service requirement to earn a nonforfeitable benefit under the applicable plan, but Lessee will have no obligation to provide the applicable service credit for purposes of computing any Transferred Employee's accrued benefit under the applicable plan. (d) Medical and Related Healthcare Benefits and Life Insurance. (i) Contributors will continue after the Initial Closing to make available to each Transferred Employee coverage under the Contributors Benefit Plans which are welfare plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), including post-retirement health and dental benefit coverage, to the same extent, and subject to the same terms and conditions, that the coverage would be continued under the terms of the applicable plans for any other former employee, and each applicable Transferred Employee who satisfies the age and service requirements for post-retirement health and dental benefit coverage immediately prior to the Initial Closing will have the same opportunity to receive coverage after the Initial Closing as if the applicable Transferred Employee had terminated employment immediately prior to the Initial Closing. (ii) Lessee on the Initial Closing will make available to the Transferred Employees Lessee's welfare plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) consistent with the requirements of Section 6.14(a)(ii), and each Transferred Employee will receive full credit under Lessee's welfare plans for all service completed with Contributors; provided, that Lessee will have no obligation to provide service credit for purposes of determining any applicable Transferred Employee's eligibility to receive post-retirement welfare benefits. SECTION 6.15 2004 Audited Financials; Unaudited Stub Period Financials. On or prior to March 31, 2005, regardless of whether the Initial Closing will have theretofore occurred, Contributors will deliver to Lessee true and correct copies of the audited consolidated statements of operations of the Sites for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, including the notes thereto, prepared in compliance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the SEC, as applicable to Lessee or its Affiliates. All of the foregoing financial statements are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "2004 Financial Statements." Except as disclosed in the 2004 Financial Statements, the 2004 Financial Statements will present fairly in all material respects the results of operations of the Sites on a consolidated basis for the applicable periods indicated, in each case in conformity with GAAP consistently applied except as noted in the 2004 Financial Statements. The 2004 Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) will be prepared from the books, accounts and financial records of Contributors. As soon as practicable upon request of Lessee (but in any event within forty (40) days after the end of each fiscal quarter), Contributors will deliver to Lessee unaudited consolidated statements of operations of the Sites for the prior stub period(s), provided, that Contributors will have no obligation to deliver any such stub period statements for periods beginning after the Initial Closing Date. 55
SECTION 6.16 Exclusivity; Return of Confidential Information. (a) Except with respect to the Excluded Assets, Strategic Sites or Excluded Sites, Contributors will not (and will not cause or permit any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, or agents to) (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the acquisition or lease of all or substantially all of the Sites (a "Competing Transaction"), including, without limitation, from any Person (other than Lessee or its Affiliates) that was at any time involved in the bidding and selection process for the sale or Lease of the Sites (the "Auction") in 2004 or 2005; or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Contributors will notify Lessee immediately if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry, or contact with respect to any Competing Transaction. (b) Sprint agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which Sprint or any of its Affiliates is a party with respect to the Auction, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Lessee. Sprint will promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with the Auction or its consideration of any other Competing Transaction to return all Confidential Information heretofore furnished to such Person by or behalf of Sprint or its Affiliates. SECTION 6.17 Notices of Certain Events. Contributors will promptly notify Lessee of: (a) any changes or events with respect to the Leased Property of a Site which, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Tower Liability; (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) (i) the damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the Leased Property of any Site or part thereof, (ii) in the event that the Leased Property of the Sites or part thereof becomes the subject of any proceeding or, to Contributors' knowledge, threatened proceeding, for the taking thereof or any part thereof or of any right relating thereto by condemnation, eminent domain or other similar governmental action, or (iii) any foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or similar proceeding with respect to any Lien against a Site, including any Ground Lessor Mortgage. SECTION 6.18 Sprint and its Affiliates' Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that, except with respect to the Sites (other than the Excluded Sites and Strategic Sites), nothing in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement is intended to create any prohibition or restriction on Sprint's 56
and/or its Affiliates (other than Lessor) ability to construct, lease or otherwise obtain the right to use (and lease tower space to third parties) wireless communications tower sites. ARTICLE 7 CONDITIONS TO LESSEE'S OBLIGATION TO CLOSE Lessee's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the applicable Closing Date (unless otherwise provided below) of each of the following conditions, any or all of which may be waived in whole or in part by Lessee: SECTION 7.1 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Contributors and Sprint. (a) The representations and warranties of Contributors and Sprint contained in Article 4 will be true and correct in all respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Initial Closing Date, except for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date or time other than the date of this Agreement and the Initial Closing Date (which need only be true and correct as of such specified date or time); provided, that the conditions precedent in this Section 7.1 will nevertheless be deemed satisfied unless the inaccuracy, falsity or incorrectness of such representations or warranties would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) The covenants and agreements of Contributors and Sprint to be performed on or before the Initial Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement will have been duly performed in all material respects. (c) Lessee will have received a certificate from (i) Contributors signed on behalf of each Contributor by an authorized officer of Contributors and (ii) an authorized officer of Sprint with respect to itself, in each case, to the effect set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) above dated the Initial Closing Date. SECTION 7.2 HSR Filings. At the Initial Closing Date, any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act will have expired or been terminated, or Contributors and Lessee will have mutually concluded that no filing under the HSR Act is required with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no action will have been instituted by the United States Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission challenging or seeking to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which action will not have been withdrawn or terminated. SECTION 7.3 No Injunction or Proceedings. At the Initial Closing Date, there will be no Order that is in effect that prohibits the Initial Closing and no legal proceedings will be pending involving any challenge to, or seeking material damages or other relief in connection with, any of the other 57
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements or that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise materially interfering with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements. SECTION 7.4 Collateral Agreements and Additional Closing Deliveries.

(d) The condition set forth in the Section 2.6(h) shall have been satisfied SECTION 7.5 Contributable Sites and Master Lease Sites. At the Initial Closing, as determined by Lessee in its reasonable discretion, (i) no less than sixty-five percent (65%) of the Sites will be Contributable Sites and (ii) no less than fifty percent (50%) of the Sites will be Master Lease Sites for which the Individual Site Closing Conditions have been satisfied or waived by Lessee (in Lessee's discretion), such percentages based on the ratio of the aggregate Rents and Pre-Lease Rents allocable to the Leased Property at such Contributable Sites and Master Lease Sites, as the case may be, divided by the aggregate Rents and Pre-Lease Rents payable with respect to all Sites, in each case as set forth on Exhibit H to the Lease Agreement (which will be agreed by the parties prior to the Initial Closing as set forth in Section 3.9). Any waiver of the foregoing conditions, in whole or part, will in no event effect whether (or not) a Site satisfies the conditions for a Financeable Site; however if Lessee elects to waive an Exception with respect to a Site for purposes of this Section 7.5 or Section 7.6 below and does not obtain the consent of the affected Contributor, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Contributors nor Lessor will be responsible for, and Lessee agrees to indemnify Contributors and Lessor from and against, any Liabilities resulting from or arising in connection with any such waived Exception. SECTION 7.6 Individual Site Closing Conditions. The Individual Site Closing Conditions with respect to any Master Lease Site which is to be Leased by Lessor to Lessee at such Closing will have been satisfied or waived by Lessee (however such waiver will in no event effect whether (or not) a Site satisfies the conditions for a Financeable Site).

(a) The representations and warranties of Lessee contained in Article 5 will be true and correct in all respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Initial Closing Date, except for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date or time other than the date of this Agreement or the Initial Closing Date (which need only be true and correct as of such specified date or time); provided, that the conditions precedent set forth in this Section 8.1(a) will be deemed satisfied unless the inaccuracy, falsity or incorrectness of such representations and warranties would reasonably be expected to have a Lessee Material Adverse Effect. (b) The covenants and agreements of Lessee to be performed on or before the Initial Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement will have been duly performed in all material respects.

(c) Neither Sprint nor Contributors will have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for Losses to the extent such Losses relate to the actions or obligations of Lessor under the Lease Agreement, such indemnities being only as and to the extent set forth in the Lease Agreement. (d) Lessee will take and will cause its Affiliates to take reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to or does give rise to any claim for Losses under this Article 9, but will not be required to incur costs to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Losses. (e) In the event of a Loss for which indemnification would be available to a Lessee Indemnified Party under Section 9.1(a)(vi), the damage for such Loss shall be measured by reference to the unamortized portion of the Rent or Pre-Lease Rent allocable to the lost Site as set forth on Exhibit H to the Lease Agreement. (f) The rights of the Lessee Indemnified Parties to indemnification under this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted or actual or constructive knowledge acquired at any time by a Lessee Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date hereof or any Closing Date; provided, however, that if Lessee is aware of any matter or condition that would permit Lessee not to close the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 7.1(a) and Lessee nonetheless proceeds to the Initial Closing, then the Lessee Indemnified Parties will have no right to seek indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i) with respect to Losses resulting or arising from such matter or condition. SECTION 9.2 Indemnification Obligations of Lessee. (a) Lessee will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Contributors Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any and all Losses arising out of or relating to: (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Lessee in Article 5 of this Agreement; or (ii) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Lessee in this Agreement. (b) Lessee will not have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any Losses to the extent that such Losses relate to the negligence, willful misconduct or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Contributors or Sprint contained in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement or by any other Person (other than Lessee or its Affiliates) or their respective officers, agents, employees, representatives, contractors, licensees, tenants or subtenants. (c) Contributors and Sprint will take and will cause their respective Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to or does give rise to any claim for Losses under this Article 9, but will not be required to incur costs to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Losses. 62
(d) The rights of the Contributors Indemnified Parties to indemnification under this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted or actual or constructive knowledge acquired at any time by a Contributors Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date hereof or any Closing Date; provided, however, that if Contributors is aware of any matter or condition that would permit Contributors not close the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 8.1(a) and Contributors nonetheless proceed to the Initial Closing, then the Contributor Indemnified Parties will have no right to seek indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to Losses resulting or arising from such matter or condition. (e) Indemnification of Contributors with respect to Lessee's failure to perform, discharge or satisfy any of the Assumed Liabilities will be limited as and to the extent provided in the Lease Agreement. (f) Lessee's payment and indemnification obligations with respect to Taxes will be governed solely under Section 16 and Section 39 of the Lease Agreement and not this Article 9. SECTION 9.3 Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims. (a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third party of a threatened or filed complaint or the threatened or actual commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other party for any Loss, such Indemnified Party will provide written notification to Lessee, Sprint or Contributors, whoever is the appropriate indemnifying party under this Agreement (the "Indemnifying Party"), within thirty (30) days of the Indemnified Party's becoming aware of the threatening or filing of such complaint or of the Indemnified Party's becoming aware of the threatened or actual commencement of such audit, investigation, action or proceeding; provided, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only to the extent that such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or (ii) prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to assume the defense of such complaint, audit, investigation, action or proceeding, including the employment of counsel and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the audit, investigation, action or proceeding on the terms provided above within such thirty (30) day period, then the Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such audit, investigation, action or proceeding and the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; provided, that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel (in addition to local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in any single audit, investigation, action or proceeding. In any audit, investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is being sought under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming 63
the defense of such action, will have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, will at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such matter. (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, other than with respect to Shared Ground Lease Payments the settlement and/or compromise of which will be governed by Section 3.4. (c) In the event an Indemnified Party will claim a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement not involving a third party claim covered by Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, such Indemnified Party will send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis for such claim. As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party will establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation or otherwise) and, within five (5) business days of the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party will pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined under this Agreement, if any. SECTION 9.4 Indemnity Period. The Indemnity Period under this Agreement will begin on the date of this Agreement and will terminate as follows: (a) the representations and warranties of the parties applicable to the Sites for which the Leased Property at such Sites is being Leased to Lessee at the Initial Closing or Conversion Closing, as the case may be, will survive for 180 days following the applicable Closing Date and all other representations and warranties of the parties will survive for ninety (90) days following the Final Closing Date; provided, that the following representations and warranties will survive indefinitely: Section 4.1 (Organization), Section 4.2 (Authority; No Conflicts), Section 4.8 (Brokers; Finders, etc.), Section 5.1 (Incorporation), Section 5.2 (Authority), Section 5.3 (No Conflicts) and Section 5.6 (Brokers, Finders, etc.); (b) the covenants and agreements of the parties contemplated to be satisfied prior to the Initial Closing will not survive the Initial Closing; (c) the covenants and agreements of the parties applicable to the Sites for which the Leased Property at such Sites is being Leased to Lessee at a Closing that are contemplated to be satisfied prior to such Closing will not survive such Closing; 64
(d) any covenants and agreements (including those set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.2) that expressly contemplate action to be taken after any such Closing will survive such Closing in accordance with their terms; (e) the provisions of Section 9.1(a)(iii) will survive until the date that is sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, including as it may be extended from time to time by either of the parties; and (f) the provisions of Section 9.1(a)(iv) and Section 9.1(a)(v) will survive indefinitely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last day of the applicable Indemnity Period, an Indemnifying Party has been properly notified of a claim for Losses under this Agreement and such claim has not been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim will continue to survive and will remain a basis for indemnity under this Agreement until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 9.5 Liability Limits. (a) The Lessee Indemnified Parties will not make a claim against Contributors or Sprint for indemnification under Section 9.1 for any single Loss less than $15,000 (each, a "De Minimis Claim"), unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses under Section 9.1, including for this purpose any De Minimis Claims, exceeds $10,000,000 (the "Lessee Deductible"); provided, that claims for indemnification (x) for breaches of the representations and warranties of Sprint or Contributors, as applicable, set forth in Section 4.1 (Organization), Section 4.2 (Authority; No Conflicts), and Section 4.8 (Brokers, Finders, etc.), (y) under Section 9.1(a)(ii), Section 9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv) and Section 9.1(a)(v), and (z) as set forth in Section 3.3(b)(ii)(4), will not be subject to the Lessee Deductible or the De Minimis Claim amount. (b) The Contributors Indemnified Parties will not make a claim against Lessee for indemnification under Section 9.2 for any De Minimis Claim, unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses under Section 9.2, including for this purpose any De Minimis Claims, exceeds $10,000,000 (the "Contributors Deductible"); provided, that claims for indemnification (x) for breaches of the representations and warranties of Lessee set forth in Section 5.1 (Incorporation), Section 5.2 (Authority), Section 5.6 (Brokers, Finders, etc.), and Section 5.10 (Financial Capability), and (y) under Section 9.2(a)(ii), and Section 9.2(a)(iii) will not be subject to the Contributors Deductible or the De Minimis Claim amount. SECTION 9.6 Exclusive Remedies. Except for fraud, willful and intentional misrepresentation, willful and intentional breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants, or any equitable remedy provided in Section 11.10, the provisions of this Article 9 set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of the Contributors Indemnified Parties and the Lessee Indemnified Parties to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any party with 65
respect to matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. SECTION 9.7 Netting of Losses. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article 9 will take into account (a) any amounts recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification agreement with, any third party, (b) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement collectable by the Indemnified Party in connection with any Losses and (c) any Tax consequences associated with such Losses and the recovery thereof. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 of this Agreement is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article 9, the Indemnified Party will repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article 9 had such determination been made at the time of such payment. ARTICLE 10 TERMINATION SECTION 10.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the Initial Closing Date: (a) by mutual written consent of Contributors and Lessee; (b) by either Contributors or Lessee, if the Initial Closing will not have occurred on or prior to the day that is 180 days after the date of this Agreement so long as the terminating party had not breached of any of its obligations under this Agreement in a manner that substantially delayed of the Initial Closing; provided, that neither party will have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (b) prior to the date that is 270 days after the date of this Agreement if the principal reason the Initial Closing has not occurred on or prior to the day that is 180 days after the date of this Agreement is the failure of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 8.2 to be satisfied. (c) by Contributors, provided that they are not then in breach of any of their obligations under this Agreement, if Lessee (i) fails in any material respect to perform any of its covenants in this Agreement when performance thereof is due, (ii) has breached in any material respect any of the representations or warranties contained in Article 5 of this Agreement and does not cure the failure or breach within forty-five (45) days after Contributors deliver written notice thereof, or (iii) prior to the date (the "First Milestone Date") that is 140 days after the date of this Agreement, has failed to obtain Ground Lessor Estoppels for at least 50% of the Sites (such percentage calculated as set forth in Section 7.5), unless a significant reason for such failure is the breach by Contributors or Sprint of their undertakings under Articles 2 or 3 with respect to the identification and 66
cure of Exceptions and/or related representations or warranties (it being understood that Lessee has agreed to the Milestones Dates in material reliance that Contributors and Sprint will provide the resources, materials and cooperation required to be provided by Contributors and Sprint pursuant to Article 2 and Article 3 in connection with identifying addressing and curing any exceptions in a timely manner), or a good faith dispute with Contributors over the existence or cure of an Exception that results in arbitration, but in any event provided that all other conditions to the Initial Closing will have been satisfied (or waived by the applicable party); provided, that (A) Lessee may elect to extend the First Milestone Date for an additional twenty-five (25) days (the "Second Milestone Date") by written notice to Contributors and delivery of an Additional Deposit to Escrow Agent on or before the First Milestone Date and (B) Lessee may elect to extend the Second Milestone Date until the date that is 180 days after the date of this Agreement (the "Last Milestone Date") by written notice to Contributors and delivery of an Additional Deposit to Escrow Agent on or before the Second Milestone Date; (d) by Lessee, provided that it is not then in breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, if Contributors (i) fail in any material respect to perform any of their covenants in this Agreement when performance thereof is due or (ii) have breached in any material respect any of the representations and warranties contained in Article 4 of this Agreement and do not cure the failure or breach within forty-five (45) days after Lessee delivers written notice thereof; or (e) by either Contributors or Lessee, if any permanent injunction, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority preventing consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements will have become final and nonappealable or any Law will make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements illegal or otherwise prohibited. SECTION 10.2 Effect of Termination.

Lessee agrees that it will promptly pay or cause to be paid the Ground Rent under each of the Ground Leases for the Leased Sites or Other Interest Sites, as applicable during the Term of this Agreement when such payments become due and payable and, if Lessee fails to pay Ground Rent under any Ground Lease on a timely basis, Lessee will be responsible for any applicable late charges, fees or interest payable to the Ground Lessor; provided, however, that should any Ground Lessor refuse the payment of Ground Rent for an applicable Site from any Person other than Lessor or its Affiliate, as applicable, then Lessor or its Affiliate, as applicable, after written notice from Lessee of the need for payment from such Person, will promptly pay such amount, and Lessee will reimburse Lessor therefor within five (5) days after the date of Lessor's payment. Except as provided in Section 4(c), Lessee will abide by, comply in all respects with, and fully and completely perform all terms, covenants, conditions, and provisions of each Ground Lease (including, without limitation, terms, covenants, conditions, and provisions relating to maintenance, insurance and alterations) as if Lessee were the "ground lessee" under the applicable Ground Lease and, to the extent evidence of such performance must be provided to the Ground Lessor of the applicable Ground Lease, Lessee will provide such evidence to Ground Lessor. Unless otherwise directed by Lessee or upon the suspension of the limited power of attorney granted to Lessee below, neither Lessor, Sprint, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall take any actions to interfere with Lessee acting as the "ground lessee" under any Ground Leases as long as Lessee is performing its obligations with respect to Ground Leases hereunder. To the extent that any Ground Lease imposes or requires the performance of the "ground lessee" thereunder of any duty or obligation that is more stringent than or in conflict with any term, covenant, condition, or provision of this Agreement, the applicable term, covenant, condition, or provision of the Ground Lease will control and will constitute the duties and obligations of Lessee under this Agreement as to the subject matter of such term, covenant, condition, or 19
provision. Lessee will not (and with respect to its activities on the Sprint Collocation Space, each Sprint Collocator will not) engage in or permit any conduct that would: (i) constitute a breach of or default under any Ground Lease; or (ii) result in the Ground Lessor being entitled to terminate the applicable Ground Lease or to terminate Lessor's right as ground lessee under such Ground Lease, or to exercise any other rights or remedies to which the Ground Lessor may be entitled for a default or breach under the applicable Ground Lease. In no event shall Lessee have any liability to any Sprint Group Member for any breach of a Ground Lease caused by an act or omission of Lessor or any Sprint Group Member, before, on, or after the Effective Date, and the Sprint Collocators hereby indemnify and hold the Lessee Indemnitees harmless from and against and in respect of any and all Claims (other than Claims, to the extent arising from actions taken by Lessee or its Affiliates) paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by any Lessee Indemnitee and in any manner arising out of, by reason of, or in connection therewith. During the Term as to any Leased Site or Other Interest Site, as applicable, and subject to Sections 4(c) and 4(f) below, Lessee agrees to exercise prior to the expiration of the applicable Ground Lease and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Ground Lease, any and all renewal options existing as of the Effective Date and any further renewal or extension options that may be granted by any Ground Lessor after the Effective Date for any such Leased Site or Other Interest Site, as applicable, under the Ground Leases of such Leased Sites or Other Interest Sites, as applicable; provided, however, that Lessee shall not be required to exercise any Ground Lease renewal option if the Sprint Collocator at the Site covered by such Ground Lease is in default of its obligations under this Agreement as to the Site beyond applicable notice and cure periods provided herein. (b) Lessee will not be entitled to act as agent for, or otherwise on behalf of, Lessor or its Affiliates or to bind Lessor or its Affiliates in any way whatsoever in connection with any Ground Lease or otherwise except as provided in this Section 4. Lessor hereby delegates to Lessee the sole and exclusive right to perform the obligations of and assert the rights of the "ground lessee" under all Ground Leases and of the Sprint Contributors under all Collocation Agreements with respect to Pre-Lease Sites, and to exercise all rights thereunder subject only to the other provisions of this Section 4. In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, Lessee will have the right to review, negotiate and execute on behalf of Lessor amendments and other documentation relating to Ground Leases and to otherwise act on behalf of Lessor in dealing with the Ground Lessors under the Ground Leases, and Lessor hereby grants to Lessee a limited power of attorney and, subject to any limitation on such appointment herein, appoints Lessee as its agent and attorney to review, negotiate and execute on behalf of Lessor amendments and other documentation relating to Ground Leases and to otherwise act on behalf of Lessor in dealing with the Ground Lessors under the Ground Leases. The foregoing power of attorney and appointment are subject to the following requirements and limitations: (i) all amendments and other documentation executed by Lessee, and actions taken by Lessee on behalf of Lessor must comply in all respects with the requirements and provisions of this Agreement, (ii) upon request by Lessor, Lessee will provide Lessor with such summaries, documentation and other information relating to Lessee's negotiations and other activities pertaining to the Ground Lease and the Ground Lessors as Lessor may reasonably request, and (iii) the foregoing power of attorney and appointment granted herein to Lessee may be suspended by written notice from Lessor to Lessee at any time upon the occurrence of an event of default by Lessee under this Agreement or if Lessee violates or fails to comply with the foregoing requirements and limitations and until such violation or failure is cured. Lessee may use such power of attorney to 20
(i) negotiate and execute any Ground Lease renewal that is for a term of not more than five (5) years, which may contain successive five (5) year renewal options and otherwise shall be on commercially reasonable terms, (ii) execute other modifications, waivers and amendments to Ground Leases that are reasonably required in the normal business and operations of the Sites or (iii) amend, modify, enforce or waive any terms of any Collocation Agreements applicable to Pre-Lease Sites.

Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no amendment, renewal, extension or other change to any Ground Lease desired by Lessee during the Term pursuant to this Section 4 will be effected without the prior consent of Lessor, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Lessor or the Sprint Contributors, as applicable, shall respond to any written request that they execute or consent to the execution of a Ground Lease amendment within ten (10) Business Days of written notice thereof, with a failure to respond being deemed a consent to the execution of such Ground Lease amendment by Lessee. (c) With respect to any negotiations with a Ground Lessor of the terms of a renewal or extension of a Ground Lease (other than a renewal or extension pursuant to an option contained in such Ground Lease which Lessor is obligated to exercise pursuant to Section 4(a)), Lessee will, at Lessee's sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and obtain an extension or renewal of all Ground Leases of the Leased Sites and Other Interest Sites on behalf of and for the benefit of Lessor, and Lessor, if requested by Lessee, will make commercially reasonable efforts to assist Lessee in obtaining such extension or renewal; provided, however, that such renewal or extension does not impose any liability or obligation on Lessor, any Sprint Collocator or any of their respective Affiliates during the Term as to the applicable Site for which Lessee is not responsible (or subsequently agrees to be responsible) under the terms of this Agreement. If, at the conclusion of any such negotiations by Lessee (a "Lessee Negotiated Renewal"), Lessee has obtained a proposal from the applicable Ground Lessor for the renewal or extension of such Ground Lease that provides for Renewal Ground Rent under such renewal or extension that does not exceed one hundred sixty percent (160%) of the Expiring Ground Rent, does not increase any revenue sharing thereunder and does not impose any other conditions or responsibilities on the Lessee thereunder materially more onerous than in such Ground Lease prior to the renewal thereof for such Site, Lessee agrees that Lessee will be required to accept such proposal and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such renewal or extension to be entered into (subject to the Sprint Collocator not being in default hereunder at such Site beyond applicable notice and cure periods provided herein); provided, however, that in such event the Sprint Collocation Charge payable by the Sprint Collocator under this Agreement for the Sprint Collocation Space at the Site that is subject to such renewal or extension will increase during the entire period of such renewal or extension (and any subsequent renewals or extensions thereof exercised prior to the applicable Withdrawal Date) by the amount 21
of the Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment. If the proposed Lessee Negotiated Renewal provides for Renewal Ground Rent that exceeds one hundred sixty percent (160%) of the Expiring Ground Rent or otherwise increases any revenue sharing thereunder or otherwise imposes any other conditions materially more onerous than those contained in such Ground Lease prior to the renewal thereof for such Site, and Lessee does not desire to accept Renewal Ground Rent, Lessee shall so notify Lessor in writing of the Renewal Ground Rent provided for in such Lessee Negotiated Renewal, and Lessor shall have right (exercisable by written notice from Lessor to Lessee within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice from Lessee to Lessor) to either (i) require Lessee to accept such proposal and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Lessee Negotiated Renewal to be entered into (but only at a Renewal Ground Rent not exceeding the amount of the Renewal Ground Rent contained in the proposed Lessee Negotiated Renewal of which Lessor was so notified) or (ii) attempt to negotiate the Renewal Ground Rent for the period of such renewal or extension directly with the applicable Ground Lessor; provided, however, that in either of such events, if any renewal or extension is thereafter entered into, the Sprint Collocation Charge payable by the Sprint Collocator under this Agreement for the Sprint Collocation Space at the Site that is subject to such renewal or extension will increase during the entire period of such renewal or extension (and any subsequent renewals or extensions thereof exercised prior to the applicable Withdrawal Date) by the amount of the Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment. Lessee at any time may enter into any renewal or extension of a Ground Lease on any commercially reasonable terms as it may elect. To the extent that Lessee or any Affiliate of Lessee succeeds to the interest of any Ground Lessor in and to the Ground Lease located at any Site, upon the expiration of the term of such Ground Lease (and any renewal options contained therein), the term of such Ground Lease shall thereafter be automatically renewed for additional five (5) year terms on the same terms and conditions as the immediately preceding renewal or extension term of the Ground Lease, provided, however, that the Ground Rent thereunder shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of (x) the Ground Rent in the term then expiring and (y) a fraction (but not less than one), the numerator of which is the aggregate base Ground Rent payable during the final term of said Ground Lease (prior to renewal in accordance with this sentence) and the denominator of which is the aggregate base Ground Rent payable during the term immediately preceding the final term of said Ground Lease (prior to renewal in accordance with this sentence), assuming such terms are of equivalent length (or, if not of equivalent length, then the period over which the base Ground Rent for the expiring Ground Lease shall be calculated shall match the length of the renewal or extension, as applicable), or if such Ground Lease had only one term thereto, then the base Ground Rent shall increase during each year of the renewal or extension at the periodic escalations, if any, provided for in the immediately previous five (5) years of the term of such Ground Lease. (d) Commencing from and after January 1, 2007, if on the date that is six (6) months prior to the expiration of any Ground Lease, such Ground Lease has not been renewed or extended, Lessee will so notify Lessor in writing, and Lessor, at its option, may attempt to negotiate such renewal or extension and if Lessee has not previously used commercially reasonable efforts pursuant to Section 4(c) to obtain such renewal or extension, Lessee will reimburse Lessor for its reasonable out of pocket expenses relating to such negotiation; provided, however, that Lessor will not in connection with such renewal or extension, without the approval of Lessee, agree to any revenue sharing in excess of existing revenue sharing arrangements. If Lessor completes the foregoing negotiations for, and executes and delivers, such renewal or 22
extension (a "Lessor Negotiated Renewal"), the Term as to such Site shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that the Sprint Collocation Charge payable by the Sprint Collocator under this Agreement for the Sprint Collocation Space at the Site that is subject to the Lessor Negotiated Renewal will increase during the entire period of such Lessor Negotiated Renewal (and any subsequent renewals or extensions thereof) by the amount of the Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, however, in the event of an increase in the Sprint Collocation Charge as a result of the payment by the Sprint Collocator of any Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment under this Agreement, no portion of the Sprint Collocation Charge attributable to any Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment shall be subject to the annual increase in the Sprint Collocation Charge provided for in Section 11(b) (except that the Sprint Collocator will be obligated to pay as a part of the Sprint Collocation Charge any periodic increases in the Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment based on increased rent, fees and other charges provided for in the applicable Ground Lease during the period of the applicable renewal or extension). The foregoing sentence shall not limit the annual increase in the portions of the Sprint Collocation Charge other than the Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment as provided in Section 11(b). If Lessor or Lessee is not able to renew or extend any Ground Lease in accordance with Section 4(c) and this Section 4(d), then the Parties will permit such Ground Lease to expire on the applicable expiration date, in which event this Agreement will have no further force and effect as to the Leased Site or Other Interest Site, as applicable, to which such Ground Lease applies except for such obligations accruing prior to or as of such expiration date that are then unperformed. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal with respect to a Site pursuant to which the Sprint Collocator is obligated to pay any Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(c) or 4(d), such Sprint Collocator agrees that (i) if such Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal provides for Renewal Ground Rent that exceeds one hundred sixty percent (160%) of the Expiring Ground Rent and the Sprint Collocator exercises its Withdrawal Right with respect to such Site so that the Withdrawal Date for such Site would occur during the term of such Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal, the Withdrawal Date for such Site shall be automatically extended to, and shall be, the expiration date of the then current term of such Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal, (or if such Ground Lease has been extended prior to such exercise of the Withdrawal Right, the Withdrawal Date shall be automatically extended until the expiration of the next applicable Ground Lease term) and (ii) if such Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal provides for Renewal Ground Rent exceeding one hundred thirty percent (130%), but equal to or less than one hundred sixty percent (160%), of the Expiring Ground Rent for such Site, and the Sprint Collocator exercises its Withdrawal Right with respect to such Site so that the Withdrawal Date for such Site would occur during the term of such Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal the Sprint Collocator shall continue to pay to Lessee the portion of the Sprint Collocation Charge attributable to the Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment for such Site (but no other portion of the Sprint Collocation Charge) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement until the earlier of (y) the expiration of the then current term of such Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal (or if such Ground Lease has been extended prior to such exercise of the Withdrawal Right, the Withdrawal Date shall be automatically extended until the expiration of the next applicable Ground Lease term) or (z) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the commencement of the then current term of such 23
Lessee Negotiated Renewal or Lessor Negotiated Renewal (or if such Ground Lease has been extended prior to such exercise of the Withdrawal Right, the Withdrawal Date shall be automatically extended until the expiration of the next applicable Ground Lease term). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(e), the obligations of the applicable Sprint Collocator in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 4(e) shall not apply with respect to any Lessor Negotiated Renewal (without in any manner otherwise affecting the obligations of the applicable Sprint Collocator under clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence) if Lessee did not use commercially reasonable efforts pursuant to Section 4(c) to obtain a renewal or extension of the Ground Lease that was renewed or extended pursuant to such Lessor Negotiated Renewal. Lessee's commercially reasonable efforts shall mean providing the Sprint Collocators evidence, which may be a certification as to item (x), that it either (x) engaged in active negotiations with the applicable Ground Lessor or (y) sent regular correspondence to the applicable Ground Lessor with respect to renewing such Ground Lease, in either case, at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of such Ground Lease. Any dispute under this Section 4 shall be subject to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 31(h). If a Withdrawal Right is exercised with respect to a Site that is the subject of Lessor Negotiated Renewal or a Lessee Negotiated Renewal, Lessee shall have no obligation to exercise any further extension options under the Ground Lease applicable to such Site. (f) Upon receipt by Lessor or any other Sprint Group Member of any notice of default or notice of an act or omission which could with the passing of time and/or the giving of notice constitute an event of default under a Ground Lease or non-compliance with a term of a Ground Lease (the "Default Notice"), Lessor will, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Default Notice or such shorter time as is reasonably necessary to avoid a termination of such Ground Lease, provide Lessee with a copy of the Default Notice. If such default or non-compliance with a term of a Ground Lease is caused by Lessee or any Tower Subtenant, Lessee will, and will cause the applicable Tower Subtenant to, cure or otherwise remedy such default or noncompliance. If such default or non-compliance is caused by any Sprint Collocator, or any other Sprint Group Member, Lessor or the applicable Sprint Collocator will cause such default or non-compliance to be cured or otherwise remedied at its sole cost and expense. Lessor and each Sprint Contributor hereby agree that if because of the failure of Lessor or any Sprint Contributor to perform of any of its duties, obligations, liabilities or responsibilities under any Ground Lease that results in a default under and termination of a Ground Lease (unless such duty, obligation, liability or responsibility is assumed by Lessee hereunder), the applicable Sprint Collocators shall pay to Lessee an amount equal to the Unamortized Rent as of the date of termination of the Ground Lease for the affected Site; provided, however, that such payment shall be and constitute liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) to Lessee hereunder on account of such failure, it being agreed between the Parties that the actual damages to Lessee in such event are impractical to ascertain and the amount of the Unamortized Rent is a reasonable estimate thereof, and Lessee hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any and all other remedies at law or in equity. SECTION 5. Collocation Agreements. (a) Without limiting the generality of Section 4, Lessee expressly acknowledges that, as to each Site, this Agreement is subject to all Collocation Agreements currently in effect with respect to such Site as are set forth in the Agreement to Lease and Sublease. In respect of each Master Lease Site, by execution of this Agreement as to the Initial Master Lease Sites and 24
thereafter as of the Conversion Closing Date for each additional Master Lease Site, Lessor does transfer, assign and convey over unto Lessee, for the Term as to such Master Lease Site, all of its rights, title and interest in, to or under any Collocation Agreements affecting such Master Lease Site. In respect of each Pre-Lease Site, Lessor and each Sprint Contributor does hereby delegate all of its respective rights, duties, obligations and responsibilities under the Collocation Agreements to Lessee for the Term as to such Site for periods occurring from and after the Effective Date. Lessee does hereby assume and agree to pay and perform all of the duties, obligations, liabilities and responsibilities of Lessor and all Sprint Contributors under the Collocation Agreements affecting each Site arising from and after the Effective Date, and Lessee will receive all rents payable under such Collocation Agreement for periods occurring from and after the Effective Date. Lessor, each Sprint Contributor and Lessee acknowledge and agree that in connection with the transactions described in this Section 5(a), certain of the Collocation Agreements may be required to be bifurcated as provided in Section 6.11 of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease and shall be subject to further bifurcation as provided in Section 41(f). (b) Lessee will, and does hereby agree to, indemnify, defend and hold the Sprint Indemnitees harmless from, against and in respect of any and all Claims, paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by any Sprint Indemnitee and in any manner arising out of, by reason of, or in connection with any failure of the duties, obligations, liabilities and responsibilities of Lessor or the Sprint Contributors under any of the Collocation Agreements (solely in their role as "landlord" thereunder and not with respect to the use and operation of the Sprint Collocation Space or otherwise as the subtenant of a Site) affecting each Site and arising from and after the Effective Date, to be fully and completely performed pursuant to the Collocation Agreements; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnification shall not be deemed to abrogate or impair the operation or effect of any representations or warranties of the Sprint Contributor made with respect to the Collocation Agreements in the Agreement to Lease and Sublease or be applicable to a matter that constitutes an Excluded Liability under, and as defined in, the Agreement to Lease and Sublease. (c) The Sprint Collocators hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Lessee Indemnitees harmless from, against and in respect of any and all Claims, paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by any Lessee Indemnitee and in any manner arising out of, by reason of, or in connection with any failure of the duties, obligations, liabilities and responsibilities of Lessor or any Sprint Contributor under any of the Collocation Agreements affecting each Site and arising (i) prior to the date hereof, to be fully and completely performed pursuant to the Collocation Agreements, (ii) during the Term of this Agreement and is related to an action or failure to act by the Sprint Contributors or any of their respective Affiliates required under this Agreement, or (iii) following the expiration of the Term as to any Site to which any such Collocation Agreement applies from and after the date that any such Collocation Agreement is reassigned or deemed reassigned to Lessor or its designee as provided in Section 5(d). (d) Unless Lessee exercises the purchase option with respect to a Site under Section 36 of this Agreement, the assignment by Lessor to Lessee of the Collocation Agreements in respect of each Site will automatically terminate and expire and such Collocation Agreements will automatically be (or be deemed) reassigned or assigned, as the case may be, to Lessor or its designee, and Lessor or its designee will accept such reassignment or assignment, as the case 25
may be, upon the expiration of the Term of, or earlier termination of, this Agreement in respect of such Site. SECTION 6. Sprint Collocation Space. (a) Lessor, each Sprint Collocator and Lessee expressly acknowledge that, at all times during the Term as to each Master Lease Site, the Sprint Collocation Space of each Master Lease Site will be deemed to be leased, subleased or otherwise made available by Lessor to Lessee, and subleased back or otherwise made available to the applicable Sprint Collocator, pursuant to this Agreement, and the Sprint Collocation Space at each Pre-Lease Site will be deemed reserved for or otherwise be made available to the applicable Sprint Collocator pursuant to this Agreement, in each case for the exclusive possession and use by such Sprint Collocator and its Affiliates and permitted transferees, whether or not such Sprint Collocation Space is now or hereafter occupied. As a part of the Sprint Collocation Space of each Site, Lessee also grants to the Sprint Collocator as to each Master Lease Site, and the Sprint Collocator reserves and shall at times retain (for the benefit of the Sprint Collocator or any of its Affiliates and except to the extent limited by any restrictions contained in any applicable Ground Lease, the Permitted Encumbrances or by Law): (i) a non-exclusive right and easement (over the surface of the Site), but subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Ground Leases, the rights of Tower Subtenants, any other agreements affecting the Site existing prior to the Effective Date (not entered into by Lessee or its Affiliates) and such commercially reasonable rules and regulations as Lessee may from time to time propagate (such rules and regulations to be applied uniformly by Lessee between the Sprint Collocators and Tower Subtenants) and applicable Laws, for ingress to and egress from the entire Site, and access to the entire Tower and all Improvements to such Site and Tower, at such times (on a 24-hour, seven (7) day per week basis unless otherwise limited by the Ground Lease), to such extent, and in such means and manners (on foot or by motor vehicle, including trucks and other heavy equipment), as the Sprint Collocator deems reasonably necessary in connection with its full use and enjoyment of the Sprint Collocation Space, including, without limitation, a right to construct, install, use, operate, maintain, repair and replace its Communications Equipment on the applicable Sprint Collocation Space; and (ii) the right, exercisable only during periods during which the applicable Sprint Collocator is actively performing work at a Site (and subject to the terms of the applicable Ground Lease and applicable Laws), to use any unoccupied portion of the ground space at the applicable Site for purposes of temporary location and storage (but only during the period of the performance of such work at such Site) of any of its Communications Equipment and for performing any repairs or replacements (provided that such use and occupancy of any unoccupied portion of a Site will not materially adversely affect the use and occupancy by, or interfere with the operations of, a Tower Subtenant or Lessee of the Site, and, provided further that the Sprint Collocator will be required to remove any of its stored Communications Equipment on any unoccupied portion of the Site upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice from Lessee if such unoccupied portion of the Site is under sublease or other occupancy arrangement with a Tower Subtenant that is prepared to take occupancy of such portion of the Site or is otherwise required for use by Lessee for work or storage at such Site); and (iii) a non-exclusive right and easement for the use, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of all utility lines, Equipment and appurtenances now existing and located on the Site and providing electrical and any other utility service to Sprint's Communications Facility on the Site, which right and easement includes the right of the Sprint 26
Collocator and its agents, employees and contractors to enter upon the Site to repair, maintain and replace such utility facilities. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, except in the event of an Emergency, a Sprint Collocator shall give Lessee at least ten (10) days prior written notice of its intention to undertake any activity that involves having any Sprint Collocator or its contractors, subcontractors, engineers, agents, advisors, consultants, representatives, or other Persons authorized by such Sprint Collocator to (i) climb the Tower at any Site (and in the event of an Emergency the Sprint Collocator will provide such notice of having climbed the Tower promptly after performed such act), (ii) perform construction or maintenance activities that might reasonably be expected to temporarily or permanently affect access or use of a Site or (iii) involves the use of heavy equipment. No representation is made by Lessee with respect to whether any Sites are accessible by trucks or other heavy equipment or are currently capable of being utilized by same, and Lessee shall have no obligation to any Sprint Collocator to build access roads that are accessible by trucks or other heavy equipment or to prepare the Site to be utilized by same; provided, however, that Lessor will be required to maintain in such order and repair as would be required under industry standards such access roads existing as of the Effective Date and agrees not to take any action (except as required by Law, a Governmental Authority, the applicable Ground Lease existing prior to the Effective Date, any Collocation Agreement existing prior to the Effective Date or other agreement affecting the Site existing prior to the Effective Date (and not entered into by Lessee or its Affiliates)) that would materially diminish or impair any means of access to any Site existing as of the Effective Date. The Sprint Collocation Space at each Site, on the Land constituting a portion of such Site, shall include an additional unobstructed buffer area three (3) feet in width along and around the perimeter of all portions of Sprint's Improvements located on such Land (collectively, the "Sprint Buffer Zone"); provided, however, that the Sprint Collocators acknowledge and agree that (i) with respect Sprint's Improvements located on the Land at any Site on the Effective Date, the Sprint Buffer Zone is hereby established only to the extent it exists on any Site as of the Effective Date, (ii) with respect to the portions of Sprint's Improvements consisting of cable runs, the Sprint Buffer Zone need not necessarily include an area three (3) feet in width around the perimeter thereof so long as the applicable Sprint Collocator has reasonable access to such portions of Sprint's Improvements for the purposes of maintenance, repair and replacement thereof. If the Sprint Buffer Zone (coupled with applicable zoning, setback or other Laws or terms in the applicable Ground Lease or agreements with other Tower Subtenants) effectively limits Lessee's ability to lease, license or otherwise allow space at a Site to be used by a prospective Tower Subtenant in a commercially reasonable manner, then the Lessee may, by written notice to the applicable Sprint Collocator, request such Sprint Collocator to reduce the size of the Sprint Buffer Zone to accommodate the reasonable requirements of such prospective Tower Subtenant. Each such request shall be accompanied by reasonable information that will enable the Sprint Collocator to determine the nature and location of the requested reduction and the extent of the proposed encroachment into the Sprint Buffer Zone, and each Sprint Collocator agrees to not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to any such request. If any Sprint Collocator consents to such a reduction in the Sprint Buffer Zone, then such reduction shall be effective only during the period during which the permitted encroachment into the Sprint Buffer Zone exists, and at such time as the Improvements or Equipment at the applicable Site that encroach upon the Sprint Buffer Zone and are the subject of the permitted reduction are permanently removed, the Sprint Buffer Zone shall be reinstated to the extent it existed prior to 27
the time of the permitted reduction. In addition, if at any time the applicable Sprint Collocator has ceased use of any portion of the Sprint Collocation Space on the Tower that contained Communications Equipment located outside the Sprint Tower Envelope on the Effective Date, then Lessee may, by written notice to the applicable Sprint Collocator, request such Sprint Collocator to permit Lessee to use such unused portion of the Sprint Collocation Space to accommodate the reasonable requirements of such prospective Tower Subtenant, and each Sprint Collocator agrees to not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to any such request. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Lessor, Lessee and Sprint acknowledge and agree that certain Sites identified on Exhibit A, are either being leased, subleased or otherwise made available by Lessor to Lessee or being operated by Lessee pursuant to this Agreement but are not subject to the sublease to or reservation by any Sprint Collocator of any Sprint Collocation Space (such Sites, along with any Site where the applicable Sprint Collocator exercises its Withdrawal Rights from and after the Withdrawal Date for such Site, the "Non-Collocation Sites"), and the duties and obligations of any Sprint Collocator in this Agreement regarding Sprint Collocation Space shall not be applicable to the Non-Collocation Sites and (ii) Lessee shall have no duties to Lessor or Sprint with respect to such Non-Collocation Sites pursuant to Sections 6 and 25. On the Effective Date, the number of Sites either subleased back or otherwise made available to the applicable Sprint Collocator shall not be less than the number of Sites determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 2.6(h) of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease. (d) Each Sprint Collocator will, at all times during the Term as to any Site, at such Sprint Collocator's sole cost and expense, keep and maintain Sprint's Communications Equipment and Sprint's Improvements in a structurally safe and sound condition and in working order. (e) Without limiting any of Lessee's rights or obligations under this Agreement, Lessee acknowledges and agrees that Lessee will not engage, nor will it permit any Tower Subtenant to engage, in any conduct or activity that might reasonably be expected to interfere (excluding electrical interference which will be governed by Section 15) with the Sprint Collocator's peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the Sprint Collocation Space or the use and operation of the Sprint Collocator of Sprint's Communications Equipment at such Site. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Lessee be required to enforce any rights against or resolve any disputes with a Tower Subtenant who at the time of such enforcement action or dispute is an Affiliate of Sprint. (f) Without limiting the rights or obligations of any Sprint Collocator under this Agreement, each Sprint Collocator acknowledges and agrees that it will not engage, nor permit its Affiliates to engage, in any conduct or activity that might reasonably be expected to interfere (excluding electrical interference which will be governed by Section 15) with Lessee's or any Tower Subtenant's peaceful and quiet enjoyment of its space on any Tower or the use and operation of Communications Equipment by any Tower Subtenant. (g) Each Sprint Collocator agrees to indemnify and hold the Lessee Indemnitees harmless from and against and in respect of any and all Claims, paid, suffered, incurred or 28
sustained by any Lessee Indemnitee and in any manner arising out of, by reason of, or in connection with the activities of such Sprint Collocator or any of its Affiliates in connection with any work at any applicable Site performed at by or at the direction of such Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates (but not including any work at any Site that Lessee is required to perform pursuant to this Agreement). The applicable Sprint Collocator shall restore any property damage to any Site or appurtenant property or any access roads thereto in connection with any such work caused by motor vehicles, trucks or heavy equipment of such Sprint Collocator, any of its employees, agents, contractors or designees. If such restoration work is not performed by such Sprint Collocator within fifteen (15) days after written notice from Lessee (or if not capable of being performed within such fifteen (15) day period, then within a reasonable period of time provided that the Sprint Collocator is actively and diligently pursuing completion of such restoration work), Lessee may, but shall not be obligated to perform such work on behalf of an for the account of such Sprint Collocator, and such Sprint Collocator shall reimburse Lessee for the costs of such restoration work within fifteen (15) days after demand thereof, together with reasonable evidence of the incurrence of such costs. (h) Lessee agrees to and does hereby waive and relinquish any lien of any kind and any and all rights, including levy, execution and sale for unpaid rents, that Lessee may have or obtain on or with respect to any of Sprint's Communications Equipment. SECTION 7. Permitted Use. (a) Lessee will use, and will permit the use of, the Leased Property at each Site only for the Permitted Use. (b) Lessee will not use, or permit to be used, any Site, or any portion of such Site, by Lessee, any Person (other than the applicable Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates) or the public in such manner as might reasonably be expected to impair Lessor's title to, or interest or rights in, such Site, or any portion of such Site, or in such manner as might reasonably make possible a Claim or Claims of adverse usage or adverse possession by the public, as such, or any Person (other than the applicable Sprint Collocator or any of its Affiliates), or of implied dedication of any of the Leased Property of such Site. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action or inaction by Lessor, any Sprint Collocator or any of their respective Affiliates will be deemed or construed to mean that Lessor or any Sprint Collocator has granted to Lessee any right, power or permission to do any act or make any agreement that may create, or give rise to or be the foundation for any such right, title, interest, lien, charge or other encumbrance upon the estate of Lessor in any Site. (c) Each Sprint Collocator will use the Sprint Collocation Space at each Site only for installation, use, operation, repair and replacement of Sprint's Communications Facility. No Sprint Collocator will use the Sprint Collocation Space at any Site in such manner as might reasonably be expected to impair Lessee's rights or interest in such Site or in such manner as might reasonably make possible a Claim or Claims of adverse usage or adverse possession by the public, as such, or any other Person (other than the Sprint Collocator or any of its Affiliates), or of implied dedication of such Sprint Collocation Space. Except as specifically permitted hereunder, Sprint shall have no right to use or occupy any space at any Site other than the Sprint 29
Collocation Space that it occupies from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 8. Access. Except to the extent limited by any restrictions contained in any applicable Ground Lease, the Permitted Encumbrances, this Agreement or by Law, the interest or rights of Lessee in or to each Site under this Agreement includes, as an appurtenance thereto, a non-exclusive right for access to the Leased Property of each Site on a 24-hour, seven (7) day per week basis, on foot or motor vehicle, including trucks and other heavy equipment, for the installation and maintenance of the Tower and Improvements of such Site and the Communications Facilities of Tower Subtenants. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the right to access to any portion of the Leased Property of each Site granted pursuant to this Section 8 will be granted to Lessee and its authorized contractors, subcontractors, engineers, agents, advisors, consultants, representatives, or other persons authorized by Lessee and, under Lessee's direct supervision, and to Tower Subtenants, subject to any restrictions contained in the applicable Ground Lease, the Permitted Encumbrances, this Agreement or by Law. SECTION 9. Term. (a) The term of this Agreement, as to each Master Lease Site, will commence on the Effective Date with respect to the Initial Master Lease Sites and Conversion Closing Date (as acknowledged and confirmed in the applicable Site Designation Supplement) with respect to all other Master Lease Sites and will expire on the Site Expiration Date for such Site. The term of this Agreement, as to each Pre-Lease Site, will commence on the Effective Date and will expire on the Site Expiration Date for such Site; provided; however, that the term of this Agreement as to any Pre-Lease Site shall automatically expire as a result of a Conversion Closing under the provisions of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease, in which event the Pre-Lease Site will automatically be converted to and become a Master Lease Site hereunder as of the Conversion Closing Date for such Site, and no further instrument will be required to evidence such conversion; provided, however, that upon the request of any Party, the Parties will promptly execute such instruments as may be reasonably required to further evidence such conversion. This Agreement will remain in full force and effect until the expiration or earlier termination of the term of this Agreement as to all Sites. (b) No surrender by Lessee to Lessor of the Leased Property of any Master Lease Site or any portion of such Site, prior to the expiration of the Term as to such Master Lease Site will be valid or effective unless agreed to and accepted in writing by Lessor, and no act by Lessor, other than such a written acceptance, will constitute an acceptance of any such surrender. (c) Upon expiration or earlier termination of the Term as to any Master Lease Site or as to any Pre-Lease Site prior to any Conversion Closing for such Pre-Lease Site, Lessee, if requested by Lessor, will, at its cost and expense and in accordance with instructions of Lessor, within a reasonable period of time, but in no event less than thirty (30) days or such shorter period of time as may be required under any applicable Ground Lease, (i) cause the Tower Subtenants on such Site to stop and cease the operation of their respective Communications Facilities on such Site (but only to the extent that any such Tower Subtenant, in Lessee's 30
reasonable judgment, does not occupy such Site pursuant to a commercially reasonable Collocation Agreement) and (ii) to the extent permitted by the applicable Ground Lease, remove all of Lessee's Severable Alterations from such Site and restore each Site substantially to the condition it was in on the Effective Date, subject to the addition of any permitted Non-Severable Alterations; provided, however, that upon expiration or earlier termination of the Term as to any Site upon the expiration or termination of any Ground Lease, if required by the applicable Ground Lease, Lessee will remove the Tower and any Improvements (whether or not constituting Severable Alterations) from such Site and otherwise restore such Site to the condition required under the applicable Ground Lease. The Tower and any Improvements so removed (to the extent not constituting Severable Alterations of Lessee) will either be (i) delivered by Lessee to any Person designated by Lessor for disposition by Lessor or its designee, who shall pay to Lessee its cost of removal thereof, up to the net sales proceeds such Person receives from the dispositions thereof, or (ii) sold or otherwise disposed of by Lessee for not less than their salvage value, and the net proceeds of such sale or other disposition after deducting Lessee's cost of removal thereof will be paid to Lessor when and as received by Lessee. Any Severable Alterations not removed by Lessee within such 30-day period will, at Lessor's option, be deemed abandoned by Lessee and title to such Severable Alterations will automatically, without further action, vest in Lessor. Except as set forth in Section 41, in the event of the expiration of the Term as to any Site prior to the Site Expiration Outside Date, and without limiting any of Lessee's other rights or remedies hereunder, Lessee will have no right or claim to any refund or credit of any portion of the prepaid Rent for such Site. Each Site shall be delivered by Lessee to Lessor at the end of the Term as to such Site in the condition required by this Agreement and shall otherwise be delivered to Lessor in good condition, repair and order, reasonable wear and tear and casualty and condemnation which Lessee is not required to repair excepted, but without any implied warranties. (d) Upon expiration or earlier termination of the Term as to any Master Lease Site or any Pre-Lease Site (other than as a result of the conversion of such Pre-Lease Site to a Master Lease Site hereunder), Lessee, if requested by Lessor, will deliver or cause to be delivered to Lessor (i) copies of all written (and effective) Ground Leases, Collocation Agreements and material Governmental Approvals solely related to such Site or, to the extent not solely related, appropriate extracts thereof, and (ii) copies of, or extracts from, all current files and records of Lessee solely related to the ownership, occupancy or leasing of such Site or, to the extent not so solely related, appropriate extracts thereof; provided, that Lessee will not be required to deliver to Lessor any privileged document and Lessee, in its sole discretion, may deliver such documents in electronic form. (e) Unless and until Lessee has exercised its purchase option under Section 36, Lessor will maintain or replace all Tower Removal Bonds as are in existence as of the Effective Date with respect to the Sites (and provide Lessee copies of same), unless any such Tower Removal Bond is no longer required with respect to a Site. Lessee will, and does hereby agree to, indemnify, defend and hold the Sprint Indemnitees harmless from, against and in respect of any and all Claims paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by any Sprint Indemnitee and in any manner arising out of, by reason of or in connection with the failure of Lessee to comply with the conditions of the Tower Removal Bonds or any claim made by an obligee on, or any payment made to, such obligee under any Tower Bond. 31
SECTION 10. Withdrawal. (a) The Sprint Collocator at each Site will have Withdrawal Rights, which will be exercisable in respect of any Site only if the applicable Withdrawal Date is (i) on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Ten Year Withdrawal Date"), (ii) on the last day of each successive five (5) year period thereafter or (iii) at any time after the Ten Year Withdrawal Date if there is an occurrence of a Withdrawal Cause. To exercise any such Withdrawal Rights with respect to any Site, the applicable Sprint Collocator will give Lessee written notice of such exercise (the "Withdrawal Notice"), as applicable (A) not less than one (1) year prior to the Ten Year Withdrawal Date, (B) one hundred eighty (180) days prior to any applicable Withdrawal Date pertaining to any five (5) year period following the Ten Year Withdrawal Date, and (C) ninety (90) days prior to any Withdrawal Date occurring as a result of the occurrence of Withdrawal Cause. If a Sprint Collocator exercises the Withdrawal Rights as to any Site, the Sprint Collocator will not be required to pay the Sprint Collocation Charge with respect to such Site for the period occurring after the Withdrawal Date specified in the applicable Withdrawal Notice. Not later than the Withdrawal Date of any Site, the Sprint Collocator will vacate the Sprint Collocation Space of such Site and remove, at such Sprint Collocator's cost and expense, all of Sprint's Communications Equipment at such Site (and otherwise leave the vacant Sprint Collocation Space in good condition, repair and order (reasonable wear and tear and loss by casualty and condemnation excepted) and shall remove all of Sprint's Communications Equipment therefrom and restore any damage thereto caused by, through or under any Sprint Group Member), if such Sprint Collocation Space is occupied, whereupon the Sprint Collocator's right to occupy and use the Sprint Collocation Space of such Site pursuant to this Agreement will be terminated. At the request of either the applicable Sprint Collocator or Lessee, the appropriate Parties will enter into documentation, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Parties, evidencing any withdrawal effected pursuant to this Agreement. (b) In addition to, and not in limitation of any right of any Sprint Collocator under Section 10(a), and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without limiting or diminishing Sprint's payment obligations hereunder in any manner, including its obligation to pay Sprint Collocation Charge, no Sprint Collocator will have any obligation to occupy, or to operate a Communications Facility on, the Sprint Collocation Space of any Site, and each Sprint Collocator will have the right, exercisable at any time during the Term as to any Site, to cease occupying or operating Sprint's Communications Facility on the Sprint Collocation Space of such Site, and retain its right to such Sprint Collocation Space and may permit any of its Affiliates to occupy such Sprint Collocation Space, so long as the Sprint Collocator remains the primary obligor for the Sprint Collocation Charge in respect of such Site and such Affiliates' use of the Sprint Collocation Space is in accordance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In no event shall such use and occupancy by an Affiliate of Sprint diminish the applicable Sprint Collocator's rights and obligations hereunder. SECTION 11. Rent and Pre-Lease Rent; Sprint Collocation Charge. (a) Lessee will prepay Rent in respect of the Leased Property of each of the Initial Master Lease Sites for the entire Term as to such Master Lease Site on the Effective Date. Lessee will prepay the Pre-Lease Rent in respect of the Leased Property of each Pre-Lease Site for the entire Term as to such Pre-Lease Site on the Effective Date for each Pre-Lease Site. Such 32
Rent and Pre-Lease Rent will be specifically allocated to the periods as set forth in Exhibit H ("Allocated Rent"); provided, however, that if any Pre-Lease Site becomes a Master Lease Site as a result of a Conversion Closing, then the remaining portion of the Pre-Lease Rent attributable to the periods from and after the Conversion Closing Date will thereafter be credited to and constitute Rent for such Master Lease Site for the corresponding periods after such Conversion Closing Date; and provided, further, that such allocation of Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall in no event fail to qualify for the uneven rent test provided for in Treasury Regulations ss.1.467-3(c)(4). For each calendar month during the Term as to each Site, the Sprint Collocator at each Site will pay the Sprint Collocation Charge with respect to the Sprint Collocation Space for such Site (or if there is more than one Tower at such Site on which Sprint maintains Sprint Collocation Space, with respect to the Sprint Collocation Space of each Tower at such Site), in advance on the first day of each such month, beginning on the Effective Date. Lessee agrees that, except pursuant to the terms of Sections 4(f) and 41 and any provision contained in the Agreement to Lease and Sublease that expressly provides for the same, the Rent and the Pre-Lease Rent are non-refundable and that Lessee will have no right of abatement, reduction, setoff, counterclaim, rescission, refund, defense or deduction with respect thereto. The Sprint Collocators each agree that they will have no right of abatement (except as set forth in Section 14), reduction, setoff, counterclaim, rescission, refund, defense or deduction with respect to any payment of the Sprint Collocation Charge (including any Shared Ground Rent Increase Payment) or any amount payable by a Sprint Collocator pursuant to Section 11(g). (b) The following terms will have the following definitions: "Pre-Lease Rent" means, as to any Pre-Lease Site, the amount prepaid by Lessee to Lessor with respect to such Pre-Lease Site pursuant to this Agreement and as specified in Exhibit H, and "Rent" means, as to any Master Lease Site, the amount prepaid by Lessee to Lessor with respect to such Master Lease Site pursuant to this Agreement and as specified in Exhibit H (and as credited in Section 11(a)). Pre-Lease Rent and Rent are intended to constitute "fixed rent" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations ss.1.467-1(h)(3)). "Sprint Collocation Charge" means, as to any Sprint Collocation Space at any Site, the monthly amount payable to Lessee by the applicable Sprint Collocator for the sublease, use and occupancy, as applicable, of the Sprint Collocation Space at such Site pursuant to this Agreement in an amount equal to $1,400 per month subject to an annual increase on each CPI Change Date equal to the lesser of (a) three percent (3%) or (b) the applicable CPI Change plus two percent (2%). (c) If the Effective Date is a day other than the first day of a calendar month, the applicable Sprint Collocation Charge for the period from the Effective Date through the end of the calendar month during which the Effective Date occurs will be prorated on a daily basis, and will be included in the calculation of and payable with the Sprint Collocation Charge for the first full calendar month of the Term. If the date of the expiration of the Term as to any Site is a day other than the last day of a calendar month, the applicable Sprint Collocation Charge for such calendar month will be prorated on a daily basis. On the Effective Date, the aggregate number of Sites for which the Sprint Collocation Charge is payable on the Effective Date shall not be less than the number of Sites determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 2.6(h) of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease. 33
(d) If any Sprint Collocator does not pay all or any portion of the Sprint Collocation Charge (the "Unpaid Amount") or any Ongoing Revenue Sharing Payment when due and payable, the Sprint Collocator will pay Lessee a late charge equal to the product of (i) the lesser of (A) the Prime Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.5%) or (B) twelve percent (12%) per annum and (ii) the Unpaid Amount calculated for each day from the date on which the outstanding Unpaid Amount was due until the date of payment of such Unpaid Amount in full. (e) Notwithstanding that Rent and Pre-Lease Rent shall be prepaid in accordance with Section 11(a), the Parties agree that, for Tax purposes only, the Allocated Rent for each Site shall represent and be the amount of Rent or Pre-Lease Rent, as applicable, for which Lessee becomes liable on account of the use of each applicable Site for each calendar year, in whole or in part, of the Term. (f) It is the intention of the Parties that the allocation of Rent or Pre-Lease Rent to each Rent Payment Period as provided in Exhibit H constitutes a specific allocation of fixed rent within the meaning of Treasury regulations ss. 1.467-1(c)(2)(ii)(A), with the effect that pursuant to Treasury regulation ss.ss. 1.467-1(d) and 1.467-2, Lessor and Lessee, on any federal income tax returns filed by each of them (or on any Tax return on which their income is included), shall accrue the amounts of rental income and rental expense, respectively, set forth for each Rent Payment Period in Exhibit H under the caption "Proportional Rent." Because Lessee is prepaying the Rent or Pre-Lease Rent in respect of each Site for the entire Term pursuant to Section 11(a), there shall be considered to exist a loan from Lessee to Lessor for purposes of Section 467 of the Code with respect to each Site equal to the amount set forth in Exhibit H under the caption "Section 467 Loan" (the "Section 467 Loan"). Lessor shall deduct interest expense and Lessee shall accrue interest income, in each case, in an amount equal to that set forth in Exhibit H under the caption "Section 467 Interest" for the applicable Rent Payment Period. In no event shall any principal or interest on any Section 467 Loan be separately payable as such (including upon any termination of this Agreement with respect to a Site), it being agreed and understood that these items represent characterizations for Tax purposes only, and in no event whatsoever shall Lessee be entitled to a reduction of, or offset against, the amounts of Rent and Pre-Lease Rent payable pursuant to Section 11(a). (g) Each Sprint Collocator shall pay, as additional collocation rent, to Lessee, (i) within fifteen (15) Business Days after demand by Lessee (accompanied by reasonable evidence that such amounts are due and payable to the applicable Ground Lessors), an amount equal to one half (1/2) of (A) the lump sum amount necessary to be paid to lessors under any applicable Ground Leases in order to relieve Lessee of any obligation to pay Revenue Sharing Payments under such Ground Leases during the entire Term as to the Site covered by any such Ground Lease, and (B) any Ongoing Revenue Sharing Payment during the Term of this Agreement; provided, however, that if at the time Lessee notifies any Sprint Collocator of the existence and amount of such any Ongoing Revenue Sharing Payment, Lessee also notified the Sprint Collocator of the duration of such Ongoing Revenue Sharing Payment and the amount of and the dates on which such Ongoing Revenue Sharing Payments are due and payable to the Ground Lessor, Lessor will pay to the Ground Lessor or to Lessee for payment to the Ground Lessor (as directed by Lessee) the amount of such Ongoing Revenue Sharing Payments so payable on and before the date when they become due and payable for the duration of such payment period as designated by Lessee. Upon request by any Sprint Collocator, Lessee will provide Lessor with 34
such supporting documentation as such Sprint Collocator may reasonably require to evidence that any Revenue Sharing Payments are due and payable to any Ground Lessor. SECTION 12. Condition of the Sites and Obligations of Lessee. (a) Lessee acknowledges that, as between Lessor, Lessee and the Sprint Collocator, in respect of each Site, Lessee has the obligation, right and responsibility to repair and maintain such Site except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including without limitation, an obligation to monitor each Tower to maintain the structural integrity of the Tower and the ability of the Tower to hold and support all Communications Equipment then mounted on the Tower, in accordance with all applicable Laws and standard industry practices. Unless any Lessee Indemnitee has received payment for a claim for indemnification under Article 9 of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease related to such condition, Lessee shall have no obligation to perform any repair of a Site with respect to a condition existing prior to the date hereof. Subject to the other provisions contained in this Agreement, Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, will monitor, maintain and repair each Site such that the Sprint Collocator and Tower Subtenants may utilize such Site to the extent permitted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the markings on each Tower and the structural integrity of each Tower. Installation, maintenance and repair of each Site will comply in all material respects with all Laws and will be performed in a manner consistent with standard industry practices and so as to minimize any material disruption in the Sprint Collocator's business conducted, and use and operation of Sprint's Communications Equipment located, at such Site. Lessee assumes all responsibilities, as to each Site, for any fines, levies, and/or other penalties imposed as a result of non-compliance with such requirements of the applicable Governmental Authorities commencing from and after the Effective Date with such requirements of the applicable Governmental Authorities except for non-compliance caused by Sprint or its Affiliates that is not caused as a result of Lessee's failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Sprint assumes all responsibilities, as to each Site, for any fines, levies, and/or other penalties imposed as a result of Sprint's or its Affiliates past, current or future non-compliance with such requirements of the applicable Governmental Authorities. Subject to the terms of any applicable Collocation Agreement in existence as of the Effective Date, Lessee will use reasonable efforts to cause and (if a default would result under any applicable Ground Lease for a failure to cause) shall cause Tower Subtenants to maintain and repair all of its Communications Equipment on each Site in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement; provided, however that nothing herein will require Lessee to maintain any of Sprint's Communications Equipment or any Communications Equipment of Tower Subtenants to the extent that such Tower Subtenants are required to perform such maintenance. Without limiting the foregoing, Lessee at its own cost and expense, will make (or cause to be made) all Alterations to the Sites as may be required from time to time to meet in all material respects the requirements of applicable Laws except for the maintenance and repair work to be performed by the Sprint Collocator in accordance with clause (c) of this Section 12. (b) For each Site, Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, will provide Lessor, as applicable, all necessary and appropriate information reasonably requested by Lessor for Lessor to obtain (and Lessor will obtain within a reasonable amount of time) all of the certificates, permits, and other approvals which may be required in connection with FCC or FAA regulations. Lessee will also provide Lessor all appropriate information reasonably requested by Lessor pertaining to any easements or consents which are required from any third parties with respect to 35
the operation of such Site (to the extent different from the easements and consents needed prior to the Effective Date), including with respect to the lighting system serving such Site, and Lessor will cooperate with Lessee in connection with such actions, as contemplated by Section 18 (without requirement that Lessee expend any sums to obtain any such easement or consent). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Lessee will have no obligation to provide any information necessary for Lessor or any Sprint Collocator to obtain any certificate, permit or other approval relating to Sprint's Communications Equipment. If, as to any Site, any material certificate, permit, license, easement, or approval relating to the operation of such Site is canceled, expires, lapses, or is otherwise withdrawn or terminated (unless the same is the result of the acts or omissions of Lessor, any Sprint Collocator or their respective Affiliates, agents or employees) or, if Lessee has breached its obligation under this Section 12(b), then the applicable Sprint Collocator will have the right, in addition to its other remedies pursuant to this Agreement, at law, or in equity, to take appropriate action to remedy any such noncompliance and demand reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with such actions from Lessee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Lessee will have no obligation to obtain or restate (or otherwise provide information for Lessor or any Sprint Collocator to obtain or restate) any certificates, permits or approvals that (i) relate exclusively to Sprint's Communications Equipment or (ii) were rescinded due to a violation by any of the same by Lessor or any Sprint Collocator. Each applicable Sprint Collocator will, at all times, keep, operate and maintain Sprint's Communications Equipment at each Site in a safe condition, in good repair and in accordance with applicable Laws. (c) The following provisions will apply with respect to the lighting systems serving the Sites: For each Site, Lessee agrees to monitor the lighting system serving such Site and will notify the appropriate FAA service office of any lighting failure not existing on the Effective Date or at the time responsibility for such notification is assumed by Lessee under the Transition Services Agreement of even date herewith (the "Transition Services Agreement") in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law. In addition, Lessee agrees, as soon as practicable, to begin a diligent effort to repair any failed lighting in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law, and to notify Lessor and the applicable Sprint Collocator upon successful completion of the repair. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Lessee agrees to indemnify, defend and hold each Sprint Indemnitee harmless from and against any Claims arising out of or by reason of any failed lighting (unless such Claim is the result of the action or failure to act of Lessor, the Sprint Collocator or their respective Affiliates, agents or employees). In addition to and not in limitation of Sections 31(e) and (f), if Lessee defaults under this Section 12(c), Lessor or the Sprint Collocator, in addition to their other remedies pursuant to this Agreement, at law, or in equity, may elect to take appropriate action to repair or replace lights and invoice Lessee. In addition, Lessor may subject to arbitration of any dispute pursuant to the provisions of Section 31(h), terminate this Agreement as to such Site (i) if Lessor or Lessee is at any time fined by the FAA (pursuant to a final and non-appealable order) as a result of the occurrence of such default or (ii) if Lessor has given Lessee notice of such default under Section 31(e)(ii) and Lessee does not cure such default within the applicable cure period set forth in Section 31(e)(ii), within sixty (60) days of the occurrence of such event. The foregoing right may not be exercised by Lessor if (a) such fine occurs during a period where Lessor or a Sprint Collocator is still providing light monitoring service to Lessee with respect to 36
a Site and such fine results in whole or in part from the failure of Lessee to receive timely information with respect to the failure of a lighting system; (b) such fine occurs during a period where light monitoring service is being transitioned to Lessee and Lessee takes prompt action to address any non-compliance of which it is aware; (c) such fine or non-compliance or underlying failure of the lighting system results from actions or omissions of Sprint, its Affiliates or agents or (d) such fine or non-compliance results from the occurrence a force majeure event. Notwithstanding Lessor's agreement to provide such light monitoring service, Lessee will perform, at Lessee's sole cost and expense, all repair and maintenance associated with the lighting system at each Site. Without in any way affecting Lessee's obligations relating to lighting; (i) during the Term, the applicable Sprint Collocator will have the right, at its expense, to install and maintain equipment for the purpose of monitoring (x) the lighting system serving the Tower or the Improvements of each Site, and/or (y) any device of Lessee's used to monitor the lighting system serving each Tower (provided that none of the foregoing interferes with Lessee's monitoring of the lighting system at such Site or any of Tower Subtenant's use of the Site or does not otherwise result in any material increased costs to Lessee or any Tower Subtenant); and (ii) Lessee will have the right, at its expense, to install and maintain equipment for the purpose of monitoring any device of the Sprint Collocator used to monitor the lighting system servicing any Tower. (d) Without limiting Lessee's obligations under this Section 12 and the other provisions of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that each Sprint Collocator (or its Affiliate) is licensed by the FCC to provide telecommunications services and that the Sites are used to provide those services. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to transfer control of any FCC authorization held by any Sprint Collocator (or its Affiliate) to Lessee with respect to telecommunications services provided by Sprint or to limit the right of any Sprint Collocator (or its Affiliate) to take all necessary actions to comply with its obligations as an FCC licensee or with any other legal obligations to which it is or may become subject (subject to the other terms of this Agreement with respect to actions Sprint may take with respect to a Site). SECTION 13. Requirements for Alterations; Title to Alterations; Addition of Equipment; Work on the Site. (a) All Alterations that are made to a Site (whether required or optional), including, without limitation, Alterations made to the Sprint Collocation Space of a Site to the extent required to be performed by Lessee, will comply with the requirements of Section 3(f) of this Agreement. Title to each Alteration will without further act or instrument be deemed to constitute a part of the Site and be subject to this Agreement unless such Alteration is a Severable Alteration. (b) Whenever Lessee makes Alterations to any Site; constructs, replaces, maintains or repairs the Tower and Improvements of any Site; installs, maintains, replaces or repairs, or causes Tower Subtenants to install, maintain, replace or repair, any Equipment; or reconstruct or restore the Leased Property (the "Lessee Work"), the following provisions will apply: (i) No Lessee Work will be commenced until all certificates, licenses, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals necessary for the Lessee Work, from all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction with respect to any Site or the Lessee Work 37
as set out in Section 3(f) of this Agreement, have been obtained. Lessor will reasonably cooperate with Lessee, at Lessee's sole cost and expense, as is reasonably necessary in connection with Lessee's obtaining all such certificates, licenses, permits, etc. required to be issued by any Governmental Authorities in connection with Lessee's Work. (ii) Lessee will commence and perform the Lessee Work in accordance with then-current industry-standard practices and procedures ("Standard Procedures"). (iii) Lessee will cause the Lessee Work to be done and completed in a good, substantial and workmanlike manner and in compliance in all material respects with all Laws. Lessee will be solely responsible for construction means, methods, techniques, sequences and procedures, and for coordinating all activities related to the Lessee Work, and neither Lessor nor any Sprint Collocator will have any duty or obligation to inspect the Lessee Work, but will have the right to do so, at reasonable times, upon reasonable prior notice and in a reasonable manner. (iv) Lessee will promptly commence the Lessee Work and, once commenced, diligently and continually pursue the Lessee Work and complete the Lessee Work within a reasonable time. Lessee will assign such qualified personnel to the Lessee Work as may be necessary to cause the Lessee Work to be completed in an expeditious fashion. (v) All Lessee Work will be performed at Lessee's sole cost and expense. Lessee will provide and pay for all labor, materials, goods, supplies, equipment, appliances, tools, construction equipment and machinery and other facilities and services necessary for the proper execution and completion of the Lessee Work. Lessee will promptly pay when due all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Lessee Work. Lessee will pay, or cause to be paid, all fees and Taxes required by Law in connection with the Lessee Work. (vi) Lessee will be responsible for initiating and maintaining all necessary safety precautions and programs in connection with the Lessee Work, and will take necessary protections in accordance with Standard Procedures to prevent damage, injury or loss to, the Lessee Work, all persons performing Lessee Work on the Site, all other persons who may be involved in or affected by the Lessee Work, and all materials and equipment to be incorporated in the Lessee Work, Tower and Improvements of such Site. (vii) Lessee will procure and maintain in full force and effect, and will cause its contractors and subcontractors to procure and maintain in full force and effect, with respect to the Lessee Work: (x) in the case of Lessee only but subject to Section 24, full replacement cost "all-risk", "builder's risk" insurance, insuring the Lessee Work; and (y) the other types of insurance required to be maintained pursuant to Section 24 of this Agreement. Such additional insurance policies will meet the requirements set forth elsewhere in this Agreement with respect to the insurance policies otherwise required to be obtained and maintained by Lessee under this Agreement. SECTION 14. Damage to the Site, Tower or the Improvements. 38
(a) If there occurs a casualty which damages or destroys all or a Substantial Portion of any Site, then within thirty (30) days after the date of the casualty, Lessee shall notify Lessor in writing as to whether the Site is a Non-Restorable Site (it being understood Lessee may waive any condition in the definition of Non-Restorable Site, if it believes in good faith that Restoration may be commenced (and a building permit issued) within one year), which notice will specify in detail the reasons for such determination by Lessee, and if such Site is not a Non-Restorable Site the estimated time, in Lessee's reasonable judgment, for Restoration of the Site (a "Casualty Notice"). If Lessee fails to give Casualty Notice to Lessor within such thirty (30) day period, the affected Site shall be deemed not to be a Non-Restorable Site. If Lessor or the applicable Sprint Contributor disagrees with any determination of Lessee in the Casualty Notice that the Site is a Non-Restorable Site, Lessor or the applicable Sprint Contributor (as applicable) may institute arbitration proceedings to determine any such matter in the manner described in Section 31(h). If such Site is a Non-Restorable Site, then (i) either Lessee or the applicable Sprint Collocator shall have the right to terminate the applicable Sprint Collocator's leaseback or other use and occupancy of the Sprint Collocation Space at such Site, upon written notice to the applicable Sprint Collocator and such leaseback or other use and occupancy at such Site shall terminate as of the date of such Notice and (ii) Lessor or the applicable Sprint Contributor, as applicable, will have the right to terminate this Agreement as to such Site by written notice to Lessee within thirty (30) days after receipt of such written notice from Lessee, whereupon the Term as to such Site will automatically expire as of the date of such notice of termination and, if such right is exercised, the applicable Sprint Collocator's leaseback or other use and occupancy of the Sprint Collocation Space shall be terminated by written notice to Lessee within thirty (30) days after receipt of such written notice from Lessee, whereupon the Sprint Collocator's rights and obligations as to the leaseback or other use and occupancy of Sprint Collocation Space at such Site will automatically expire as of the date of such notice of termination. In all instances Lessee shall have the sole right to retain all insurance Proceeds related to a Non-Restorable Site and any other Site. (b) If there occurs, as to any Site, a casualty which damages or destroys (i) all or a Substantial Portion of such Site and the Site is not a Non-Restorable Site, or (ii) less than a Substantial Portion of any Site, Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, will promptly and diligently commence with the adjustment of Lessee's insurance Claims with respect to such event within a period of thirty (30) days after the date of the damage and, thereafter, promptly commence, and diligently prosecute to completion, the Restoration of the same. The Restoration will be carried on and completed in accordance with the provisions and conditions of this Section 14. (c) If Lessee is required to restore any Site in accordance with Section 14(b), all Proceeds of Lessee's insurance will be held by Lessee or the Lessee Lender and applied to the payment of the costs of the Restoration and will be paid out from time to time as the Restoration progresses. Any portion of the Proceeds of Lessee's insurance applicable to a particular Site remaining after final payment has been made for work performed on such Site will be retained by and be the property of Lessee. If the cost of Restoration exceeds the Proceeds of Lessee's insurance, Lessee will pay the excess cost. (d) Without limiting Lessee's obligations under this Agreement in respect of a Site subject to a casualty, if Lessee is required to cause the Restoration of a Site that has suffered a casualty, Lessee will make available to the Sprint Collocator a portion of the Leased Property of 39
such Site for the purpose of the Sprint Collocator's locating, at its sole cost and expense, a temporary communications facility, and will give the Sprint Collocator priority over Tower Subtenants at such Site as to the use of such portion; provided, however, that (i) the placement of such temporary communications facility will not interfere in any material respect with Lessee's Restoration or the continued operations of any Tower Subtenant; (ii) the Sprint Collocator will obtain any permits and approvals, at the Sprint Collocator's cost, required for the location of such temporary communications facility on such Site; and (iii) there must be Available Space on the Site for locating such temporary communications facility. (e) If Lessee fails at any time to diligently pursue the substantial completion of the Restoration of the Site required under this Agreement (subject to delay for force majeure events other than inability to obtain Governmental Approvals), the Sprint Collocator may, in addition to any other available remedy, terminate this Agreement as to the Sprint Collocator's leaseback or other use and occupancy of the Sprint Collocation Space at the applicable Site upon giving Lessee written notice of its election to terminate at any time prior to completion of the Restoration. (f) From and after any casualty as to any Site described in this Section 14 and during the period of Restoration at a Site, the Sprint Collocation Charge with respect to such Site will abate until completion of the Restoration. (g) The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 14 is in lieu of and supersedes any statutory requirements under the laws of any State applicable to the matters set forth in this Section 14. SECTION 15. Tower Subtenants; Interference. (a) Lessee acknowledges and agrees that Lessee will not permit the addition of any Tower Subtenants at any Site if such addition would materially and adversely affect the operation of Sprint's Communications Equipment installed prior to such Tower Subtenant's addition and the Sprint Collocator's operation, use or enjoyment of any Sprint Collocation Space on such Site, taking into account customary and commercially reasonable practices for multi-tenant wireless communication sites and towers. (b) Lessee will not and will not permit any Tower Subtenant at any Site to (i) install or change, alter or improve the frequency, power, or type of the Communications Equipment that materially and adversely interferes with the operation of Sprint's Communications Equipment in existence on such Site as of the date of such installation, change, alteration or improvement or is not authorized by, or violates, any applicable Laws or is not made or installed in accordance with good engineering practices (and Lessee will require any Tower Subtenant who subleases, licenses, or uses any portion of a Site to covenant to comply with the foregoing); or (ii) implement a configuration which materially and adversely interferes with the operation of Sprint's Communications Equipment on such Site in existence as of the date of such implementation. (c) If any Tower Subtenant installs or operates any Communications Equipment which is in violation of, any Laws, Lessee will cause such Tower Subtenant to shut down such 40
Communications Equipment as promptly as practicable (but in any event within fifteen (15) days after having actual knowledge thereof), failing which Lessee will shut down such Communications Equipment. (d) If any interference at any Site (at levels above commercially acceptable levels of interference at multi-tenant wireless communication sites) occurs as a result of actions of Lessee or Tower Subtenants described in Section 15(b) above as to any Site, Lessee will be responsible for coordinating and resolving any such interference problems caused by Lessee or Tower Subtenants at such Site, including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to correct and eliminate the interference within two (2) Business Days of receipt of notification from the Sprint Collocator and perform an interference study in accordance with then-current industry-standard procedures. If the interference cannot be corrected or eliminated within such two (2) Business Days period, Lessee will cause, at Lessee's option, any of Lessee's or Tower Subtenants' Communications Equipment or Communications Facility that interferes with the operation of Sprint's Communications Facility's authorized frequency spectrum or signal strength, to be immediately powered down or turned off, with the right to turn such interfering Communications Equipment or facility back up or on only during off-peak hours in order to determine whether such interference continues or has been eliminated; provided, that if any interference continues at the time the power output of the interfering Communications Equipment is powered down, the Communications Equipment that interferes with the operation of Sprint's Communication Facility or the Sprint Collocation Space will be turned off. If Lessee or any Tower Subtenant cannot reasonably correct or eliminate such interference within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice from the Sprint Collocator, Lessee will or will cause such Tower Subtenant to cease the operations of the applicable Communications Equipment and to stop providing services from the applicable Communications Facility or the Leased Property at the applicable Site in its entirety until the interference problems are resolved. (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15, (i) the obligations of Lessee hereunder as to any Site are subject to the rights of any Tower Subtenant under any Collocation Agreement in existence as of the Effective Date at such Site, and to the extent that the provisions of any such Collocation Agreement prohibits Lessee from performing the obligations of Lessee hereunder, Lessee will be required to perform such obligations only to the extent permitted under such Collocation Agreement and shall have no liability with respect thereto to any Sprint Collocator and (ii) Lessee shall have no obligation to enforce any rights under a Collocation Agreement against an Affiliate of Sprint. (f) The applicable Sprint Collocator will not, as to any Site, (i) install or change, alter or improve the frequency, power, or type of Sprint's Communications Equipment that materially and adversely interferes with the operation of any Tower Subtenant's Communications Equipment in existence on such Site as of the date of such installation, change, alteration or improvement or is not authorized by, or violates, any applicable Laws or is not made or installed in accordance with good engineering practices or otherwise violates the terms of any Collocation Agreement existing on the Effective Date; or (ii) implement a configuration which materially and adversely interferes with the operation of any Tower Subtenant's Communications Equipment on such Site in existence as of the date of such implementation. 41
(g) If the Sprint Collocator installs or operates any Communications Equipment which is not authorized by, or is in violation of, any Laws, the Sprint Collocator will remove such Communications Equipment as promptly as practicable (but in any event within fifteen (15) days after having actual knowledge thereof). (h) If any interference (at levels above commercially acceptable levels of interference at multi-tenant wireless communication sites) occurs as a result of actions of the Sprint Collocator described in Section 15(f) above as to Sprint's Communications Equipment at any Site, the Sprint Collocator will be responsible for coordinating and resolving any such interference problems caused by the Sprint Collocator, including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to correct and eliminate the interference within two (2) Business Days of receipt of notification from Lessee and perform an interference study in accordance with then-current industry-standard procedures. If the interference cannot be corrected or eliminated within such two (2) Business Day period, the Sprint Collocator will cause any of Sprint's Communications Equipment that interferes with the operation of any Tower Subtenant's Communications Facility's authorized frequency spectrum or signal strength, to be immediately powered down or turned off, with the right to turn such interfering Communications Equipment or facility back up or on only during off-peak hours specified by Lessee in order to determine whether such interference continues or has been eliminated; provided, that if any interference continues at the time the power output of the interfering Communications Equipment is powered down, the Communications Equipment that interferes with the operation of the applicable Tower Subtenant's Communication Facility will be turned off. If the Sprint Collocator cannot correct or eliminate such interference within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice from Lessee, the Sprint Collocator will cease the operations of the applicable Communications Equipment and to stop providing services from the Sprint's Communications Facility or the Sprint Collocation Space of the applicable Site in its entirety until the interference problems are resolved. SECTION 16. Taxes. (a) Subject to Sections 16(b) and (c) and 39(b), and except as provided below, Lessee will be responsible for all Taxes upon or with respect to (A) any of the Leased Property, any portion of such Leased Property, or any interest therein, (B) the acquisition, purchase, sale, financing, leasing, subleasing, ownership, maintenance, repair, redelivery, alteration, insuring, control, use, operation, delivery, possession, repossession, location, storage, refinancing, refund, transfer of title, registration, reregistration, transfer of registration, return, or other disposition of any of the Leased Property or any portion of such Leased Property, or interest in such Leased Property, (C) the rental payments, receipts, or earnings arising from the Leased Property, any portion of such Leased Property, or any interest in such Leased Property, or payable pursuant to this Agreement, or any other payment or right to receive payment pursuant to any related document, or (D) any Alteration, removal, substitution, maintenance, or repair of any of the Leased Property. Subject to Sections 16(b) and (c) and 39(b), and except as provided below, Lessee will be responsible for all Taxes upon or with respect to each Site applicable to all periods occurring after the Effective Date and during the Term as to such Site. Lessee will receive any refunds for Taxes paid by Lessee pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee will not be required to pay any Taxes payable with respect to a Leased Site or Other Interest Site, if the applicable Ground Lease provides that the Ground Lessor is responsible for such Taxes without pass-through to the applicable ground lessee and the Ground 42
Lessor actually pays any such Taxes. If the Ground Lessor does not pay any such Taxes and either Party becomes aware of it, the Parties will, at Lessee's expense, cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Ground Lessor to pay such Taxes. (b) In the taxable periods occurring during the Term as to any Site, any Taxes (determined without regard to the Term) for which Lessee is responsible under this Section 16 and that are calculated or assessed on the basis of a time period any portion of which is not included within the Term as to such Site (e.g., Property Taxes assessed annually) will be prorated proportionately between Sprint and Lessee based on the number of days in each such period during the time period of assessment that is included within the Term as to such Site. Lessee's obligations for Taxes under this Section 16 will be limited to that proportionate amount of such Taxes attributable to the period during which this Agreement is in effect with respect to such Site; provided, that any Taxes resulting from special assessments or appraisals of any Site occurring during the period during which this Agreement is in effect will be the sole responsibility of Lessee. Any other Taxes that are not calculated or assessed on the basis of a time period, but for which Lessee is responsible under Sections 16 or 39(b), will be prorated using a fair and equitable proration method that considers, among other things, the basis upon which such Taxes are assessed. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 16 or in Section 39, the Parties agree as follows with respect to Property Taxes: (i) Lessor or Sprint will prepare all returns with respect to Property Taxes in the ordinary course and with the same degree of diligence that it exercises with respect to similar tax compliance matters; (ii) Lessor or Sprint will pay all Property Taxes on a timely basis to the appropriate Governmental Authority and Lessee shall have no responsibility for Property Taxes other than with respect to the Lessee Property Tax Charge and Landlord Reimbursement Taxes, (iii) for each calendar year, or portion thereof, that is included in the Term as to each Site, Lessee will pay to Lessor the Lessee Property Tax Charge on or before July 1 of the respective calendar year; provided that if the Effective Date is after July 1, the payment for the first calendar year (or portion thereof) shall be made on the Effective Date; provided further that if the Term ends prior to July 1, the payment for the final year shall be made on the last day of the Term; and (iv) by June 15 of each calendar year, Lessor will provide Lessee with an officer's certificate in the form of Exhibit D. Lessor, Lessee and Sprint will cooperate with each other, and make available to each other such information as will reasonably be necessary, in connection with the preparation of tax returns for Property Taxes and any audit or judicial or administrative proceeding relating to the same. Lessee will be responsible for all Landlord Reimbursement Taxes for which the applicable Ground Lessor seeks reimbursement under the provisions of the Ground Lease after the Effective Date and during the Term with respect to each Site; provided, however, the Parties will prorate such amounts relating to tax periods that include the Effective Date or the Site Expiration Date in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 16(b) and the paying Party will be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying Party for the non-paying Party's portion of the Landlord Reimbursement Taxes paid, and provided further that, with respect to the twelve month period beginning on the Effective Date, Lessor will reimburse Lessee for the amount of the aggregate Landlord Reimbursement Taxes paid by Lessee (prorated for such twelve month period with the actual amount of Landlord Reimbursement Taxes during 2005 and 2006 straightlined) that exceed the product of $200 multiplied by the number of Sites. To the extent either Party is entitled to reimbursement from the other Party for the payment of prorated Landlord 43
Reimbursement Taxes, such reimbursement shall be due within fifteen (15) days of the presentation of a statement reflecting amounts due and appropriate other documentation supporting the calculation and payment of such amounts to the applicable Ground Lessor. In the event of (1) the non-payment of Taxes when due (unless such Taxes are being contested in good faith and there is no material risk of forfeiture of any Site as a result of such non-payment of Taxes) by Lessor or any of its Affiliates, which could result in a material risk of forfeiture of a Site (in which case, Lessor will promptly notify Lessee when Lessor becomes aware of such event) or (2) the failure by Lessor to deliver the certificate required to be delivered under clause (iv) of the first sentence of Section 16(c) with respect to any Site by July 15 of the calendar year, Lessee may notify Lessor in writing of the non-payment of Taxes and request that Lessor or its Affiliates take action within 90 days to pay such Taxes and remove any Liens ("90 Day Lessee Notice"). Within 90 days after receipt of the 90 Day Lessee Notice, Lessor will provide evidence to Lessee to support that Lessor or its Affiliates have paid such Taxes and started the process of removing any Lien or have contested such Taxes in good faith with the appropriate Governmental Authority and are diligently prosecuting such contest, and there is no material risk of forfeiture of the Site. In the case of a contest, Lessor will provide periodic updates to Lessee at least every 30 days thereafter until Lessor provides evidence that such Lien has been removed. In the event that Lessor or its Affiliates have elected to contest a Tax on a Site in accordance with the provisions of this Section, Lessor agrees that it or its Affiliates will pay all Taxes and take all actions necessary to remove any Lien within the time provided by the appropriate Governmental Authority after a final determination. If, on the ninety-first day after receipt of the 90 Day Lessee Notice, the Lessor or its Affiliates have not (x) paid such Taxes and otherwise started the process of removing any Lien or (y) taken action to contest such Taxes and continuously prosecuted such contest, and there is no material risk of the forfeiture of the Site, the Lessee may (but shall be under no obligation to) pay the Tax and cure any Lien by taking any reasonable action necessary. Lessor will reimburse Lessee for all costs incurred in paying such Taxes within 15 days of the presentation to Lessor by Lessee of written documentation evidencing the payment of such Taxes and the removal of any Lien for which Lessee is requesting reimbursement. If, at any time after delivery of the 90 Day Lessee Notice, a material risk of forfeiture of the Site arises, Lessor shall give prompt notice to Lessee and (whether or not Lessor has provided such notice) Lessee shall have the right to purchase the individual Site that is the subject of the proceeding for a purchase price of $100 by giving Lessor written notice of its exercise of such purchase option (provided that in the case of a 90 Day Lessee Notice described in clause (1) above, such purchase option shall not be exercisable (j) until 10 days after the earlier of the Lessee delivery of the 90 Day Lessee Notice and Lessor having actual knowledge of the event giving rise to such 90 Day Lessee Notice, and (k) unless the material risk of forfeiture is continuing), and such option shall be exercised pursuant to the provisions of Section 36, mutatis mutandis, except that the Option Purchase Price shall be $100 and shall apply only with respect to the individual Site. (d) Any excise, sales, use, value added, registration, stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, transfer, gains and similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements will be borne by Lessee. Lessee will provide Lessor with a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E. The Parties will cooperate in providing each other with any additional exemption certifications and other similar documentation as appropriate. The Party that is required by applicable Law to file 44
the tax returns with respect to any applicable Transfer Taxes will do so at its own expense, and the other Parties will cooperate with respect thereto as necessary. SECTION 17. Utilities. Except as set forth to the contrary below in this Section 17, Lessor will have no obligation to make arrangements for or to pay any charges for connection or use of utilities and similar services to any Site, including but not limited to, electricity, telephone, power, and other utilities. As among the Sprint Collocator and all new Tower Subtenants, Lessee will cause utility charges to be separately metered. The Sprint Collocator will pay to the applicable utility service provider the charges for all separately metered utility services used by the Sprint Collocator at each Site in the operation of Sprint's Communications Facility at such Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 17, if the applicable utility service provider will not render a separate bill for the Sprint Collocator's usage, the Sprint Collocator will reimburse Lessee monthly for the Sprint Collocator's actual metered usage at the rate charged to Lessee by the applicable utility service provider, or if Lessee is prohibited from installing a separate meter to measure the Sprint Collocator's usage, the Sprint Collocator may use Lessee's utility sources to provide utility service to the Communications Facility, and the Sprint Collocator will reimburse Lessee monthly for the Sprint Collocator's actual usage at the rate charged to Lessee by the applicable service provider (and Lessee and the Sprint Collocator agree to cooperate in determining a method by which to measure or estimate the Sprint Collocator's usage if the usage is not capable of actual measurement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Lessee shall have no obligation to provide, maintain or pay for utility services related to Sprint's Communication Equipment. Sprint shall pay for all utility services utilized by Sprint and its Affiliates in its operations at each Site prior to delinquency. For all Sites where a Sprint Collocator leases Sprint Collocation Space, Sprint and Lessee have agreed to a arrangement in a separate agreement for the segregation and transfer of responsibility for electrical service serving the lighting system serving each Site from the Sprint Collocators to Lessee. In connection with such arrangement, each Sprint Collocator agrees to pay the utility costs for such electrical power as follows. If not prohibited by applicable Laws, the Sprint Collocators shall allow Lessee to access the Sprint Collocator's (or other Person occupying the Sprint Collocation Space's) power sources at all Sites with lighting systems in order to install lighting monitoring equipment and maintain Tower lighting as required under this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement. Accessing such power sources shall be at Lessee's sole cost and expense. The cost of all power provided to Lessee shall be at no cost or expense to Lessee. During each of the first four (4) years of the Term of this Agreement, Lessee shall obtain its own power source for its lighting and lighting monitoring equipment and transition from using power of the Sprint Collocators (or other Persons occupying the Sprint Collocation Space) for the Sites requiring lighting monitoring equipment (approximately [1,100] Sites) as of the Effective Date at a rate of twenty-five percent (25%) of such Sites by the end of each of the first four (4) years of the Term of this Agreement, all as to be more fully described in the Transition Services Agreement. SECTION 18. Governmental Permits. (a) In addition to and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 12(a) of this Agreement, Lessee will, at its own cost and expense, provide to Lessor and any Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates all necessary and appropriate information reasonably requested by Lessor or such 45
Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates to obtain and maintain in effect all certificates, permits, licenses and other approvals relating to FAA or FCC regulations and Lessee will, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect all certificates, permits, licenses and other approvals (other than those relating to FCC and FAA regulations) and comply with all Laws, required or imposed by Governmental Authorities (other than those relating to FCC or FAA regulations), in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Leased Property at each Site (including the Tower on such Site). As part of Lessee's obligation to provide information, Lessee will provide Lessor and any Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates access to data reasonably necessary to monitor the lighting systems at each Site to the extent in Lessee's possession (to the extent the Sprint Collocator is not already independently monitoring the same). (b) Lessee will reasonably cooperate with any Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates in their efforts to obtain and maintain in effect any certificates, permits, licenses and other approvals and to comply with any Laws required or imposed on such Sprint Collocator by Governmental Authorities applicable to the Sprint Collocation Space of each Site. (c) Each applicable Sprint Collocator will, at its own cost and expense, obtain and maintain or cause to be maintained in effect all material certificates, permits, licenses and other approvals and comply with all Laws required or imposed by Governmental Authorities in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Sprint Collocation Space of each Site, including, without limitation, FCC regulations. The cost of obtaining and maintaining such FCC or FAA permits or approvals will be reimbursed to Lessor in accordance with Section 18(f). (d) Lessor and each applicable Sprint Collocator will reasonably cooperate with Lessee in Lessee's efforts to provide required information and to comply with all Laws required or imposed by Governmental Authorities applicable to each Site. (e) Lessor and any Sprint Collocator will be afforded access, at reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice, to all of Lessee's records, books, correspondence, instructions, blueprints, permit files, memorandum and similar data relating to the compliance of the Towers with all applicable Laws or if Lessor or any Sprint Collocator otherwise provides reasonable justification therefore, except privileged documents or where disclosure is prohibited by Law. Lessee will also provide Lessor or any Sprint Collocator with an electronic interface or other real time access to Lessee's Tower administration database which will enable access to detailed information concerning collocations. Any information described in this Section 18(e) will be open for inspection upon reasonable notice by Lessor or such Sprint Collocator, at its cost, and its authorized representatives at reasonable hours at Lessee's principal office and will be retained by Lessee for period of three (3) years after the expiration of this Agreement. (f) The cost of Lessor's or any Sprint Collocator's or its Affiliates obtaining and maintaining all FCC and FAA permits and approvals relating to the operation and maintenance of the Leased Property of each Site (excluding the Sprint Collocation Space) and Lessee Work, in each case, after the Effective Date, will be borne by Lessee in accordance with Sections 13(b)(i) and 18(c) (the "Reimbursable Costs"). Lessor will provide Lessee with an invoice for Reimbursable Costs on a monthly basis, which amount will be paid by Lessee to Lessor or the applicable Sprint Collocator, as applicable, within twenty (20) Business Days of Lessee's receipt of such invoice. 46
SECTION 19. No Liens. (a) Lessee will not create or permit any Lien (other than Lessee Permitted Liens) against any Site, or any part of any Site. If any such Lien created or permitted by Lessee (other than Lessee Permitted Liens) is filed against all or any part of any Site, Lessee will be required to cause the same to be discharged by payment, satisfaction or posting of bond within thirty (30) days only (i) after Lessee has obtained knowledge of such Lien and (ii) Lessee has elected not to contest such Lien in accordance with Section 19(b) hereof. If Lessee fails, after notice and opportunity to cure, to cause any Lien not being contested as provided in Section 19(b) (other than Lessee Permitted Liens) to be discharged within the permitted time, Lessor may cause it to be discharged and may pay the amount of such Lien in order to do so. If Lessor makes any such payment, all amounts paid by Lessor will be payable by Lessee to Lessor within ten (10) days of demand. (b) To the extent not prohibited under any applicable Ground Lease, Lessee may, at Lessee's sole cost and expense, in its own name and on its own behalf or in the name of and on behalf of Lessor, in good faith, contest any claim of Lien and, in the event of any such contest, may permit such claim of Lien so contested to remain unpaid, unsatisfied and undischarged during the period of such contest and any appeal from such contest; provided, that, if any portion of any Site is subject to imminent danger of loss or forfeiture by virtue of or by reason of such claim of Lien, such claim of Lien will be complied with as promptly as practicable, but in any event prior to any loss or forfeiture. Lessor, at the sole cost and expense of Lessee, will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate fully with Lessee in any such contest. (c) Any Secured Lessee Loan (including any Mortgage execute in connection therewith) will be subject to each and every term, covenant, condition, agreement, requirement, restriction and provision set forth in this Agreement and subject to all rights of Lessor hereunder. (d) Lessor will execute any necessary easement or right of way for utilities for any Owned Site promptly following any request by Lessee, provided such easement or right of way does not have an adverse effect on any Sprint Collocator's use or enjoyment of the Sprint Collocation Space of such Site or on the ownership by Lessor of the Tower on such Site, including without limitation, the operation of Sprint's Communications Equipment on such Site. (e) No Sprint Collocator will create or permit (or allow any of its Affiliates to create or permit) any Lien arising by, through or under the Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates (other than Permitted Encumbrances) against Site, or any part of any Site. If any such Lien (other than Permitted Encumbrances) is filed against all or any part of any Site as a result of the acts or omissions of any Sprint Collocator or any of its Affiliates, such Sprint Collocator will cause the same to be discharged by payment, satisfaction or posting of bond within thirty (30) days after obtaining actual knowledge such Lien. If any such Sprint Collocator fails to cause any such Lien (other than Permitted Encumbrances) to be discharged within such thirty (30) day period, Lessee may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to such Sprint Collocator, cause such Lien to be discharged and may pay the amount of such Lien in order to do so. If Lessee makes any such payment, all amounts paid by Lessee will be payable by such Sprint Collocator to Lessee upon demand. 47
SECTION 20. Condemnation. (a) If there occurs a Taking of all or a Substantial Portion of any Site, other than a Taking for temporary use, then (i) Lessee will have the right to terminate this Agreement as to such Site by written notice to Lessor and the applicable Sprint Collocator within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of such Taking whereupon the Term will automatically expire as to such Site, on the Date of Taking, as if such date were the Site Expiration Date as to such Site and each Party shall be entitled to prosecute, claim and retain the entire Award attributable to its respective interest in such Site under this Agreement and (ii) the Sprint Collocator will have the right to terminate this Agreement as to the Sprint Collocator's leaseback or other use and occupancy of the Sprint Collocation Space by written notice to Lessee within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of such Taking, whereupon ) the Sprint Collocator's rights and obligations as to the leaseback or other use and occupancy of the Sprint Collocation Space at such Site will automatically expire as of the Date of Taking. (b) If there occurs a Taking of less than a Substantial Portion of any Site, then this Agreement and all duties and obligations of Lessee under this Agreement in respect of such Site will remain unmodified, unaffected and in full force and effect. Lessee will promptly proceed with the Restoration of the remaining portion of such Site (to the extent commercially feasible) to a condition substantially equivalent to its condition prior to the Taking. Lessee will be entitled to apply the Award received by Lessee to the Restoration of any Site from time to time as such work progresses; provided, that Sprint will be entitled to prosecute and claim an amount of any Award reflecting its interest under this Agreement. If the cost of the Restoration exceeds the Award recovered by Lessee, Lessee will pay the excess cost. If the Award exceeds the cost of the Restoration, the excess will be paid to Lessee. (c) If there occurs a Taking of any portion of any Site for temporary use, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect as to such Site for the remainder of the Term as to such Site; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, during such time as Lessee will be out of possession of such Site, if a Master Lease Site, or unable to operate such Site, if a Pre-Lease Site, by reason of such Taking, the failure to keep, observe, perform, satisfy and comply with those terms and conditions of this Agreement compliance with which are effectively impractical or impossible as a result of Lessee's being out of possession or unable to operate (as applicable) such Site will not be an event of default under this Agreement. The Award for any such temporary Taking payable for any period prior to the Site Expiration Date will be paid to Lessee and, for any period thereafter, to Lessor. (d) If there occurs a Taking of any Sprint Collocation Space of any Site or any portion of such Sprint Collocation Space, for temporary use, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect as to such Site for the remainder of the then-current Term; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, during such time as the Sprint Collocator will be out of possession of such Sprint Collocation Space by reason of such Taking, the failure by the Sprint Collocator to keep, observe, perform, satisfy, and comply with these terms and conditions of this Agreement compliance with which are effectively impractical or impossible as a result of the Sprint Collocator's being out of possession of such Sprint Collocation Space will not be an event of default under this Agreement, and, in addition, the 48
Sprint Collocator will not be liable for payment of the Sprint Collocation Charge during the period of the temporary Taking. SECTION 21. Waiver of Subrogation; Indemnity. (a) Except as provided in this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Lessor, Lessee and the Sprint Collocators hereby waive any and all rights of recovery, claim, action or cause of action against each other, their respective agents, officers and employees, for any loss or damage that may occur to any Site or their respective property at any Site, by reason of fire, the elements, or any other cause insured against, or required to be insured against, under the terms of policies of property insurance maintained, or required to be maintained, for such Site, by Lessor, Lessee or the applicable Sprint Collocator (as the case may be) under the terms of this Agreement, regardless of cause or origin. In addition, Lessor, Lessee and each Sprint Collocator will cause each such property insurance policy carried by them insuring the their respective property at each Site to provide that the insurer waives all rights of recovery by way of subrogation against any other Party hereto in connection with any loss or damage covered by the policy. (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 21(a) above, Lessee agrees to indemnify and to hold each Sprint Indemnitee harmless from any and all Claims suffered or incurred by such Sprint Indemnitee by reason of, or arising out of (i) any default, breach, performance or nonperformance by Lessee of its respective obligations and covenants under this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 13, 15 and 18; (ii) any Claims against any Sprint Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from (x) Lessee's use, operation, maintenance or occupancy of any part of the Site in violation of the terms of this Agreement or (y) any Tower Subtenant's use, operation, maintenance or occupancy of its Communications Facility in violation of the terms of this Agreement; (iii) any failure of Lessee to comply with any applicable Laws or with the directives of the FCC and FAA that Lessee is required to comply with pursuant to this Agreement or under applicable Laws; (iv) any Claims arising out of or resulting from Lessee's acts or omissions, or the acts or omissions of any of their respective agents, employees, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, licensees, or invitees; and (v) any other provision of this Agreement which provides that Lessee will indemnify and hold harmless any Sprint Indemnitee in respect of the matters contained in such provision. If any action or proceeding is brought against any Sprint Indemnitee by reason of any such Claim, Lessee upon notice from such Sprint Indemnitee, covenants and agrees to defend such action or proceeding at its expense. (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 21(a) above, the Sprint Collocators, on a joint and several basis, agree to indemnify and to hold each Lessee Indemnitee harmless from any and all Claims with respect to bodily injury, personal injury or property damage suffered or incurred by such Lessee Indemnitee by reason of, or arising out of (i) any default, breach, performance or nonperformance of the Sprint Collocator's obligations and covenants under this Agreement; (ii) any Claims against any Lessee Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from the Sprint Collocator's use, operation, maintenance or occupancy of Sprint's Communications Equipment or any portion of the Site (including the Sprint Collocation Space) in violation of the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the Sprint Collocator's failure to comply with any applicable Laws or with the directives of the FCC and FAA as to Sprint's Communications Equipment; (iv) any Claims against any Lessee 49

If any action or proceeding is brought against any Lessee Indemnitee by reason of any such Claim, the Sprint Collocator, upon notice from such Lessee Indemnitee, covenants and agrees to defend such action or proceeding at its expense. SECTION 22. Subordination of Mortgages. All Mortgages which at any time during the Term of this Agreement may be placed upon such Site or any portion of such Site and all documents and instruments evidencing and securing any Secured Lessee Loan, shall be subject and subordinate to the terms and conditions hereof. SECTION 23. Environmental Covenants.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event any Claim of a type giving rise to indemnification obligations under this Section 23 is asserted against a Lessee Indemnitee and it cannot be readily determined that it was the act or omission of Lessor or any Sprint Collocator or its Affiliate that gave rise to such Claim, it will be assumed for all purposes of this Section 23 that it was Lessee's or a Tower Subtenant's act or omission, Lessee will indemnify the Sprint Indemnitees in respect of such Claim pursuant to Section 23(e), and neither Lessor nor any Sprint Collocator will have any obligation or liability to any Lessee Indemnitee in respect of such Claim unless and until it is finally determined that Lessor's or a Sprint Collocator's act or omission gave rise to such Claim. The provisions of this Section 23 will survive the applicable Site Expiration Date or earlier termination of this Agreement. The foregoing provisions of this Section 23 are not intended to limit the generality of any of the other provisions of this Agreement. (i) During the Term, for any dispute or litigation that arises during the Term in connection with any Ground Lessor, Ground Lease, Collocation Agreement, Tower Subtenant or any other issue relating to the operation of the Sites (collectively, "Disputes"), Lessee shall have the right to control, prosecute, settle and/or compromise such Disputes; provided that Lessee shall not settle or compromise such Disputes (i) for which Lessee is seeking a claim for indemnification under the Agreement to Lease, (ii) which would increase the amounts owed under any Ground Lease or Collocation Agreement during the Term, which amounts Lessee is not obligated to pay hereunder during the Term, or (iii) result in the termination of any Ground Lease, without Sprint's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided further that if Sprint does reasonably withhold such consent, Lessee shall nevertheless have the right to settle and/or compromise such Dispute at Lessee's own expense. Upon request, Lessee shall keep Lessor reasonably informed of the status and of the activities relating to the Disputes. Lessee shall not be required to seek the consent of Sprint to settle any matter with a Ground Lessor that relates to the amount of a Revenue Sharing Payment, and such settlement shall not diminish Contributor's obligations under Section 11(h) with respect thereto. SECTION 24. Insurance. (a) For each Site, Lessee will procure, and will maintain in full force and effect at all times during the Term as to the applicable Site, the following types of insurance with respect to each Site, including the Tower and Improvements on such Site (but excluding Sprint's Communications Equipment), paying as the same become due all premiums for such insurance: (i) commercial general public liability insurance insuring against all liability of Lessee and Lessee's officers, employees, agents, licensees and invitees arising out of, by reason of or in connection with the use, occupancy or maintenance of each Site (including Tower and the Improvements), in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 for 53
bodily injury or property damage or as a result of one occurrence, and not less than $2,000,000 for bodily injury or property damage in the aggregate; (ii) umbrella or excess liability insurance with limits not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate; (iii) property insurance in an amount not less than full replacement cost of the Tower and Improvements of each Site, against direct and indirect loss or damage by fire and all other casualties and risks covered under "all risk" insurance respecting the Tower and Improvements (but excluding any of Sprint's Communications Equipment and Sprint's Improvements); and (iv) workers' compensation insurance covering all employees of Lessee and any employees of its Affiliates performing activities on the Site. (b) Lessee will pay all premiums for the insurance coverage which Lessee is required to procure and maintain under this Agreement. Each insurance policy (i) will name Lessor and the applicable Sprint Collocator as an additional insured; provided, that such requirement will only apply to liability policies and will have no application to workers' compensation policies; and (ii) will provide that the policy cannot be canceled as to Lessor or the Sprint Collocator except after the insurer gives Lessor or the Sprint Collocator, as applicable, thirty (30) days' written notice of cancellation. For each Site, Lessee will deliver to Lessor and the Sprint Collocator certificates of insurance evidencing the existence of all insurance which Lessee is required to maintain hereunder, such delivery to be made promptly after such insurance is obtained (but not later than the Effective Date) and not later than the date which is thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of any such insurance. (c) Each Sprint Collocator will procure, and will maintain in full force and effect at all times during the Term, the following types of insurance with respect to its Sprint Collocation Space at the Sites, paying as the same become due all premiums for such insurance: (1) commercial general public liability insurance insuring against all liability of the Sprint Collocator and its officers, employees, agents, licensees and invitees arising out of, by reason of or in connection with the use, occupancy or maintenance of the Sprint Collocation Space of each Site, in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 for bodily injury or property damage or as a result of one occurrence, and not less than $2,000,000 for bodily injury or property damage in the aggregate; (2) umbrella or excess liability insurance with limits not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate; and (3) workers' compensation insurance covering all employees of the Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates. (d) The applicable Sprint Collocator Sprint will pay all premiums for the insurance coverage which the Sprint Collocator is required to procure and maintain under this Agreement. Each insurance policy (i) will name Lessee as an additional insured; provided, however, that 54
such requirement will only apply to liability policies and will have no application to workers' compensation policies; and (ii) will provide that the policy cannot be canceled as to Lessee except after the insurer gives Lessee thirty (30) days' written notice of cancellation. Each Sprint Collocator will deliver to Lessee certificates of insurance evidencing the existence of all insurance which such Sprint Collocator is required to maintain hereunder, such delivery to be made promptly after such insurance is obtained (but not later than the Effective Date) and not later than the date which is thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of any such insurance. (e) All policy amounts set forth in this Section 24 will be evaluated and increased (if necessary) every five (5) years during the Term of this Agreement to such amounts as are customarily carried by prudent landlords and tenants in the telecommunications industry to insure risks associated with their respective interests in facilities comparable to the Sites. All policies of insurance required under this Section 24 will be written on companies rated "A:VII" by AM Best or a comparable rating and licensed in the State where the applicable Site to which such insurance applies is located. (f) Neither Lessee nor any Sprint Collocator will, on its own initiative or pursuant to the request or requirement of any Tower Tenant or other Person, take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required to be carried by such Party in this Section 24, unless the other Party is named in the policy as an additional insured. Each Party will immediately notify the other Party whenever any such separate insurance is taken out and will deliver to the other Party original certificates evidencing the same. SECTION 25. Sprint Right of Alteration and Substitution. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any Sprint Collocator will have the right (for the benefit of itself or its Affiliates) to modify and/or replace, at such Sprint Collocator's expense, Sprint's Communications Equipment at any Site so long as any such modification or replacement does not entail the installation of Communications Equipment on any portion of the Tower located outside the Sprint Tower Envelope that (i) materially differs in type or use from Sprint's Communications Equipment then located on the Tower at such Site, (ii) exceeds any limitations contained in Section 6(a), (iii) impairs the structural integrity of the Tower or (iii) violates the provisions of Section 15. If at any Site the Sprint Collocator desires to modify or replace any Communications Equipment on the Tower with Communications Equipment that materially differs in type or use from Sprint's Communications Equipment then located at such Site, such modification or replacement Communications Equipment may be installed only with the consent of Lessee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (and in connection with such consent Lessee may require the that such Sprint Collocator comply with a reasonable application process and perform such testing and analysis at the cost of the Sprint Collocator as would be customary in accordance with industry standard requirements). The Sprint Collocator at any Site also will have the right, at its cost and expense, to make any Alterations to the Site that it reasonably deems necessary to increase the capacity of or otherwise augment, strengthen or enhance a Tower, subject, however in the case of any structural Alterations to the submission of plans and specifications to Lessee at least thirty (30) days prior to undertaking any such Alteration, and the written approval of Lessee, not to be unreasonably withheld. Any Alterations to a Site shall not adversely impact any existing Tower Subtenant or materially diminish the marketability of space at a Site to future tower subtenants, have the 55
practical effect of limiting the number of potential Tower Subtenants or the amount of Available Space on the Tower for potential use by prospective Tower Subtenants, or otherwise diminish in any material respect the value of such Site. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if during the Term, within fifteen (15) Business Days after request by any Sprint Collocator, Lessee will notify the applicable Sprint Collocator whether there is any Available Space in respect of any Site. If any such Available Space then exists, the Sprint Collocator will have the Right of Substitution (for the benefit of itself or any of its Affiliates) as to such Available Space if, in the reasonable judgment of Lessee, such relocation will not (i) impair the structural integrity of the Tower (and in connection with any exercise of the Substitution Right Lessee may require the that the applicable Sprint Collocator perform such testing and analysis at the cost of the Sprint Collocator as would be customary in accordance with industry standard requirements in connection with such exercise) or cause interference in violation of Section 15 with the Communications Equipment of any Tower Subtenant or diminish the structural ability of the Tower to hold additional Tower Subtenants (it being acknowledged and agreed, however (but subject to clause (ii) immediately below), that the Sprint Collocator shall be entitled to use at all times the weight and wind loading equivalent of the Sprint Tower Envelope), or (ii) have the practical effect of limiting the number of potential Tower Subtenants at such Site (as compared prior to such Substitution or the rent payable by such Tower Subtenants), provided, that Lessee may prevent a Sprint Collocator from exercising its Right of Substitution if such exercise would cause a configuration of space that may reasonably be expected to limit Lessee's revenue at any particular Site, including avoiding having any so-called "orphan" space on a Tower (but with the assumption that no space on the Tower is more expensive to rent because of its location of the Tower). If the Sprint Collocator elects to exercise its Right of Substitution, then, upon completion of the relocation, at the Sprint Collocator's expense, of the Communications Equipment and Improvements of the Sprint Collocator or its Affiliate on the Site, the previously existing Sprint Collocation Space of the applicable Site will automatically be released by the Sprint Collocator or its Affiliate and become a part of the Available Space of such Site (and Sprint shall deliver such space in good condition, repair and order, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and shall remove all of Sprint's Communications Equipment therefrom and restore any damage thereto caused by, through or under any member of the Sprint Group), subject to the terms of this Agreement, and concurrently therewith, the Available Space on such Site to which the Communications Equipment and Improvements of Sprint or its Affiliate has been relocated (but in no event shall such space be larger than the Sprint Tower Envelope) will automatically become and constitute the Sprint Collocation Space (provided, however, that if the Sprint Collocator will maintain Communications Equipment of less than the equivalent weight and wind loading of nine (9) 1'x 6' panel antennas on the Tower at such Site as of the effective date of such relocation, the Sprint Collocation Space will contain an additional portion of such Tower so that the Sprint Collocation Space will contain the entire amount of the Sprint Tower Envelope to the extent there is adequate contiguous space available on the Tower as of the effective date of such relocation) subject to Section 6; provided, however, that the weight and wind loading criteria for such Sprint Collocation Space shall continue to be the same as existed prior to the exercise of the Right of Substitution. The Parties will at the Sprint Collocator's sole cost and expense promptly execute such instruments as may be reasonably required to further evidence such Substitution, including without limitation an amendment to Exhibit A or the applicable Site 56
Designation Supplement. The Sprint Collocator will, at its cost and expense, complete the relocation of its Communications Equipment. SECTION 26. Assignment and Subletting. (a) Without the prior written consent of Sprint, Lessee may not assign this Agreement or any of Lessee's rights under this Agreement in whole or in part, or sublease or grant concessions or licenses or other rights for the occupancy or use of all or any portion of any Site; provided, that, subject to any required consent of any Ground Lessor but without the consent of Sprint, (i) Lessee may lease, sublease, license or otherwise make available Available Space to Tower Tenants for the purpose of the installation, operation and maintenance of Communications Equipment as contemplated by, and subject to the applicable terms and provisions of, this Agreement (and in such event Lessee will not be released from, and will remain fully and completely liable for, payment and performance of all of its duties, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement); (ii) Lessee may (A) assign this Agreement in whole or in part to any Qualifying Lessee Transferee or (B) assign all or any portion of its rights with respect to a Site to an Affiliate of Lessee or (C) enter into the Severed Leases as contemplated by Section 41; provided that in the case of the transactions described in clauses (A) and (B) immediately above the assignee of Lessee must assume and agree to perform all of Lessee's obligations hereunder to the extent of such assignment. In the case of an assignment of this Agreement in connection with any transaction described in clause (B) above (other than an assignment to a GSI Financing Subsidiary in which case pursuant to Section 41(d), from and after execution of a Severance Lease, Lessee shall be released from all obligations with respect to the Sites that are leased or pre-leased under such Severance Lease), Lessee will not be released from, and will remain fully and completely liable for payment and performance of, all its duties, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement. Upon any assignment permitted above to a Qualifying Lessee Transferee, the obligations of Lessee under this Agreement with respect to the Sites that are the subject of the assignment will cease and terminate to the extent of such assignment, and Lessor and Sprint will look only and solely to the Person that is the Qualifying Lessee Transferee of Lessee's interest under this Agreement as to such Sites for performance of all of Lessee's duties and obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Sites from and after the date of the assignment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may enter into Mortgages in favor of any Lessee Lender, in which case the Lessee Lender with respect thereto will have the right to exercise remedies under any such Mortgage in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and any other agreement between Lessee and Sprint made in connection with this transaction. (b) Except as expressly permitted under this Section 26(b), no Sprint Collocator may assign sell, convey, transfer, sublease or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any of its rights under this Agreement in whole or in part, or sublease or grant concessions or licenses or other rights for the occupancy or use of all or any portion of any Site without the consent of Lessee. All of the Sprint Collocators, only in the aggregate, may sell, convey, transfer, assign, sublease, or otherwise dispose of their interests in the Sprint Collocation Space as a whole, not in part, without the consent of Lessee, to a successor Person by way of merger, consolidation, or other reorganization or to any Person acquiring substantially all of the assets of all of the Sprint Collocators and which Person is a wireless communications end user who intends to use substantially all of the Sprint Collocation Space for its own wireless communications business. 57
In addition, each Sprint Collocator will have the unrestricted right during the Term to sell, convey, transfer, assign, sublease or otherwise dispose of such Sprint Collocator's interest in and to the Sprint Collocation Space at any Site, in whole or in part, without the consent of Lessee to (i) any Affiliate, or (ii) such Person who is (A) not, and none of whose Affiliates are, a Lessee Competitor, and (B) is a wireless communication end user in any geographic market in which such Sprint Collocator has ceased to operate or will cease to operate after the consummation of transaction that is the subject of the assignment and subletting (collectively, a "Sprint Market Assignee"), who intends to use such Site solely for its own wireless communications business, provided that such Sprint Market Assignee enters into a master collocation agreement with Lessee, in the form of the then most recent master collocations agreement between Lessee (or its Affiliates) and the Sprint Market Assignee (or its Affiliates), or if none exists, in the form of the most recent master collocation agreement between Global Parent (or its Affiliates) and Sprint, or if none exists, a then market standard collocation agreement, except that the term and Withdrawal Rights of the Sprint Market Assignee shall reflect the term and Withdrawal Rights then applicable to the Sites that are the subject of such assignment (and the rent shall be described in the next following sentence), and the Sprint Market Assignee shall have no further rights hereunder and, upon such assignment, the applicable Sprint Collocator shall vacate such Site, and upon vacating such Site and removing the Sprint Communications Equipment from same and restoring the Sprint Collocation Space to the condition required by this Agreement, such Sprint Collocator shall be relieved of its obligations to pay the Sprint Collocation Charge with respect to such Site (each such transaction described in the foregoing provisions of this Section 26(b) being a "Sprint Transfer"). If, pursuant to any assignment, sublease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition permitted by this Agreement to a Sprint Market Assignee, a Sprint Collocator is no longer the tenant of Sprint Collocation Space, the applicable Sprint Collocation Charge payable shall be an amount equal to the product of (x) the then current Sprint Collocation Charge and (y) 1.25 and the foregoing shall thereafter be subject to annual adjustment as provided for in Section 11(b). If any Sprint Collocator effects a Sprint Transfer, then, in the case of a Sprint Transfer to a Qualifying Sprint Transferee, the obligations of the Sprint Collocator or any other Party hereunder constituting Sprint under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Sprint Collocation Space that is the subject of the Sprint Transfer will cease and terminate, and Lessee will look only and solely to the Person that is the Qualifying Transferee of Sprint Collocator's interest in and to such portion of the Sprint Collocation Space for performance of all of the duties and obligations of the Sprint Collocator or any other Party hereunder constituting Sprint under this Agreement with respect to such Sprint Collocation Space from and after the date of the Sprint Transfer. Otherwise, in the event of any Sprint Transfer, the applicable Sprint Collocator shall remain liable under this Agreement for the performance of such Sprint Collocator's duties and obligations hereunder as to such applicable Sprint Collocation Space that is the subject of the Sprint Transfer. (c) Subject to Section 26 and Section 36, neither Lessor nor any Sprint Contributor shall, or shall permit any Affiliate thereof to sell, convey, transfer, assign, sublease, encumber, mortgage or otherwise hypothecate or dispose of its interest in and to any Site, or grant concessions or licenses or other rights for the occupancy or use of all or any portion of any Site, during the Term. 58
(d) Each Party hereby agrees that any attempt of any Party to assign its interest in this Agreement or any of its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, in violation of this Section 26 will constitute a default under this Agreement and will be null and void ab initio. SECTION 27. Estoppel Certificate. Each Party, from time to time upon thirty (30) days' prior request by any other Party, will execute, acknowledge and deliver to the requesting Party, or to a Person designated by such requesting Party, a certificate stating that this Agreement is unmodified and in full effect (or, if there have been modifications, that this Agreement is in full effect as modified, and setting forth such modifications) and the dates to which Rent, Pre-Lease Rent, Sprint Collocation Charges and other sums payable under this Agreement have been paid, and either stating that to the knowledge of the signer of such certificate no default exists under this Agreement or specifying each such default of which the signer has knowledge. The requesting Party, at such Party's cost and expense, will cause such certificate to be prepared for execution by the requested Party. Any such certificate may be relied upon by any prospective Mortgagee or purchaser of any portion of a Site. SECTION 28. Holding Over. (a) If Lessee remains in possession of the Leased Property of any Master Lease Site after expiration or termination of the Term as to such Master Lease Site without any express written agreement by Lessor, then Lessee will be and become a tenant at sufferance, and there will be no renewal or extension of the Term as to such Master Lease Site by operation of Law. (b) If during the Term of this Agreement any Sprint Collocator remains in possession of the Sprint Collocation Space of any Site after expiration or termination of the Sprint Collocator's leaseback of or other right to use and occupy the Sprint Collocation Space at such Site without any express written agreement by Lessee, then such Sprint Collocator will be a month-to-month tenant with the monthly Sprint Collocation Charge equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the monthly Sprint Collocation Charge last applicable to the Sprint Collocation Space and subject to all of the other terms set forth in this Agreement, and there will be no renewal or extension of this Agreement as to the lease of the Sprint Collocation Space by operation of Law. SECTION 29. Rights of Entry and Inspection. (a) Lessor and the applicable Sprint Collocator and their respective representatives, agents and employees, at such Person's sole cost and expense, will be entitled to enter any portion of any Site at all reasonable times and with advance notice in accordance with and to the extent required under Section 6(a) for the purposes of inspecting such Site, making any repairs or replacements or performing any maintenance, and performing any work on the Site, to the extent required or permitted by this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 29 will imply or impose any duty or obligation upon Lessor or any Sprint Collocator to enter upon any Site at any time for any purpose, or to inspect any Site at any time, or to perform, or pay the cost of, any work which Lessee is required to perform under any provision of this Agreement, and neither Lessor nor any Sprint Collocator has any such duty or obligation. 59
(b) Each Sprint Collocator will permit Lessee and Lessee's representatives to inspect Sprint's Communications Equipment located on the Tower in accordance with industry standard practices to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Except in the event of an Emergency only, and only for the purposed of making repairs or replacements to address such Emergency, Lessee shall not be entitled to have access to or inspect any other of Sprint's Communications Equipment. Nothing in this Section 29 will imply or impose any duty or obligation upon Lessee to enter upon any Site at any time for any purpose, or to inspect the Leased Property at any time, or to perform, or pay the cost of, any work which Sprint is required to perform under any provision of this Agreement, and Lessee has no such duty or obligation. The Sprint Collocators agree to indemnify and hold the Lessee Indemnitees harmless from and against and in respect of any and all Claims, paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by any Lessee Indemnitee and in any manner arising out of, by reason of, or in connection with any entry onto any Site by Sprint or any of its Affiliates, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, engineers, agents, advisors, consultants or representatives. SECTION 30. Right to Act for Lessee. (a) In addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy Lessor or any Sprint Collocator may have under this Agreement, if Lessee fails to make any payment or to take any other action (or to cause any Tower Subtenant to take any action) when and as required under this Agreement, subject to the following sentence, Lessor or the applicable Sprint Collocator may, without demand upon Lessee and without waiving or releasing Lessee from any duty, obligation or liability under this Agreement, make any such payment or take any such other action required of Lessee. Unless Lessee's failure results in or relates to an Emergency, Lessor or the Sprint Collocator, as applicable, will give Lessee at least ten (10) days prior written notice of Lessor's or the Sprint Collocator's intended action and Lessee will have the right to cure such failure within such ten (10) day period unless the same is not able to be remedied in such ten (10) day period, in which event such ten (10) day period will be extended, provided Lessee has commenced such cure within such ten (10) day period and continuously prosecutes the performance of the same to completion with due diligence. No notice will be required in the event of an Emergency. The actions which Lessor or the Sprint Collocator may take will include, but are not limited to, the performance of maintenance or repairs and the making of replacements to the Towers and Improvements on each Site (and Lessor or the Sprint Collocator, as applicable, will have full access to the Sites for such purpose), the payment of insurance premiums which Lessee is required to pay under this Agreement, the payment of Ground Rent which Lessee is required to pay under the Ground Leases and the payment of Taxes which Lessee is required to pay under this Agreement. Lessor or the Sprint Collocator may pay all incidental costs and expenses incurred in exercising its rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, penalties, re-instatement fees, late charges, and interest. An amount equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the total amount of the costs and expenses (including salaries and benefits of employees) incurred by Lessor or the Sprint Collocator in accordance with this Section 30 is referred to as the "Reimbursable Maintenance Expenses", and will be due and payable by Lessee upon demand and bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date five (5) days after demand until paid by Lessee. (b) For purposes of this Section 30, the term "Emergency" means any event that causes, has caused or is likely to cause: (i) any bodily injury, personal injury or property damage; 60
(ii) the immediate suspension, revocation, termination or any other adverse effect as to any licenses and/or permits; or (iii) any material adverse effect on the ability of any Sprint Collocator or its Affiliates, or any Tower Subtenants, to operate Communications Equipment; or (iv) any failure of any Site to comply in any material respect with applicable FCC or FAA regulations or other licensing requirements. SECTION 31. Defaults and Remedies.

Any termination by Lessee of a Sprint Collocator's rights with respect to any or all Sites pursuant to this Section 31(b) shall not diminish or limit any obligation of the Sprint Collocator to pay the Sprint Collocation Charge provided for herein or any other amounts with respect to such Site(s). 62
(c) The following events constitute events of default by a Sprint Collocator: (i) if the Sprint Collocators fail to timely pay any portion of the Sprint Collocation Charge, and any such failure continues for ten (10) days after written notice from Lessee (it being understood the aggregate Sprint Collocation Charge is a single non-severable payment with respect to all of the Sites); (ii) if any Sprint Collocator fails to timely pay any other amount payable under hereunder not constituting a portion of the Sprint Collocation Charge, and such failure continues for ten (10) days after written notice from Lessee; (iii) if any Sprint Collocator violates or breaches, or fails to observe, keep, satisfy, perform and comply with, any material agreement, term, covenant, condition, requirement, restriction or provision of this Agreement in respect of any Site, and (x) such Sprint Collocator does not cure such violation, breach or failure within thirty (30) days after Lessee gives such Sprint Collocator written notice of such violation, breach or failure, or (y) such violation, breach or failure (which is not a failure to pay money) is incapable of being cured within thirty (30) days, and such Sprint Collocator does not commence to cure such violation, breach or failure within such thirty (30) day period and continuously prosecute the performance of the same to completion with due diligence; (iv) if any Sprint Collocator becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or if any action is brought by such Sprint Collocator seeking its dissolution or liquidation of its assets or seeking the appointment of a trustee, interim trustee, receiver or other custodian for any of its property; or if such Sprint Collocator commences a voluntary proceeding under the Federal Bankruptcy Code; or if any action or petition is otherwise brought by such Sprint Collocator seeking similar relief or alleging that it is insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature; or if any action is brought against such Sprint Collocator seeking its dissolution or liquidation of any of its assets, or seeking the appointment of a trustee, interim trustee, receiver or other custodian for any of its property, and any such action is consented to or acquiesced in by such Sprint Collocator or is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after the date upon which it was instituted; or if any proceeding under the Federal Bankruptcy Code is instituted against such Sprint Collocator and (A) an order for relief is entered in such proceeding, or (B) such proceeding is consented to or acquiesced in by such Sprint Collocator or is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after the date upon which it was instituted; or if any action or petition is otherwise brought against such Sprint Collocator seeking similar relief or alleging that it is insolvent, unable to pay its debts as they mature or generally not paying its debts as they become due, and such action or petition is consented to or acquiesced in by such Sprint Collocator or is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after the date upon which it was brought; or (v) If the Sprint Collocator rejects its rights to sublease or right to use any Site under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Sprint Collocators disputes that they are in default hereunder, and a Sprint Collocator is determined to be in default pursuant to Section 31(h), if the Sprint Collocators, within twenty (20) days following a determination that they are in default under Section 31(h), commences cure of such default and diligently completes same, an event of default with respect to the Sprint Collocators shall not be deemed to have occurred.

Upon (i) the occurrence of events of default not cured during the applicable time period for curing same (whether of the same or different types), by Lessee under Section 31(e) in respect of more than twenty percent (20%) of the Sites, in the aggregate, during any consecutive five (5) year period, which (A) results in material harm to the 65

Such arbitration proceedings will be initiated with three Qualified Arbitrators, with one selected by each of Lessor and Lessee and the third mutually selected by the Parties, each Party acting reasonably, and if the Parties cannot agree the third arbitrator shall, selected by the two other arbitrators. The arbitration will be held in Chicago, Illinois or such other location as is mutually agreeable to the Parties. All arbitrations will be governed by the applicable commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") for accelerated arbitration proceedings. The arbitrators will prepare in writing, and provide to the Parties, such arbitrators' determination, including factual findings and the reasons on which the determination was based. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators will be final, binding and conclusive and will not be subject to review or appeal and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the Parties. During the Decision Period and thereafter, if a Party elects to initiate arbitration proceeding under this Section 31(h), until the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings and the rendering of the decision of the arbitrators, any right or remedy provided under this Agreement to the Party alleging the default or termination right may not be exercised. "Qualified Arbitrator" shall mean a person with at least ten years experience in the commercial real estate business, including experience with cellular tower assets. (i) A Party's pursuit of any one or more of the remedies provided in this Agreement will not constitute an election of remedies excluding the election of another remedy or other 66
remedies, or a forfeiture or waiver of any amounts payable under this Agreement as to the applicable Site by such Party or waiver of any relief or damages or other sums accruing to such Party by reason of the other Party's failure to fully and completely keep, observe, perform, satisfy and comply with all of the agreements, terms, covenants, conditions, requirements, provisions and restrictions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Party will be liable to the other Party for indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits, however arising, even if a Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. (j) Either Party's forbearance in pursuing or exercising one or more of its remedies will not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any event of default or of any remedy. No waiver by either Party of any right or remedy on one occasion will be construed as a waiver of that right or remedy on any subsequent occasion or as a waiver of any other right or remedy then or thereafter existing. No failure of either Party to pursue or exercise any of its powers, rights or remedies or to insist upon strict and exact compliance by the other Party with any agreement, term, covenant, condition, requirement, provision or restriction of this Agreement, and no custom or practice at variance with the terms of this Agreement, will constitute a waiver by either Party of the right to demand strict and exact compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provide herein, any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 31(b), 31(d) or 31(f), or partial termination of a Parties' rights hereunder, shall not terminate or diminish any Parties' rights with respect to the obligations that were to be performed on or before the date of such termination. SECTION 32. Quiet Enjoyment. Lessee will, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Leased Property of each Master Lease Site and shall have the right provided herein to operate each Pre-Lease Site during the Term thereof without hindrance or interruption from Lessor, any Party comprising Sprint or any other Sprint Group Member. SECTION 33. No Merger. There will be no merger of this Agreement or any subleasehold interest or estate created by this Agreement in any Site with any superior estate held by a Party by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or indirectly, both the subleasehold interest or estate created by this Agreement in any Site and such superior estate; and this Agreement will not be terminated, in whole or as to any Site, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Without limiting generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section 33, there will be no merger of the subleasehold interest or estate created by this Agreement in Lessee in any Site with any with any underlying fee interest that Lessee may acquire in any Site that is superior or prior to such subleasehold interest or estate created by this Agreement in Lessee. SECTION 34. Broker and Commission. (a) All negotiations in connection with this Agreement have been conducted by and between Lessor, Lessee and Sprint without the intervention of any Person or other party as agent or broker other than Banc of America Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

"Financial Advisors"), which are advising Sprint Parent in connection with this Agreement and related transactions. (b) Each of Lessor, Lessee and Sprint warrants and represents to the other that there are no broker's commissions or fees payable by it in connection with this Agreement by reason of its respective dealings, negotiations or communications other than the advisor's fee payable to the Financial Advisors which will be payable by Sprint Parent. Lessor, Lessee and Sprint will, and do hereby indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other from and against the Claims of any and all brokers, agents and other intermediaries alleging a commission, fee or other payment to be owing by reason of their respective dealings, negotiations or communications in connection with this Agreement.

(a) Subject to the applicable provisions of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease, for each Master Lease Site, upon the execution of this Agreement or after any Conversion Closing, Lessee may, at its cost and expense, cause a memorandum of agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C to be filed in the appropriate County property records (unless the Ground Lease for any applicable Master Lease Site prohibits such recording) to provide constructive notice to third parties of existence of this Agreement. In addition, Lessee may, at its cost and expense, promptly following the execution of each Site Designation Supplement, cause such Site Designation Supplement with respect to the applicable Master Lease Site to be filed in the appropriate County property records unless the Ground Lease for the applicable Site prohibits such recording. The costs of recording the Site Designation Supplements shall be paid as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease. (b) In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties will have the right to review and make corrections, if necessary, to any and all exhibits to this Agreement or to the Site Designation Supplements. After making such corrections, Lessee will re-record such Site Designation Supplement to reflect such corrections, if requested by any Party, at the expense of the requesting Party. The Parties will cooperate with each other to cause changes to be made in the Site Designation Supplement for such Site, if such changes are requested by either Party to evidence any permitted changes in the description of the Sprint Collocation Space respecting such Site, including, without limitation changes in the Sprint Collocator's antennas or other parts of its Communications Facility at such Site. In addition to, and not in limitation of the foregoing, either Party will have the right, at its sole expense, to cause any amendment to such Site Designation Supplement to be recorded, including without limitation, in connection with such changes. SECTION 36. Purchase Option. (a) Right to Purchase. If this Agreement will not have been earlier terminated, or an event of default by Lessee will not have occurred and be continuing at the date of option exercise or the date fixed for purchase (as such date is specified below), Lessee will have an option, exercisable no earlier than one (1) year and no later than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the Purchase Option Closing Date (the "Option Trigger Window") to elect to purchase the right, 68
title and interest of Lessor and any applicable Party comprising Sprint or any other Person holding an interest therein by, through or under Sprint or by acquisition thereof from Sprint from, on and after the Effective Date (collectively, the "Option Sellers") in all (but not less than all) of the Purchase Sites (excluding, in all cases, Excluded Purchase Sites, Sprint's Improvements and any Tower Subtenant's Improvements on such Site(s)) then subject to this Agreement for the net aggregate Option Purchase Price attributable to the Purchase Sites (and on the other terms and subject to the conditions specified in this Agreement). Lessee may exercise such purchase option by submitting to the Option Sellers in writing an offer for all of the Purchase Sites within the Option Trigger Window. The Option Sellers will be obligated to sell, and Lessee will be obligated to buy, all such Master Lease Sites at a closing to be effective as of the Purchase Option Closing Date. Except as provided in this Section 36, Lessee will have no right or option to purchase any Sites subject to this Agreement. The Sprint Collocators acknowledge on their own behalf and on behalf of all Persons acquiring an interest in any Site (except for a Sprint Market Assignee who signs a separate collocation agreement with Lessee) that their rights in and to the Sites are subject to the provisions of this Section 36. (b) Payment of the Option Purchase Price. Lessee will pay to the Option Sellers the net aggregate Option Purchase Price for the Purchase Sites in cash or immediately available funds on or prior to the closing of such sale. At the closing of such sale, each of the Option Sellers will transfer or cause to be transferred its applicable Purchase Sites, at Lessee's expense, to Lessee and the Term as to the Purchase Sites will end. Risk of loss for the Purchase Sites purchased pursuant to this Section 36 will pass from the Option Sellers to Lessee upon payment of the applicable purchase price by Lessee to the Option Sellers. (c) Transfer by Lessor. Any transfer of Purchase Sites by the Option Sellers to Lessee pursuant to this Section 36 will include: (i) an assignment of each Option Seller's interest in any Ground Lease for such Purchase Site (which shall contain an assumption by Lessee of all of the obligations of such Option Seller under such Ground Lease and an agreement by Lessee to indemnify such Option Seller and each other Sprint Indemnitee from claims, losses or damages related to such obligations), a transfer of fee simple title to the Land for any Purchase Site which is an Owned Purchase Site, a transfer of each such Option Seller' interest in the applicable Tower and related assets (other than Sprint's Improvements or Sprint's Communications Equipment) and all appurtenances thereto; provided, that for so long as the Ground Lease, as amended, modified, or extended, is still in effect for any Purchase Site, each applicable Sprint Collocator will be entitled to lease the Sprint Collocation Space on each such Purchase Site from Lessee for successive five (5) year terms at rental rate equal to the then-current market rental rates for comparable locations; provided, that the Sprint Collocation Charge will thereafter be subject to increase on an annual basis at the beginning of each five (5) year term in an amount equal to the CPI Change; provided, if Lessee and any such Sprint Collocator fail to agree on a rental rate for one or more of the Purchase Sites, such rental rate will be determined for each applicable Purchase Site by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to such Sprint Collocator and Lessee. The cost of the determination of the rental rate will be shared equally by such Sprint Collocator and Lessee. The applicable Sprint Collocator will have the right to elect to terminate any such lease with respect to a Purchase Site as 69

(d) Evidence of Transfer. Each of the Option Sellers and Lessee will enter into assignments, deeds (with warranties of title as to such Option Sellers' actions only), bills of sale and such other documents and instruments as the other may reasonably request to evidence any transfer of such Purchase Sites. (e) Transfer Taxes. As provided in Section 16(d), any Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transfer of Purchase Sites by the Option Sellers to Lessee pursuant to this Section 36 will be divided equally between Lessor and Lessee. (f) No Warranties. Any transfer of a Purchase Site by any Option Seller to Lessee pursuant to this Agreement will be "AS IS" and without any warranty whatsoever by such Option Seller, except that in any transfer of a Purchase Site by any such Option Seller to Lessee pursuant to this Agreement, such Option Seller will warrant that the Option Seller has not previously transferred title to such Purchase Site that is so transferred and will convey the interest of such Option Seller with limited warranty stating that the Purchase Site is free of Liens or other matters created or arising by, through or under the Option Seller or any other Sprint Group Member from and after the Effective Date. SECTION 37. Net Lease. This Agreement, insofar as it relates to the lease or the use and operation by Lessee of any Site or the Leased Property on any Site is a net lease and, except as otherwise expressly provided in Sections 14, 20, 31 and 41 of this Agreement, will not terminate. Neither Lessee nor any Sprint Collocator will be entitled to any abatement, reduction, setoff, counterclaim, defense or deduction with respect to any Rent, Pre-Lease Rent, Sprint Collocation Charge, amount payable under Section 11(h) or other sum payable under this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Sections 14, 20, 31 and 41 of this Agreement, the obligation of Lessee and each Sprint Collocator under this Agreement will not be affected by reason of: (a) any damage to or destruction of any Site or any part of such Site by any cause whatsoever; (b) any condemnation of any Site; (c) any prohibition, limitation, restriction or prevention of Lessee's use or enjoyment of a Site by any Person; (d) any matter affecting title to any Site or any part of 70
such Site; (e) any loss of use or possession by Lessee of a Site or any portion of such Site, by reason of title paramount or otherwise; (f) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement or the impossibility or illegality of performance by Lessor or Lessee or both; (g) any action of any Governmental Authority; or (h) any other cause or occurrence whatsoever, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing. SECTION 38. Compliance with Specific FCC Regulations. (a) Lessee understands and acknowledges that Tower Subtenants are engaged in the business of operating Communications Equipment at each Site. The Communications Equipment is subject to the regulations of the FCC, including without limitation regulations regarding exposure by workers and members of the public to the radio frequency emissions generated by Sprint's Communications Equipment. Lessee acknowledges that such regulations prescribe the permissible exposure levels to emissions from the Communications Equipment which can generally be met by maintaining safe distances from such Communications Equipment. To the extent Lessee is required to do so under applicable FCC regulations, Lessee will install, or cause the Tower Subtenants to install, at its or their expense, such marking, signage or barriers to restrict access to any Site as Lessee deems necessary in order to comply with the applicable FCC regulations, with respect to Communications Equipment other than Sprint's Communications Equipment, and with respect to Sprint's Communications Equipment, the applicable Sprint Collocator will install same. To the extent Lessee is required to do so under applicable FCC regulations, Lessee further agrees to post, or to cause the Tower Subtenants to post, prominent signage at all points of entry to each Site containing instructions as to any potential risk of exposure and methods for minimizing such risk, with respect to Communications Equipment other than Sprint's Communications Equipment, and with respect to Sprint's Communications Equipment the applicable Sprint Collocator will install same. Lessee will cooperate in good faith with each Sprint Collocator to minimize any confusion or unnecessary duplication that could result in similar signage being posted with respect to any of Sprint's Communications Equipment at or near any Site in respect of any Sprint Collocation Space on such Site. (b) Lessee further agrees to alert all personnel working at or near each Site, including Lessee's maintenance and inspection personnel, to heed all of Lessee's or Tower Subtenant's signage or restrictions with respect to such Site, to maintain the prescribed distance from the Communications Equipment, and to otherwise follow the posted instructions. Lessee further agrees to give each Tower Subtenant at least ten (10) days' advance written notice of any repair or maintenance work to be performed on any Site which would require work in closer proximity to the Communications Equipment than prescribed by the signage or restrictions, to abide by any provisions in the Collocation Agreement related to such work and allow such work to be monitored by such Tower Subtenant, if required by such Tower Subtenant. (c) Lessor and Sprint cooperate with each Tower Subtenant on a going-forward basis with respect to each Site in order to help insure that such Tower Subtenant complies with the applicable FCC regulations. (d) Each Sprint Collocator acknowledges and agrees that Sprint's Communications Equipment at each Site is subject to the regulations of the FCC, including, without limitation, 71
regulations regarding exposure by workers and members of the public to the radio frequency emissions generated by Sprint's Communications Equipment and Sprint agrees to comply with all FCC Regulations and all other Applicable Laws. Each Sprint Collocator acknowledges that such regulations prescribe the permissible exposure levels to emissions from its Communications Equipment which can generally be met by maintaining safe distances from such Communications Equipment. Each Sprint Collocator will install at its expense such marking, signage, or barriers to restrict access to any of Sprint's Communications Equipment on a Site in respect of any Sprint Collocation Space on such Site as such Sprint Collocator deems necessary in order to comply with the applicable FCC regulations. Each Sprint Collocator will cooperate in good faith with Lessee to minimize any confusion or unnecessary duplication that could result in similar signage being posted with respect to any of Sprint's Communications Equipment at or near any Site in respect of any Sprint Collocation Space on such Site. Each Sprint Collocator, at its option, may also install signage at any Site identifying Sprint's Communication Facility at such Site and providing for contact information in the case of emergency. (e) Each Sprint Collocator further agrees to alert all personnel working at or near each Site, including such Sprint Collocator's maintenance and inspection personnel, to maintain the prescribed distance from the Communications Equipment, and to otherwise follow the posted instructions of Lessee. SECTION 39. Tax Indemnities. (a) Income Tax Indemnity. (1) Tax Assumptions. In entering into this Agreement and related documents, the Sprint Group has made the following assumptions regarding the characterization of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement for federal income tax purposes (the "Tax Assumptions"): (i) for federal income tax purposes, this Agreement will be treated as a "true lease" with respect to all of the Leased Property, the members of the Sprint Group will be treated, directly or indirectly through one or more entities that are classified as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes, as the owners and sublessors of the Leased Property, and Lessee will be treated (or, if Lessee is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, the entity treated as the owner of Lessee for federal income tax purposes) as the lessee of the Leased Property; (ii) following the execution of this Agreement, the Sprint Group will be entitled to deduct, pursuant to Section 168(b) of the Code, depreciation deductions with respect to the Sprint Group's adjusted tax basis in the Leased Property using the same depreciation method(s) as in effect immediately before the execution of this Agreement ("Federal Depreciation Deductions"); (iii) prepaid Rent and Pre-Lease Rent with respect to each Site will be paid under a single lease subject to Section 467 of the Code and will be characterized in part as a loan under section 467 of the Code and Treasury Regulations issued under such 72
section and the Sprint Group will be entitled to deduct interest attributable thereto with respect to each Site as set forth in Exhibit H; (iv) the only amounts that any Sprint Group Member will be required to include in gross income with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related documents will be (A) Rent and Pre-Lease Rent as it accrues as rent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the application of Section 467 of the Code and Treasury Regulations issued under such section and as set forth in Exhibit H with respect to each Site; (B) any indemnity (including any gross up) pursuant to this Agreement; (C) any amounts paid or otherwise recognized pursuant to a voluntary sale or other disposition by any Sprint Group Member (other than a sale or disposition attributable to a default by Lessee and/or the exercise of remedies by Lessor or Sprint or its Affiliates under this Agreement) of any Leased Property, it being understood for these purposes that a sale or disposition that may be deemed to have occurred on the Effective Date is not a sale; (D) proceeds upon Lessee's exercise of the purchase option pursuant to Section 36 of this Agreement; (E) any costs and expenses of Lessor or Sprint (and any interest thereon) paid or reimbursed by Lessee pursuant to this Agreement; (F) income attributable to the reversion of Alterations made by Lessee to Lessor at the end of the Term; (G) amounts expressly identified as interest in the Agreement and payable to Lessor or any Sprint Group Member; (H) any other amount to the extent such item of income results in an equal and offsetting deduction; and (I) any income or gain from an acceleration of Rent or Pre-Lease Rent as a result of the expiration or termination of a ground lease with respect to a Site listed in paragraphs 9 through 15 of Section 4.5 of the Contributors Disclosure Letter (as defined in the Agreement to Lease and Sublease); and (v) the combined effective federal and net state income Tax rate applicable to each Sprint Group Member will be thirty-nine percent (39%) (the "Assumed Rate"), comprised of thirty-five percent (35%) for the assumed federal rate and four percent (4%) (which is net of federal income Tax benefits) for the assumed state rate. (2) Lessee's Representations and Covenants. Lessee hereby represents and covenants to each Sprint Group Member as follows: (i) Lessee, any Affiliate of Lessee, any assignee or sublessee of Lessee, and any user (other than Lessor or Sprint or its Affiliates) of any portion of the Leased Property will not claim depreciation deductions as the owner of any of the Leased Property for federal income Tax purposes during the Term (and thereafter unless Lessee purchases such property pursuant to Section 36 of this Agreement), with respect to such Leased Property or portion of such Leased Property, except with respect to Alterations financed by Lessee or such assignee, sublessee, or other user, nor will they take any other action in connection with filing a Tax return or otherwise which would be inconsistent with (i) the treatment of the Sprint Group Members as the direct or indirect owners and lessors of the Leased Property for federal income tax purposes, (ii) the Tax Assumptions, or (iii) Section 11 and Exhibit H of this Agreement. (ii) none of the Leased Property will constitute "tax-exempt use property" as defined in Section 168(h) of the Code other than solely as a result of use by Lessor, 73
Sprint or its Affiliates and any other Person that is a Tower Subtenant as of the date of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease; (iii) on the Effective Date, no Alterations to any of the Leased Property will be required in order to render any of the Leased Property complete for its intended use by Lessee except for ancillary Severable Alterations that are customarily selected and furnished by lessees of property similar in nature to the Leased Property; (iv) Lessee has no current plan or intention of making any Alteration or repair with respect to any of the Leased Property that would not be treated as severable improvements or permitted nonseverable improvements within the meaning of Revenue Procedure 2001-28, 2001-1 C.B. 1156; (v) Lessee has no current plan or intention of making any Alteration or repair with respect to any of the Leased Property the value of which as of the end of the Term with respect to such Leased Property would compel Lessee to exercise any of the purchase options under Section 36 of this Agreement; and (vi) Lessee is not obligated to exercise any of the purchase options provided in Section 36 of this Agreement, it has not decided whether it will exercise any of the purchase options provided in Section 36 of this Agreement, and it has no plans to enter into or incur such obligation or to make such decision in the immediate future. (3) Indemnity for Tax Losses. (i) If, as a result of (A) the inaccuracy of any representation of Lessee, or the breach of any covenant of Lessee, set forth in Section 39(a)(2) of this Agreement; (B) any act of Lessee, or any assignee or sublessee of Lessee or any user of the Leased Property (other than Lessor or Sprint or its Affiliates) during the Term, other than (i) the execution or delivery of the Transaction Documents and (ii) any act required under the Transaction Documents or any Permitted Act; (C) the failure by Lessee to perform any act required of it under any of the Transaction Documents; (D) any disposition of Leased Property attributable to a default by Lessee and/or the exercise of remedies under this Agreement; or (E) the bankruptcy of Lessee. 74
any Sprint Group Member (each a "Tax Indemnitee") will not claim on the relevant income tax return based upon a written opinion from independent tax counsel reasonably acceptable to Lessee (setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and analysis upon which such opinion is based) that there is no reasonable basis as defined in Treas. Reg. ss.1.6662-3(b)(3) as in effect on the Effective Date for claiming all or any portion of the Federal Income Tax Benefits, will lose the right to claim all or any portion of the Federal Income Tax Benefits, will suffer a loss of, disallowance of, or delay in obtaining all or any portion of the Federal Income Tax Benefits, or will be required to recapture all or any portion of the Federal Income Tax Benefits, or any Tax Indemnitee will suffer an Inclusion (any such event being referred to as a "Tax Loss"), then, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written demand from or on behalf of the Tax Indemnitee describing in reasonable detail the Tax Loss and the computation of the amount payable (a "Tax Indemnity Notice"), Lessee will pay to such Tax Indemnitee as an indemnity the amount specified in the Tax Indemnity Notice. Subject to other adjustments required by this Section 39(a)(3)(i), such indemnity payment will be calculated in the Tax Indemnity Notice to equal, on an After-Tax Basis, the sum of (y) the amounts of any additional federal and state income taxes payable by such Tax Indemnitee for the taxable year (calculated at the Assumed Rate in the case of a Tax Loss respecting Federal Income Tax Benefits and calculated at the highest marginal applicable federal and state rates then in effect in the case of a Tax Loss respecting an Inclusion) and any interest thereon (calculated to the date such payment is made using the actual interest rates for underpayments of tax applicable to the relevant periods), plus (z) the amount of any penalties and additions to tax actually payable as a result of such Tax Loss and attributable thereto. The indemnity payment will be a net lump-sum amount, taking into account all past and anticipated future Tax Losses and Tax savings at the Assumed Rate, and using a discount rate equal to the Applicable Federal Rate (as defined in Code Section 1274(d)(1) then in effect) to present value future Tax Losses and Tax savings. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 39(a)(3)(i) will be made on an "After-Tax Basis" which means that any such payment will also include a "gross-up" for any federal or state income Taxes (determined at the highest marginal applicable federal and state rates then in effect) payable by such Tax Indemnitee with respect to the receipt or accrual of such indemnity payment, including such gross-up. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 39(a)(3)(i) to the contrary, Lessee will not be required to make any payment under this Section 39(a)(3)(i) earlier than, (a) in the case of a Tax Loss that is not being contested pursuant to Section 39(d) of this Agreement, the date such Tax Indemnitee (or the common parent of the consolidated group in which it is a member, as the case may be) files the applicable federal income Tax return, estimated or final as the case may be, which would first properly reflect the additional federal income Tax that would be due as a result of the Tax Loss and (b) in the case of a Tax Loss that is being contested pursuant to Section 39(d) of this Agreement, thirty (30) days after the date on which a Final Determination is made (or as otherwise provided in Section 39(d)) and (c) twenty (20) days after the receipt by Lessee of the Tax Indemnity Notice. (ii) Verification of Calculations. Lessee may timely request that any Tax Indemnity Notice be verified by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm or a lease advisory firm selected by Lessee and reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee. Such verification will be at Lessee's expense unless such accounting firm determines that the amount payable by Lessee is more than ten percent less than the amount shown on the Tax Indemnity Notice, in which event the Tax Indemnitee will pay such costs. In order to enable such independent accountants to verify such amounts, the Tax Indemnitee will 75
provide to such independent accountants (for their confidential use and not to be disclosed to Lessee or any other person) all information reasonably necessary for such verification. (4) Exceptions. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 39(a) to the contrary, Lessee will not be required to make any payment to any Tax Indemnitee in respect of any Tax Loss to the extent that any such Tax Loss occurs as a result of one or more of the following: (i) other than as a result of an Alteration by Lessee, the entry into a New Lease under Section 40 of this Agreement or any severance of this Agreement under Section 41, the determination that this Agreement is not a "true lease" for federal income tax purposes or that the members of the Sprint Group, directly or indirectly through one or more entities that are classified as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes, are not the owners or sublessors of the Leased Property, or that Section 467 of the Code does not apply to this Agreement in accordance with its terms; (ii) the voluntary sale, assignment, transfer, or other disposition or the involuntary sale, assignment, transfer, or other disposition attributable to the bankruptcy, insolvency or the breach of any covenant or obligation of the Tax Indemnitee set forth in the Transaction Documents of or by any such Tax Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, in either case, of any of the Leased Property or portion of such Leased Property by any such Tax Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates other than a sale, assignment, transfer, or disposition (A) contemplated by the Transaction Documents; (B) otherwise resulting from the exercise by any Sprint Group Member of its rights or performance of its obligations under the Transaction Documents; or (C) attributable to a default by Lessee and/or exercise of remedies under this Agreement; (iii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Tax Indemnitee; (iv) penalties, interest, or additions to Tax to the extent based upon issues unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related documents; (v) Lessee's exercise of the purchase option provided in Section 36 of this Agreement; (vi) the failure by the Sprint Group or any Sprint Group Member timely or properly to claim any Federal Income Tax Benefits or to exclude income on the appropriate Tax return other than in accordance with Section 39(a)(3) of this Agreement; (vii) any failure of the Tax Indemnitee to have taken all the actions, if any, required of it by Section 39(d) of this Agreement to contest the Loss and such failure materially prejudices the ability to contest, and Lessee has a reasonable basis for such contest (other than a failure attributable in whole or part to the failure of Lessee to follow the procedures set forth in Section 39(d) of this Agreement); (viii) any change in Law enacted, adopted or promulgated on or after the date of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease, provided that this exclusion shall not apply 76
to any (1) change in tax rates applicable to the making of any indemnity payment for a Tax Loss (a) respecting Federal Income Tax Benefits on an After-Tax basis or (b) respecting an Inclusion or (2) substitution or replacement of any Leased Property after a change in Law; (ix) the failure of the Sprint Group, or any single Sprint Group Member, to have sufficient income or Tax liability to benefit from the Federal Income Tax Benefits; (x) the inclusion of income by a Sprint Group Member as a result of the reversion of Alterations made by Lessee to Lessor at the end of the Term; (xi) a determination that Sprint is not holding the Leased Property in the ordinary course of a trade or business or that Sprint did not enter into the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents for profit; (xii) the existence of, or any consequence of, the prepayment of the Rent, or the application of Section 467 of the Code or the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, provided that the Lessee makes all payments when due and accrues all rental expense in accordance with the Allocated Rent as set forth in Exhibit H and provided further that this exclusion will not apply to the entry into a New Lease under Section 40 of this Agreement or any severance of this Agreement under Section 41; (xiii) any tax election by a Sprint Group Member that is inconsistent with the Tax Assumptions to the extent of a resulting increase in the Lessee's indemnity obligations hereunder; (xiv) a Tax Loss with respect to any period occurring after (and not simultaneously with) (1) the expiration or earlier termination of the Term with respect to a Site or (2) the return to Sprint of the Leased Property related to a Site, in either case other than interest, fines, penalties and additions to tax resulting from a Tax Loss that would not be excluded under this clause (xvi); (xv) the breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant by any Sprint Group Member in any of the Transaction Documents (except to the extent such breach or inaccuracy is attributed to a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant of Lessee or an Affiliate under the Transaction Documents). (b) General Tax Indemnity. (1) Lessee agrees to pay and to indemnify, protect, defend, save, and keep harmless each Sprint Group Member on an After-Tax Basis, from and against any and all Taxes upon or with respect to (A) any of the Leased Property, any portion of such Leased Property, or any interest therein (B) the acquisition, purchase, sale, financing, leasing, subleasing, ownership, maintenance, repair, redelivery, alteration, insuring, control, use, operation, delivery, possession, repossession, location, storage, refinancing, refund, transfer of title, registration, reregistration, transfer of registration, return, or other disposition of any of the Leased Property or any portion of such Leased Property, or interest in such Leased Property, (C) the rental payments, receipts, or earnings arising from the Leased Property, any portion of such Leased Property, or any interest 77
in such Leased Property, or payable pursuant to this Agreement, or any other payment or right to receive payment pursuant to any related document, or (D) any Alteration, removal, substitution, maintenance, or repair of any of the Leased Property (2) Exclusions from General Tax Indemnity. The provisions of Section 16 and Section 39(b)(1) will not apply to, and Lessee will have no responsibility under Section 16 and no liability under Section 39(b)(1) with respect to: (i) Taxes on any Sprint Group Member (other than such Taxes that are sales, use, rental, property, stamp, document filing, license, or ad valorem Taxes, or value added Taxes that are in the nature of or in lieu of such Taxes) imposed on any such member that are franchise Taxes, privilege Taxes, doing business Taxes, or Taxes imposed on, based on or measured by, gross or net income, receipts, capital, or net worth of any such member which are imposed by any state, local, or other taxing authority within the United States or by any foreign or international taxing authority; (ii) Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on any Sprint Group Member solely as a result of its activities in such jurisdiction unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related documents; (iii) Taxes on any Sprint Group Member that would not have been imposed but for the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any such member or an Affiliate of any Sprint Group Member or the inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant of such Tax Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates under the Transaction Documents (except to the extent such inaccuracy or breach is attributed to an inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Lessee or an Affiliate under the Transaction Documents); (iv) Taxes which are attributable to any period or circumstance occurring after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term with respect to a Site, except to the extent attributable to (I) a failure of Lessee or any of its transferees or sublessees or users of the Leased Property (other than Lessor or Sprint or its Affiliates) to fully discharge its obligations under this Agreement and related documents, (II) Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payments that are due after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term with respect to a Site and which are attributable to a period or circumstance occurring prior to or simultaneously with such expiration or earlier termination, (III) the entry into a New Lease under Section 40 of this Agreement; or (IV) any severance of this Agreement under Section 41; (v) any Tax that is being contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 39(d) during the pendency of such contest, but only for so long as such contest is continuing in accordance with Section 39(d) and payment is not otherwise required pursuant to Section 39(d); (vi) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee that would not have been imposed but for any act of such Tax Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof) that is expressly 78
prohibited, or omission of an act that is expressly required, as the case may be, by any Transaction Document; (vii) Taxes that would not have been imposed but for any voluntary sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, or other disposition or hypothecation or the involuntary sale, assignment, transfer, or other disposition attributable to the bankruptcy, insolvency or the breach of any covenant or obligation of the Tax Indemnitee set forth in the Transaction Documents of or by any such Tax Indemnitee, in either case, of any of the Leased Property or portion of such Leased Property by any such Tax Indemnitee other than a sale, assignment, transfer, or disposition (A) contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (B) otherwise resulting from the exercise by any Sprint Group Member of its rights or performance of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or (C) attributable to a default by Lessee and/or exercise of remedies under this Agreement; (viii) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee that would not have been imposed but for such Tax Indemnitee's (or Affiliate's) breach of its contest obligations under Section 39(d) (but only to the extent such breach materially prejudices the Lessee's ability to contest such Taxes or results in an increase in the amount of Lessee's indemnification obligation hereunder); (ix) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee in the nature of interest, penalties, fines and additions to Tax to the extent based upon issues unrelated to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents; (x) Taxes imposed on any Sprint Group Member that are United States federal, state or local net income Taxes of any such member; (xi) Taxes imposed in connection with or as a result of the leasing or use of the Sprint Collocation Space by Sprint or its Affiliates or the payment or accrual of the Sprint Collocation Charge; or (xii) Taxes to the extent that they are not the responsibility of Lessee as described in Section 16(a) without regard to this subsection. The provisions of this Section 39(b)(2) will not apply to any Taxes imposed in respect of the receipt or accrual of any payment made by Lessee on an After-Tax Basis. (3) Reports. If any report, return, certification, or statement is required to be filed with respect to any Tax that is the responsibility of Lessee under Section 16 or is subject to indemnification under this Section 39(b), Lessee will timely prepare and file the same to the extent permitted by law (except for (i) any report, return, or statement relating to any net income Taxes or, (ii) any report, return, or statement relating to any other Taxes not subject to indemnity under Section 39(b)(2)(i) or any Taxes in lieu of or enacted in substitution for any of the foregoing, except that, in such cases, Lessee will timely provide information necessary to file such report, return, or statement, (iii) any report, return, or statement relating to Property taxes or (iv) any other report, return, certification, or statement which any Sprint Group Member has notified Lessee that such member intends to prepare and file); provided, that any Sprint Group Member will have furnished Lessee, at Lessee's expense, with such information reasonably 79
necessary to prepare and file such returns as is within such member's control. Lessee will either file such report, return, certification, or statement and send a copy of such report, return, certification, or statement to the member, or, where not so permitted to file, will notify the member of such requirement within a reasonable period of time prior to the due date for filing (without regard to any applicable extensions) and prepare and deliver such report, return, certification, or statement to the member. In addition, within a reasonable time prior to the time such report, return, certification, or statement is to be filed, Lessee will, to the extent permitted by law, cause all billings of such Taxes to be made to each Sprint Group Member in care of Lessee, make such payment, and furnish written evidence of such payment. Lessee will furnish promptly upon written request such data, records and documents as any Sprint Group Member may reasonably require of Lessee to enable such member to comply with requirements of any taxing jurisdiction arising out of such member's participation in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related documents. (4) Payments. With the exception of Property Taxes, any Tax for which Lessee is responsible under Section 16 or any tax indemnified under this Section 39(b) will be paid by Lessee directly when due to the applicable taxing authority if direct payment is permitted, or will be reimbursed to the appropriate Sprint Group Member on demand if paid by such member in accordance herewith. Property Taxes will be paid in accordance with Sections 16(b) and (c). Except as explicitly provided in Section 16 or as otherwise provided in this Section 39(b), all amounts payable to a Sprint Group Member under Section 16 or this Section 39 will be paid promptly in immediately available funds, but in no event later than the later of (i) ten (10) business days after the date of such demand or (ii) two (2) Business Days before the date the Tax to which such amount payable relates is due or is to be paid and will be accompanied by a written statement describing in reasonable detail the Tax and the computation of the amount payable. Such written statement will, at Lessee's request, as long as payment is not delayed, be verified by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm selected by such member. Such verification will be at Lessee's expense unless the accounting firm determines that the amount payable by Lessee is more than ten percent less than the amount shown on such written statement, in which event, the applicable Sprint Group Member will pay such costs. In the case of a Tax subject to indemnification under this Section 39(b) which is properly subject to a contest in accordance with Section 39(d), Lessee (i) will be obligated to make any advances with respect to such Tax whenever required under Section 39(d) and (ii) will pay such Tax (in the amount finally determined to be owing in such contest) on an After-Tax Basis prior to the latest time permitted by the relevant taxing authority for timely payment after a final determination. (c) Tax Savings. If, by reason of any payment made, or events giving rise to such payment, to or for the account of any Tax Indemnitee by Lessee pursuant to Section 39(a) or 39(b), such Tax Indemnitee at any time realizes a reduction in any Taxes or receives a refund which was not taken into account previously in computing such payment by Lessee to or for the account of the Tax Indemnitee, then the Tax Indemnitee will pay to Lessee an amount equal to such actual reduction in Taxes or such refund (including interest received), plus the amount of any additional reduction in Taxes of the Tax Indemnitee attributable to the payment made by the Tax Indemnitee to Lessee pursuant to this sentence; provided, however, that (A) the Tax Indemnitee will not be obligated to make such payment with respect to any net Tax savings or refund to the extent that the amount of such payment would exceed the excess of (x) all prior indemnity payments (excluding costs and expenses incurred with respect to contests) made by 80
Lessee over (y) the amount of all prior payments by the Tax Indemnitee to Lessee; provided, that any such excess tax savings realized (or deemed realized) by such Tax Indemnitee which are not paid to Lessee as a result of this subclause (A) will be carried forward and reduce Lessee's obligations to make subsequent payments to such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to Section 39 of this Agreement; and (B) if any such Tax savings or refund realized by such the Tax Indemnitee, or any tax savings taken into account for purposes of determining "After-Tax Basis" will be lost or otherwise determined to be unavailable, such lost or otherwise unavailable Tax savings or refund will be treated as a Tax for which Lessee must indemnify the Tax Indemnitee pursuant to Section 39(a) or 39(b), as the case may be (without regard to the exceptions in Section 39(a)(4) and Section 39(b)(2) other than Section 39(a)(4)(iii), 39(a)(4)(iv), 39(b)(2)(iii) and 39(b)(2)(ix)). For purposes of this Section 39(c), each Tax Indemnity is assumed to be taxable at the Assumed Rate and an Inclusion is assumed to be taxable at the actual rate. (d) Contest Rights. In the event that any Tax Indemnitee receives any written notice of any potential claim or proposed adjustment against such Tax Indemnitee that would result in a Tax Loss or a Tax against which Lessee may be required to indemnify pursuant to Section 39(a) or 39(b) (a "Tax Claim"), such Tax Indemnitee will promptly notify Lessee of the claim and provide Lessee with information relevant to such claim; provided, that the failure by the Tax Indemnitee to provide any such information will not be treated as a failure to comply with this Section 39(d) unless the failure materially prejudices the conduct of such contest. With respect to Taxes indemnified under Section 39(b), Lessee will control the contest at Lessee's expense. With respect to Taxes indemnified under Section 39(a), the Tax Indemnitee will control the contest at Lessee's expense but will consult with Lessee in good faith, but Lessee may require the Tax Indemnitee to contest such Tax Claim at Lessee's expense and, in that event, the Tax Indemnitee will consult with Lessee in good faith, but the Tax Indemnitee will retain ultimate control over such contest. The Tax Indemnitee will not be obligated to contest any Tax Claim unless (i) in the case of a contest with respect to federal income Taxes, prior to taking the first such required action, Lessee will have furnished to the Tax Indemnitee an opinion of a nationally recognized, independent tax counsel chosen by Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Tax Indemnitee to the effect that there is a reasonable basis as defined in Treas. Reg. ss.1.6662-3(b)(3) as in effect (on the Effective Date) for the position to be asserted in contesting the matter in question, (ii) no event of default by Lessee under this Agreement will have occurred and be continuing, (iii) such contest does not involve a material risk to the Tax Indemnitee of sale, forfeiture, or loss of, or the creation of any lien on, any of the Leased Property or the imposition of criminal penalties and (iv) if Lessee reasonably requests, and the Tax Indemnitee elects to pursue, a contest that requires payment of the Tax as a condition to pursuing the contest, Lessee will loan, on an interest-free basis, sufficient funds to the Tax Indemnitee to pay the Tax and any interest or penalties due on the date of payment, and will fully indemnify the Tax Indemnitee for any adverse Tax consequences resulting from such advance. The Tax Indemnitee will not make, accept, or enter into a settlement or other compromise with respect to any Taxes indemnified pursuant to Section 39(a) or forego or terminate any such proceeding with respect to Taxes indemnified pursuant to this Section 39(b), without the prior written consent of Lessee, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Tax Indemnitee will not be required to appeal any adverse decision of the United States Tax Court, a Federal District Court, or any comparable trial court unless Lessee will have furnished to the Tax Indemnitee an opinion of a nationally recognized, independent tax counsel chosen by Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Tax 81
Indemnitee, to the effect that there is substantial authority for the position to be asserted in appealing the matter in question. (e) Tax Records. Lessor, Sprint and Lessee agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Sites (including, without limitation, access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for tax purposes. Lessor, Sprint and Lessee will retain all books and records with respect to Taxes indemnifiable under Section 39(b) or payable under Section 16 pertaining to the Sites for a period of at least seven (7) years following the close of the tax year to which the information relates, or sixty (60) days after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, whichever is later. At the end of such period, each Party will provide the other with at least sixty (60) days' prior written notice before destroying any such books and records, during which period the Party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of any books and records reasonably required by such Party for tax purposes. Lessor, Sprint and Lessee will cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Sites. (f) Survival. The agreements and indemnitees contained in this Section 39 shall survive the termination of this Agreement with respect to any Site. SECTION 40. Lessee Lender Protections. For any Lessee Lender, if Lessor is given written notice specifying the name and address of the Lessee Lender, or its servicing agent, and the applicable title of an officer or other responsible individual charged with processing notices of the type required under this Section 40, then the following provisions shall apply with respect to such Lessee Lender for so long as any Mortgage granted by Lessee to such Lessee Lender shall remain unsatisfied of record: (a) Modification, Termination or Surrender of Agreement. (i) The Lessee Lender shall not be bound by any modification or amendment of this Agreement in any respect so as to materially increase the liability of Lessee hereunder or materially increase the obligations or materially decrease the rights of Lessee without the prior written consent of the Lessee Lender, which consent shall no be unreasonably withheld. Further, this Agreement may not be surrendered or terminated other than in compliance with the provisions of this Section 40). Any such modification, amendment, surrender or termination not in accordance with the provisions of this Section 40 shall not be binding on any such Lessee Lender or any other Person who acquires title to its foreclosed interest. (ii) In addition, from time to time upon the request of a Lessee Lender (but not more than three (3) times in any one (1) year period (excluding the first year following the Effective Date), Lessor shall execute and deliver to such Lessee Lender an estoppel certificate in a form reasonably acceptable to Lessor and the Lessee Lender. (b) Notice and Cure Rights. 82
(i) Lessor, upon serving Lessee with any notice of default under the provisions of, or with respect to, this Agreement, shall also serve a copy of such notice upon the Lessee Lender (in the same manner as required by for notices to Lessee) at the address specified herein, or at such other address as a Lessee Lender shall designate in writing to Lessor. (ii) In the event of a default or breach by Lessee under this Agreement, the Lessee Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remedy such event, or cause the same to be remedied, within ten days (10) days after the expiration of all applicable grace or cure periods provided to Lessee in this Agreement, in the event of a monetary default or breach, or within sixty (60) days after the expiration of all applicable grace or cure periods provided to Lessee in this Agreement in the event of any other breach or default, and Lessor shall accept such performance by or at the instance of the Lessee Lender as if the same had been made by Lessee, provided, that if any such non-monetary default or breach that is capable of cure requires Lessee Lender to acquire possession of the Lessee's interest in the Sites that are the subject of such breach or default, such period will be extended for such reasonable period as may be required to obtain such possession and cure such default of breach; provided, however, during such extended period, Lessee Lender must continue to cure other defaults and breaches in accordance with the provisions of this Section 40(b)(ii). (iii) In the event of the termination of this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Term of this Agreement as provided herein for any reason (other than Lessee's failure to cure under (ii) above), including pursuant to Section 365 of the federal bankruptcy code, as amended from time to time, including any successor legislation thereto, or otherwise, Lessor shall serve upon Lessee Lender written notice that this Agreement has been terminated, together with a statement of any and all sums due under this Agreement and of all breaches and events of default under this Agreement, if any, then known to Lessor. Lessee Lender thereupon shall have the option, which option must be exercised by Lessee Lender's delivering notice to Lessor within then (10) Business Days after the Lessee Lender's receipt of notice from Lessor that the Lease has been terminated to cure any such Lessee breaches or Lessee events of default (and any Lessee breaches or Lessee events of default not susceptible of being cured by the Lessee Lender shall be deemed to have been waived) and the right to enter into a new lease (the "New Lease") (i) effective as of the date of termination of this Agreement, (ii) for the remainder of what otherwise would have been the Term of this Agreement but for such termination, (iii) at and upon all the agreements, terms, covenants, and conditions of this Agreement (with no Rent or Pre-Lease Rent payable thereunder), and (iv) including any applicable right to exercise the purchase option under Section 36 (collectively, the "New Lease Terms"). Upon the execution and delivery of a new lease under this Section 40, all Collocation Agreements and other agreements which theretofore may have been assigned to the Lessor (or reverted back to Lessor as a matter of law) thereupon shall be assigned and transferred, without recourse, representation or warranty, by Lessor to the lessee named in such new lease. (iv) Any notice or other communication which a Lessee Lender shall desire or is required to give to or serve upon Lessor shall be deemed to have been duly given or 83
served if sent to Lessor in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement at the address set forth herein. (c) Participation in Certain Proceedings and Decisions. Any Lessee Lender shall have the right to intervene and become a party, but only with respect to Lessee's involvement, in any Arbitration, litigation, condemnation or other proceeding affecting this Agreement to the extent of its security interest herein. Lessee's right to make any election or decision under this Agreement that is required or permitted to be made by Lessee with respect to the negotiation or acceptance of any Award or insurance settlement shall be subject to the prior written approval of such Lessee Lender. (d) No Merger. Without the written consent of each Lessee Lender, the leasehold interest created by this Agreement shall not merge with the fee interest in all or any portion of the Sites, notwithstanding that the fee interests and the leasehold interests are held at any time by the same Person. (e) Encumbrances on Personal Property and Subleases. Lessor hereby consents to Lessee's grant, if any, to any Lessee Lender of a security interest in the personal property owned by Lessee and located at the Sites and a collateral assignment of subleases of the interest of Lessee in all or any portion of the Sites and the rents, issues and profits therefrom, if any and a pledge of any equity interests in Lessee. Lessor agrees that any interest that Lessor may have in such personal property, whether granted pursuant to this Agreement or by statute, shall be subordinate to the interest of any Lessee Lender. (f) Notice of Default Under any Secured Lessee Loan. Lessee shall promptly deliver to Lessor a true and correct copy of any such notice of default, notice of acceleration or other notice regarding a default by Lessee under a Secured Lessee Loan after Lessee's receipt of the same. (g) Casualty and Condemnation Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of any casualty to or condemnation of any Site or any portion thereof during such time as any Secured Lessee Loan shall remain unsatisfied, the Lessee Lender shall be entitled to receive all insurance Proceeds and/or condemnation awards (up to the amount of the indebtedness secured by the Lessee Loan) otherwise payable to Lessee and apply same to restoration of the Leased Property in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (to the extent required by the terms of this Agreement); provided that if the Leased Property is not required to be restored pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Proceeds may be applied to the Secured Lessee Loan. Upon the Lessee Lender's request, the name of such Lessee Lender may be added to the "Loss Payable Endorsement" of any and all insurance policies required to be carried by Lessee hereunder. (h) Other. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Lessor shall not be obligated to provide the benefits and protections afforded to Lessee Lenders in this Section 40 to more than two (2) Lessee Lenders at any given time or (ii) in no event whatsoever will there be any subordination of the rights and interests of Lessor or of Sprint in and to the Sprint Collocation Space by virtue of any Mortgage granted by Lessee to any Lessee Lender and each Lessee Lender will, upon request, confirm such fact in writing. If there is more 84
than one Lessee Lender subject to the provisions of this Section 40, Lessor shall recognize the Lessee Lender exercising rights afforded by this Section 40 whose Secured Lessee Loan is most senior in lien (unless a Lessee Lender junior in lien requires that the holder thereof have a superior entitlement to such rights, and the other Lessee Lender senior in lien shall agree in writing to such request, in which event such recognition shall be of the holder of that Secured Lessee Loan), provided that such Lessee Lender shall have complied with the provisions of this Section 40; provided, however, that Lessor shall have no obligation to determine which Lessee Lender is indeed senior in lien and shall have no liability to either Lessee Lender for an erroneous determination, if Lessor attempts to make such a determination, so long as such determination is made in good faith based upon the evidence and information of lien priority provided to Lessor by the Lessee Lenders. Each Lessee Lender shall have the right to appear in any arbitration or other material proceedings arising under this Agreement and to participate in any and all hearings, trials and appeals in connection therewith, but only to the extent related to the rights or obligations of Lessee in the matter that is the subject of the arbitration or proceedings or to protect the security interest of Lessee in the Leased Property. (i) Recourse of Lessor. Lessor's recourse against any Lessee Lender shall be expressly limited to the Lessee Lender's interest in this Agreement and in the Sites and any and all real, personal and intangible property associated with the Sites (including without limitation, any revenues from any Collocation Agreements or any Proceeds or Awards). SECTION 41. Financeable Sites and Severed Leases. (a) Non-Financeable Sites. With respect to each Site that is not a Financeable Site on the Effective Date, Lessee will use commercially reasonable efforts to make each such Site a Financeable Site prior to the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date. In connection therewith, Lessee will take such actions and incur such costs, expenses and fees as are commercially reasonable in light of Lessee's financing structure. (b) Mutual Cooperation. In connection with Lessee's efforts under this Section 41(b), Lessor and the Sprint Contributors shall be actively involved with Lessee in all material aspects of the efforts to make all Sites Financeable Sites and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Lessee in such respect (but without obligation to pay any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or fees in respect thereof or related thereto). Lessee shall provide to Lessor and the Sprint Contributors information in reasonable detail from time to time with respect to the actions taken by Lessee pursuant to this Section 41, and Lessor and the Sprint Contributors shall have the right to request, which request shall be reasonably approved by Lessee, to directly contact the applicable Parties in an effort to cause any Site to become a Financeable Site; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate Lessor or the Sprint Contributors to expend any amounts in connection therewith and may not obligate Lessee to expend any amounts in connection therewith. (c) Failure of Sites to Be Financeable. (i) Within thirty (30) days following the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, Lessee will deliver to Lessor a written statement listing all the Sites that are not Financeable Sites (the "Preliminary Non-Financeable Sites Statement") together 85
with any Non-Financiable Site supporting documentation that Lessee deems relevant to be delivered therewith. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by Lessor of the Preliminary Non-Financeable Sites Statement, Lessor shall have the right to request Non-Financeable Site Supporting Documentation reasonably required by Lessor. Lessor will have thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Preliminary Non-Financeable Sites Statement and all Non-Financeable Site Supporting Documentation requested by Lessor in a timely manner as provided herein to notify Lessee of any objection with respect to the inclusion on such statement of a Site as not being a Financeable Site (and must state any such objection on a Site-by-Site basis, together with a reasonably detailed explanation of such objection). If Lessor does not so notify Lessee of any such objection to a specific Site not being a Financeable Site within such thirty (30) day period in accordance with this Section 41(c), the Preliminary Non-Financeable Sites Statement with respect to such Site will be deemed to be the final non-financeable sites statement (the "Final Non-Financeable Sites Statement"). All Sites on the Final Non-Financeable Site Statement shall be deemed to be "Non-Financeable Sites." (ii) Lessor and Lessee will cooperate in good faith for ten (10) Business Days to resolve any dispute relating to the Preliminary Non-Financeable Sites Statement. If the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute relating to the Preliminary Non-Financeable Sites Statement within such ten (10) Business Day period, the Parties will initiate arbitration proceedings in accordance with the provisions of Section 31(h) to seek final determination of which Sites are included on the Final Non-Financeable Site Statement. (iii) If the aggregate amount of the Non-Financeable Sites Financing Costs for all Non-Financeable Sites included on the Final Non-Financeable Sites Statement exceeds $10,000,000, the Sprint Contributors will pay to Lessee an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the positive excess of (A) the aggregate amount of the Non-Financeable Sites Financing Costs over (B) $10,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Lessee; provided, however, that the Sprint Contributors shall have no obligation to pay any such amount attributable to any matter for which any Lessee Indemnitee has received payment pursuant to a claim for indemnification under Article 9 of the Agreement to Lease and Sublease. (d) Severance of Agreement. In order for Lessee's Affiliates from time to time to cause the financing of Sites, Lessee shall have the right to cause the severance of this Agreement (or future Severance Leases) into multiple Severance Leases and have the "lessee's/operator's" right under such Severance Lease for the Severed Sites (as well as the "lessor's" right under the Sprint Collocation Agreement with respect to the Severed Sites) assumed by a GSI Financing Subsidiary, provided this Lease shall not be severed into more than three (3) Severance Leases in the aggregate. Each Severance Lease shall be substantially in the form of this Lease, with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that this Agreement has been severed. The Exhibits for such Severance Leases shall include the applicable information set forth in the Exhibits for this Agreement, solely with respect to the Severed Sites. Upon entering into each Severance Lease, the Parties shall also amend the exhibits to this Agreement to exclude each of the Severed Sites. Lessee shall also have the right to sever each of the Master Collocation Agreements with respect to the Severed Sites (and, if requested by Lessee, Sprint and its Affiliates shall assist 86
Lessee in effectuating same). The obligations of the "lessee" under each Severance Lease to Lessor and Sprint under each Severed Lease shall be separate and distinct from the obligations of the "lessee" under this Agreement and under each other Severed Lease, and this lease and the Severed Leases shall not be cross-defaulted with one another, and the obligations of Lessee and the lessees under each severance lease (and Global Parent under each Severed Lease) shall be separate and distinct from one another. If Lessee desires the other Parties to enter into a Severance Lease, Lessee shall send notice to Sprint informing such Parties of its desire to enter into a Severed Lease, specifying the applicable Sites and including with such notice an executable Severed Lease and amendment hereto, along with amended memoranda of leases or Site Designation Supplements with respect to the applicable Sites. Sprint shall upon receipt of same, review and reasonably cooperate with Lessee to effect the execution and delivery of any Severed Lease. Under each Severance Lease and this Lease, following execution of a Severance Lease the Global Parent Maximum Obligation hereunder and thereunder shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Ratable Global Parent Maximum Obligation hereunder and thereunder, and, if requested by Lessor, Global Parent will confirm such Ratable Global Parent Maximum Obligation in writing. "Ratable Global Parent Maximum Obligation" shall mean an amount equal to the product of (x) the Global Parent Maximum Obligation and (y) a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate sum of the Rent and the Pre-Lease Rent for the Sites remaining under this Lease or a Severance Lease, as applicable and the denominator of which is the aggregate sum of the Rent and the Pre-Lease Rent hereunder on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that for all tax purposes, including Section 467 of the Code, a Severance Lease shall be treated as a continuation of this Agreement with respect to the Severed Sites, no Severance Lease will contain any substantial modifications to this Agreement, and with respect to each Site, any Severance Lease and this Agreement will be treated as one lease agreement. (e) Severance of Indemnification Obligations. With respect to all indemnification obligations of Lessee hereunder (or of a GSI Financing Subsidiary under a Severed Lease), Lessee, at its election, may elect to have Global Parent provide such indemnities in lieu of Lessee (or the applicable GSI Financing Subsidiary), and in connection therewith execute an indemnity reasonably acceptable to Lessor and Sprint, and upon execution of same, Lessor will acknowledge that Lessee is relieved of all indemnification obligations hereunder. (f) Cooperation with Financing. Sprint and Lessor acknowledge that in connection with the financings of its interests in the Sites, from time to time, Lessee may require legal opinions (or updates thereof or reliance letters or similar items with respect thereto) from its counsel, at Lessee's expense, with respect to certain bankruptcy-related matters and in connection therewith Sprint and Lessor will cooperate in taking such actions as may be reasonably required to give such opinions as Lessee may reasonably request and to provide customary undertakings, representations and certificates (including without limitation, as corporate structure charts, certifications that the requirements of the LLC Agreement will be, and have at all times been, complied with), such cooperation and provision at Lessee's expense. SECTION 42. Global Parent Guaranty. (a) Global Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Sprint Indemnitees the full and timely payment and performance and observance of all of the terms, provisions, covenants and 87
obligations of Lessee under this Agreement (the "Lessee Obligations"). Global Parent agrees that if Lessee defaults at any time during the Term of this Agreement in the performance of any of the Lessee Obligations, Global Parent shall faithfully perform and fulfill all Lessee Obligations that involve payment of a fixed sum and shall pay to the applicable beneficiary all attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses, costs and disbursements incurred by the applicable beneficiary on account of any default by Lessee and on account of the enforcement of this guaranty. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (but subject to the provisions of Section 41(d)), the maximum aggregate amount payable hereunder by Global Parent shall be Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) (the "Global Parent Maximum Obligation") and following aggregate payment by Global Parent to the Sprint Indemnitees of such amount, Global Parent shall have no further obligations hereunder. (b) The foregoing guaranty obligation of Global Parent shall be enforceable by any Sprint Indemnitee in an action against Global Parent without the necessity of any suit, action, or proceedings by the applicable beneficiary of any kind or nature whatsoever against Lessee, without the necessity of any notice to Global Parent of Lessee's default or breach under this Agreement, and without the necessity of any other notice or demand to Global Parent to which Global Parent might otherwise be entitled, all of which notices Global Parent hereby expressly waives. Global Parent hereby agrees that the validity of this guaranty and the obligations of Global Parent hereunder shall not be terminated, affected, diminished, or impaired by reason of the assertion or the failure to assert by any Sprint Indemnitee against Lessee any of the rights or remedies reserved to such Sprint Indemnitee pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other remedy or right which such Sprint Indemnitee may have at law or in equity or otherwise. (c) Global Parent covenants and agrees that this guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing guaranty. The liability of Global Parent hereunder shall not be affected, modified, or diminished by reason of any assignment, renewal, modification or extension of this Agreement or any modification or waiver of or change in any of the covenants and terms of this Agreement by agreement of a Sprint Indemnitee and Lessee, or by any unilateral action of either a Sprint Indemnitee or Lessee, or by an extension of time that may be granted by a Sprint Indemnitee to Lessee or any indulgence of any kind granted to Lessee, or any dealings or transactions occurring between a Sprint Indemnitee and Lessee, including, without limitation, any adjustment, compromise, settlement, accord and satisfaction, or release, or any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangements, assignment for the benefit of creditors, receivership, or trusteeship affecting Lessee. Global Parent does hereby expressly waive any suretyship defense it may have by virtue of any statute, Law, or ordinance of any state or other Governmental Authority. (d) All of the Sprint Indemnitees' rights and remedies under this guaranty are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no such right and remedy herein is intended to be the exclusion of or a waiver of any other. Global Parent hereby waives presentment demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, protest notice of protest, notice of dishonor, and notice of acceptance. Global Parent further waives any right to require that an action be brought against Global or any other Person or to require that resort be had by a beneficiary to any security held by such beneficiary. SECTION 43. General Provisions. 88

(i) Specific Performance. Each Party recognizes and agrees that if any other Party should refuse to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, the remedy at Law would be inadequate and agrees that for breach of such provisions, each Party will, in addition to such other remedies as may be available to it at Law or in equity, be entitled to injunctive relief and to enforce its rights by an action for specific performance to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Each Party hereby waives any requirement for security or the posting of any bond or other surety in connection with any temporary or permanent award of injunctive, mandatory or other equitable relief.

(i) EACH PARTY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY COURT ACTION ARISING AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES, WHETHER UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER MADE BY CLAIM, COUNTER CLAIM, THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR OTHERWISE. If for any reason the jury waiver is held to be unenforceable, the Parties agree to binding arbitration for any dispute arising out of this Agreement or any claim arising under any federal, state or local statutes, Laws or regulations, under the applicable commercial rules of the AAA. Any arbitration will be held in the New York, New York metropolitan area and be subject to the Governing Law provision of this Agreement. Discovery in the arbitration will be governed by the Local Rules applicable in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
