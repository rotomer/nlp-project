NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), as follows: 1. All references in the Second Amended Agreement or any exhibit thereto to the term "Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement" shall mean the Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, as amended by this Amendment. 2. All references in the Second Amended Agreement or any exhibit thereto to the term "Agreement" shall mean the Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, as amended by this Amendment. 3. All references to Sprint Corporation in the Second Amended Agreement and all exhibits thereto shall be replaced with the new corporate name, Sprint Nextel Corporation. 4. Section 1(a) of the Second Amended Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following Section 1(a): (a) "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner of the Voting Securities of the Company then outstanding representing 15% or more of the Voting Power of the Company other than as a result of a Qualifying Offer, but shall not include (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii) any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, (iv) any Person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan; and (v) any Person that inadvertently has become the Beneficial Owner of Voting Securities of the Company then outstanding representing 15% or more of the Voting Power of the Company and within ten Business Days after the date upon which the Company first becomes aware of the occurrence of such an event, the Board of Directors in its sole 2
discretion (1) approves the beneficial ownership interest then held by such Person, or (2) provides such Person a thirty day period to divest a sufficient number of Voting Securities so as to decrease the beneficial ownership of such Person to less than 15% of the Voting Power of the Voting Securities then outstanding and such Person has so divested at the end of any such thirty day period.

The phrase "then outstanding," when used with reference to a Person's beneficial ownership of securities of the Company, shall mean the number of such securities then issued and outstanding together with the number of such securities not then actually issued and outstanding which such Person would be deemed to beneficially own hereunder. 5. Section 1(k) of the Second Amended Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following Section 1(k): (k) "Common Stock" (i) when used with reference to the Company, shall mean Series 1 Common Stock, and/or Series 2 Common Stock, and/or Non-Voting Common Stock, in each case as the context requires; and (ii) when used with reference to any Person other than the Company, shall mean the capital stock 3
of such Person with the greatest voting power, or the equity securities or other equity interest having power to control or direct the management, of such person. 6.
