Item 8.01 Other Events On July 15, 2005, iPCS Wireless, Inc. (the "iPCS Plaintiff"), a wholly owned subsidiary of iPCS, Inc., filed a complaint (the "Complaint") against Sprint Corporation, WirelessCo L.P., Sprint Spectrum L.P., SprintCom, Inc. and Sprint Communications Company L.P. (collectively, "Sprint") in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that following the consummation of the anticipated merger between Sprint Corporation and Nextel Communications, Inc. ("Nextel"), Sprint will breach its exclusivity obligations under the Management Agreement, dated as of January 22, 1999, as amended, between the iPCS Plaintiff and Sprint (the "Management Agreement"). The Complaint seeks (1) a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction enjoining Sprint and those acting in concert with it from engaging in certain post-merger conduct in the iPCS Plaintiff's service areas, including the operation of the Nextel network, marketing, sales and promotional activities relating to Nextel products, and disclosing confidential business information, in each case in a manner that would violate the Management Agreement and (2) a declaratory judgment that the post-merger operation of the Nextel network and other potential post-merger activity by Sprint will breach the Management Agreement. In addition, the iPCS Plaintiff has filed motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. The motion for a temporary restraining order seeks to temporarily restrain Sprint Corporation from closing the merger with Nextel to the extent that the merger requires or contemplates activity in the iPCS Plaintiff's exclusive service area that would breach the Management Agreement. The motion for a preliminary injunction seeks the issuance of a preliminary injunction, pending a trial on the merits, which would enjoin Sprint from engaging in certain post-merger conduct in the iPCS Plaintiff's service areas, including the operation of the Nextel network, marketing, sales and promotional activities relating to Nextel products, and disclosing confidential business information, in each case in a manner that would violate the Management Agreement. Prior to the filing of the Complaint, Sprint and the iPCS Plaintiff had discussed possible revisions to their commercial arrangements in light of the pending Sprint Nextel merger. Although Sprint has had and may from time to time continue to engage in discussions with the iPCS Plaintiff regarding these matters, there is no assurance as to the outcome of any such discussions. 1
