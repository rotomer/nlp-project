Item 8.01 Other Events
 
On July 18, 2005, Judge Thomas P. Quinn of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois denied a motion by iPCS Wireless, Inc. (the "iPCS Plaintiff"), a wholly owned subsidiary of iPCS, Inc., for a temporary restraining order enjoining the closing of the anticipated merger involving Sprint Corporation and Nextel Communications, Inc. ("Nextel").
 
Judge Quinn also issued an order temporarily restraining WirelessCo L.P., Sprint Spectrum L.P., SprintCom, Inc. and Sprint Communications Company L.P. (collectively, the "Sprint Entities") from sharing with Nextel certain confidential information as defined in the Management Agreement, dated as of January 22, 1999, as amended, between the iPCS Plaintiff and the Sprint Entities (the "Management Agreement"). Further submissions of evidence and hearings are scheduled with respect to the scope of the order, but Sprint does not expect that the obligations imposed by the order will expand the Sprint Entities' existing confidentiality obligations under the Management Agreement.
 
A further hearing before Judge Quinn on the iPCS Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order is scheduled for July 22, 2005.
 
The denial of the iPCS Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order against the Sprint Nextel merger and the other actions described in this report were taken in connection with the lawsuit more fully described by Sprint Corporation's current report on Form 8-K filed on July 18, 2005.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
