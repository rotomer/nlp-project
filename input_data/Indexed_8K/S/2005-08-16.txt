Exhibit 99.1 [SPRINT - TOGETHER WITH NEXTEL LOGO] News Release Sprint Nextel Corporation 2001 Edmund Halley Drive Reston, Va. 20191 Media Contact: Scott Stoffel, 913-794-3603 scott.e.stoffel@mail.sprint.com Investor Relations Contact: Kurt Fawkes, 913-794-1140 kurt.e.fawkes@mail.sprint.com SPRINT NEXTEL DECLARES THIRD QUARTER DIVIDENDS RESTON, Va. - August 15, 2005 - Sprint Nextel Corporation (NYSE: S) today announced that its board of directors has declared third quarter dividends for Sprint Nextel Common Stock. A dividend of 2.5 cents per share is payable Sept. 30, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Sept. 9, 2005. The quarterly cash dividend was adjusted - Sprint previously paid 12.5 cents per share to FON Common Stock shareholders on a quarterly basis - to reflect Sprint's merger with Nextel Communications Inc., and was set at a level consistent with the aggregate amount of dividends that Sprint Nextel's local telecommunications business is expected to pay its shareholders following the completion of its planned spin-off into a separate Fortune 400 company. Sprint Nextel will continue to evaluate its dividend policy in the context of its growth prospects and cash requirements. In anticipation of the upcoming filings with various state regulators relating to the spin-off, the Sprint Nextel board of directors has also announced plans with respect to the expected initial capital structure for the local business at the time of the spin-off, which is expected to be completed within nine to 12 months. The Sprint Nextel board expects that the local business will have approximately $7.25 billion of debt when the spin-off is completed. The expected annual cash dividend will be roughly $300 million. Sprint Nextel believes that this proposed capital structure and dividend policy will result in the local business having financial characteristics consistent with companies that have been rated "investment grade" by major ratings agencies.

The per share cash amount of merger consideration is based on the cash ratio of 0.03249782, multiplied by $26.0415, the average of the per share closing prices of shares of Sprint series 1 common stock during the 20 trading day period on the New York Stock Exchange ending on (and including) the closing date.
