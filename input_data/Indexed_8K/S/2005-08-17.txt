RESTON, Va. Aug. 17, 2005  Sprint Nextel Corporation (NYSE: S) announced today that it intends to pursue the appraisal process under the so-called "put" provisions of Nextel Partners' certificate of incorporation rather than pursuing a negotiated acquisition. Sprint Nextel added that it is filing a statement with the SEC outlining its views on what it sees as valuation and other issues arising under the complex and unusual put provisions.
 
Nextel Partners has said that a special committee of its board recommended that Partners' shareholders initiate the process spelled out in Partners' charter to put their shares to Sprint Nextel as a result of the Sprint Nextel merger that closed on Aug. 12. If the Nextel Partners shareholders initiate the put process, Nextel Partners' charter calls for each of Sprint Nextel and Nextel Partners to appoint an appraiser to determine the "fair market value" of Nextel Partners' stock, with a third appraiser to resolve the matter in the event that the first two appraisers' valuations are more than 10 percent apart. Sprint Nextel said that it believed that, once initiated, the appraisal process would take at least four months to complete, and possibly substantially longer given the uncertainties under the charter and the possibility of challenge.
 
Sprint Nextel added that there necessarily can be no assurance as to the outcome, timing or terms of the Nextel Partners' put process or any possible transaction, and reserved the right to take any action in the future that it determines to be in its best interests.

Valuation Principles
Important issues remain that could impact value to Nextel Partners shareholders
Some Wall Street analysts have assumed/concluded that "fair market value" necessarily equates to market plus takeover premium
But definition of "fair market value" is complex and there is uncertainty as to appraisal standards and process
Sprint Nextel believes that intrinsic value is the underlying standard in the put process
Sprint Nextel believes that no "willing buyer" would base its decision primarily on trading prices at a particular time
Sprint Nextel believes the relevant valuation methodologies arising from any consideration of "fair market value" should include discounted cash flow ("DCF"), comparable company and precedent transaction analyses
In Sprint Nextel's view, any valuation analysis (e.g., DCF) should take into account future operating risks to Partners arising from the changing competitive environment, including the advent of new, competing technologies and the evolution of roaming
6
 
Valuation Principles (cont'd)
Sprint Nextel believes that serious issues exist as to valuation
Sprint Nextel believes that DCF analysis already presumes the benefit of control over operations and cash flow, therefore an additional control premium over a DCF value is not appropriate (we believe that Delaware law is consistent with this view) Sprint Nextel also believes that transaction premiums are not a driver of valuation, but reflect an appropriate return on invested capital for the buyer, including synergies Sprint Nextel believes that premiums cannot be analyzed in isolation: they are a by-product of valuation analysis, which should reflect deal multiples, synergies and other factors
The Partners valuation process may take an extended period of time
Sprint Nextel believes that it is possible, if not likely, that the appraisal process will take at least four months after the put is exercised Sprint Nextel believes that the challenge process, if triggered, could continue for a substantial period of time, during which Partners shareholders' only right is to eventually receive an amount of consideration that will not be determined until the end of the challenge process There is no provision for compensation for the time-value-of-money absent unexcused delay in payment, and then only for periods after valuation is completed
7
 
Valuation Principles (cont'd)
Sprint Nextel believes that the transactions selected for the precedent transaction analysis should be relevant
Sprint Nextel believes that 7 of the 9 precedent change-of-control transactions cited in Partners' revised proxy are out-of-date and are not meaningful in today's circumstances

Sprint Nextel believes that the transactions from the 1999/2000 "bubble" period are not necessarily representative of what an appraiser should view as comparable Discussion of the two precedent transactions after the "bubble" burst does not refer to either multiples or potential synergies

Sprint Nextel Observations Regarding Certain Partners Positions
Operational Outlook and Stock Price
SPRINT NEXTEL VIEW OF PARTNERS POSITION
Partners said that its "share price performance takes into account the strong operating performance of [its] business over time" (a)
SPRINT NEXTEL OBSERVATIONS
Regardless of Partners' recent performance, we believe that speculation surrounding the put process makes its current stock price an unreliable data point given the need to consider "unaffected" market prices under Partners' charter
Partners said that "based on expected continuing strength of the wireless industry, [its] ability to continue to execute operationally, and assuming [it does not] experience undue interference in [its] operations from the Sprint/Nextel merger, [it remains] positive in [its] outlook for 2006" (b)
We believe that the valuation process should take into account the changing competitive environment, including the emergence of new technologies and evolution of roaming, which may impact Partners' growth prospects and margins
Partners said that its "customers are among the most valuable in the industry" (c)
Nextel generates more lifetime OIBDA per subscriber than Partners and yet traded pre-merger at a substantially lower multiple

Sprint Nextel Observations Regarding Certain Partners Positions
Definition of Fair Market Value
SPRINT NEXTEL VIEW OF PARTNERS POSITION
We believe that in discussing fair market value, Partners has overemphasized premiums Partners seems to suggest that there will be a control premium over DCF value (a)
SPRINT NEXTEL OBSERVATIONS
We believe that the "willing buyer" standard under Partners' charter requires a focus on the intrinsic value of Partners We believe that DCF analysis already presumes the benefit of control over operations and cash flow, therefore an additional control premium over a DCF value is not appropriate (we believe that Delaware law is consistent with this view) (b) We believe that premiums cannot be analyzed in isolation: they are a by-product of valuation analysis, which should reflect deal multiples, synergies and other factors In this case, we believe that synergies are minimal, given the structure of the relationship between Partners and Nextel, including pass-though of systems, products and services

Sprint Nextel Observations Regarding Certain Partners Positions
Definition of Fair Market Value (cont'd)
SPRINT NEXTEL VIEW OF PARTNERS POSITION
Partners states that Fair Market Value definition assumes Partners "would be sold pursuant to a comprehensive auction process" (a)
SPRINT NEXTEL OBSERVATIONS
We believe that, even in an auction environment, a "willing buyer" will be seeking an appropriate return on invested capital and will not knowingly undertake a value-destroying transaction
Partners recites the fact that the charter requires consideration of "unaffected" market prices but does not explain the impact that this might have in these circumstances (b)
We believe that Partners' trading prices have been affected by speculation for an extended period of time
Partners states that "fair market value would be dependent upon Nextel Partners management's estimates of the future performance of the business" (c)
We believe that no "willing buyer" relies solely on the seller's management's estimates We believe that any DCF analysis should be based on realistic assumptions about the future operating environment for Partners
