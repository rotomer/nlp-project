________________________________________________________________________________ Item 1.01 Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement. Annual Award of Restricted Stock Units On June 12, 2006, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Sprint Nextel Corporation ("Sprint Nextel") awarded grants of restricted stock units to non-employee directors of Sprint Nextel and to officers and other eligible employees of Sprint Nextel. The restricted stock units were awarded under Sprint Nextel's 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Program. The awards to non-employee directors constitute the annual grant of $100,000 in restricted stock units. The restricted stock units are normally granted each year at the time of the annual meeting of the board of directors, which coincides with the annual meeting of stockholders. The 2006 awards were not made on April 18, 2006, the date of the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, but were delayed until after the spin-off of Sprint Nextel's local communications business, Embarq Corporation, on May 17, 2006. These restricted stock units vest on the date of the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders. If Sprint Nextel declares a dividend with respect to its common stock, these restricted stock units will accrue additional restricted stock units equal to the number of shares of common stock the dividend would buy at the fair market value of the common stock on the dividend payment date. The awards to officers and other eligible employees, which would normally be granted in February, similarly were delayed until after the spin-off of Embarq. As previously reported in Sprint Nextel's Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 10, 2006, the awards constitute 50 percent of the value of the equity grants by Sprint Nextel under its 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan. These restricted stock units include a performance component, which could result in the number of restricted stock units being forfeited or increased, ranging from 0% to 200% of the number of restricted stock units originally awarded, based on the achievement of specified results with respect to the following performance objectives during 2006: wireless subscriber additions, adjusted OIBDA (operating income plus depreciation, amortization and special items) and post-paid wireless subscriber retention. The restricted stock unit awards vest on February 7, 2009 and are eligible to receive dividend payments as and to the extent declared with respect to Sprint Nextel's common stock. The form of award agreement for non-employee directors is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, the form of award agreement for Timothy M. Donahue, Chairman of the board of directors, is attached as Exhibit 10.2 hereto, the form of award agreement for Gary Forsee, Chief Executive Officer, and Len J.

The Performance Adjustment will be made as soon as practicable after year end 2006. If Executive remains an employee of Sprint throughout 2006, cash dividends on the Common Stock underlying these RSUs during 2006 will be paid to Executive as soon as practicable after the Performance Adjustment. These cash dividends will be calculated by first adjusting the RSUs by the Performance Adjustment and then applying the dividend rate for each quarterly dividend for which Executive held the RSUs, as adjusted, on each dividend record date. After the Performance Adjustment is made, if cash dividends are paid on the underlying Common Stock, Executive will receive cash dividends for RSUs held on the dividend record date as provided in Section 9(c) of the Program. 3.03 Terms for Post-Effective Time LTI Awards. To the extent inconsistent with the standard terms and conditions under the Program, the RSUs will have the terms and conditions of the Post-Effective Time LTI Awards as described in Amendment No. 1 to Employment Agreement and Letter Agreement dated as of March 15, 2005. 3.04 Deferral of delivery not permitted.
