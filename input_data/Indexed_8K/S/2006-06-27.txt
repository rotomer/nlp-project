________________________________________________________________________________ Item 8.01 Other Events. On June 26, 2006, Nextel Partners, Inc. ("Nextel Partners") redeemed for $28.50 per share all of its Class A Common Stock pursuant to the "Put Right" under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Charter"). All shares of the Class B Common Stock of Nextel Partners continue to be outstanding and held by Nextel WIP Corp., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Sprint Nextel Corporation ("Sprint Nextel"). As a result, Nextel WIP Corp. now owns 100% of the capital stock of Nextel Partners. Each outstanding option to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock of Nextel Partners became fully vested at the closing of the redemption and each holder of an option received an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject to the option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the $28.50 redemption price over the exercise price per share of the option. The redemption price of $28.50 per share was determined by an independent third party appraisal process in accordance with the provisions of the Charter after the shareholders of Nextel Partners exercised their right to require the purchase, at fair market value, of the outstanding shares of Nextel Partners stock that Nextel WIP Corp. did not own. The total amount of consideration paid to holders of Class A Common Stock and holders of options to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock was approximately $6.5 billion, funded in cash by Sprint Nextel subsidiaries. A copy of the press release announcing completion of the transaction is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(NYSE: S) announced today the completion of its acquisition of Nextel Partners for approximately $6.5 billion, representing $28.50 per share of Nextel Partners Class A Common stock. Sprint Nextel, which previously owned approximately 31 percent of Nextel Partners common stock, now controls licensed wireless spectrum in 58 additional markets, reaching about 54 million additional people in mid-sized and rural markets in 31 states. With the acquisition, Sprint Nextel has approximately 51 million wireless subscribers, based on first quarter 2006 reporting. "The acquisition of Nextel Partners marks another important milestone as Sprint Nextel executes our vision of converging our unique wireless and Internet wireline assets to create an entirely new suite of mobility and IP-based products and services for our customers," said Sprint Nextel President and CEO Gary Forsee. "With this acquisition, and the expanded Nextel iDEN network footprint, we will be able to offer customers in Nextel Partners' territories the full range of products and services more quickly and efficiently, and we will benefit from managing this part of our business under a consolidated organization and cost structure." The acquisition will be seamless for Nextel Partners' subscribers and all existing sales and customer service channels will remain in place as Sprint Nextel executes a plan to gradually integrate those subscribers and support functions into its existing operations. The Federal Communications Commission announced its approval of the purchase and transfer of more than 6,000 licenses on June 20, and the purchase has received all other required approvals. Nextel Partners' stock (NASDAQ: NXTP) ceased trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange after the market closed today.
