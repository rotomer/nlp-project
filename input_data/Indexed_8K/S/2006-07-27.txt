To determine the value of services for purposes of periodic usage reporting and for IRS Form 1099 reporting each board member will be placed on a consumer account that best fits their total usage. Also, the value of additional services and features (e.g., ringers, call tones, directory assistance), and the retail cost of the wireless units, replacements and associated accessories will be included in the value of the communications benefit. GSM International Phone Rental Board members can request to use a GSM phone when traveling internationally.

Customer Service Each Sprint Nextel board member will receive a card that lists the names and numbers he or she can contact with questions regarding billing issues, long distance, wireless units, Sprint Employee Referral Offer or customer complaints. 1
Taxation Participating directors will pay any personal federal, state or local income taxes on the value of the communications benefit. The value of services will be reflected on the director's Form 1099. Replacement Equipment and Exceptions Sprint Nextel will pay for the replacement of a damaged wireless unit, if not covered by warranty. A director may return the damaged unit for it to go through the refurbishing process. Exceptions for specialized equipment and accessories will be reviewed by the board on a case-by-case basis. There may be other circumstances in which units are provided to board members (e.g., demo units, field testing units, training units, etc.); these units will be converted to a consumer account and will apply toward the wireless units under this communications benefit once the units reach production.
