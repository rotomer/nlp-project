today reported third quarter 2007 financial results. Consolidated net operating revenues in the quarter were $10 billion compared to $10.5 billion in the year-ago third quarter.

costs, was 23 cents in the quarter compared to 32 cents in this quarter of 2006. The decline in earnings is due to a lower contribution from Wireless, partially offset by an improved contribution from Wireline.
The company reported a net decline of 60,000 total wireless subscribers in the third quarter. Overall subscriber results include growth from CDMA post-paid, Boost Unlimited, wholesale and affiliate channels. These gains were offset by declines from iDEN post-paid and traditional Boost pre-paid product lines. In the quarter, post-paid churn was 2.3% on seasonally higher involuntary deactivations and competitive market conditions. The Wireless post-paid ARPU* of a little more than $59 in the quarter continues to be supported by data growth, offset by lower voice contributions.
"Our third quarter results reflect mixed performance as we address competitive market conditions and manage through credit market impacts on a portion of our customer base," said Paul Saleh, acting CEO and chief financial officer of Sprint Nextel. "In the quarter, our Sprint Ahead marketing campaign gained traction, we improved our device portfolio, and we continued to achieve best-ever network performance. Going forward, our clear mandate is to improve the customer experience at every touchpoint and simplify our business. We also plan to focus more resources on customer retention," Saleh said.

Forward-Looking Guidance
Sprint Nextel continues to expect full-year consolidated revenues to be slightly below $41 billion and Adjusted OIBDA* to be slightly below $11 billion. The company expects net customer additions to continue to be pressured in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2007 capital investments are now expected to be in the mid $6 billion range compared to prior expectations of approximately $7.2 billion. The company also noted that it is removing its previous double-digit growth guidance for 2008 OIBDA, and that it expects to comment on the 2008 outlook early next year.
*FINANCIAL MEASURES
Sprint Nextel provides financial measures generated using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and using adjustments to GAAP (non-GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect industry conventions, or standard measures of liquidity, profitability or performance commonly used by the investment community for comparability purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have defined below each of the non-GAAP measures we use, but these measures may not be synonymous to similar measurement terms used by other companies.
Sprint Nextel provides reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures in its financial reporting. Because Sprint Nextel does not predict special items that might occur in the future, and our forecasts are developed at a level of detail different than that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures, Sprint Nextel does not provide reconciliations to GAAP of its forward-looking financial measures.
The measures used in this release include the following:
is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations, before special items, net of tax and the diluted EPS calculated thereon. is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before special items and
Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (EPS)
Adjusted EPS before Amortization
 
amortization, net of tax, and the diluted EPS calculated thereon. These non-GAAP measures should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. We believe that these measures are useful because they allow investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that relate to acquired amortizable intangible assets and not to the ongoing operations of our businesses.

These non-GAAP measures should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. We believe that these measures are useful because they allow investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding items that do not relate to the ongoing operations of our businesses.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss)
Adjusted Net Income before Amortization
is defined as operating income (loss) before special items. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. We believe this measure is useful because it allows investors to evaluate our operating results for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding special items.
Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)
is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, severance, exit costs and asset impairments, and special items. represents Adjusted OIBDA divided by non-equipment net operating revenues for Wireless and Adjusted OIBDA divided by net operating revenues for Long Distance. These non-GAAP measures should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of operations. We believe that Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide useful information to investors because they are an indicator of the strength and performance of our ongoing business operations, including our ability to fund discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, spectrum acquisitions and other investments and our ability to incur and service debt. While depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under generally accepted accounting principles, these expenses primarily represent non-cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin are calculations commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare the periodic and future operating performance and value of companies within the telecommunications industry.
Adjusted OIBDA
Adjusted OIBDA Margin
is defined as the change in cash and cash equivalents less the change in debt, investment in certain securities, proceeds from common stock and other financing activities, net, from continuing operations. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors, analysts and our management about the cash generated by our core operations after interest and dividends and our ability to fund scheduled debt maturities and other financing activities, including discretionary refinancing and retirement of debt and purchase or sale of investments.
Free Cash Flow
is consolidated debt, including current maturities, less cash and cash equivalents, current marketable securities and restricted cash. This non-GAAP measure should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the balance sheet and statement of cash flows. We believe that Net Debt provides useful information to investors, analysts and credit rating agencies about the capacity of the company to reduce the debt load and improve its capital structure.

All merger costs were related to the Sprint-Nextel merger and/or the PCS Affiliates and Nextel Partners' acquisitions. Merger and integration costs are generally non-recurring in nature and primarily include costs to prepare systems for the launch of common customer interfacing systems, processes and other integration and planning activities, certain costs to provide wireless devices that operate seamlessly between the CDMA and iDEN networks, certain customer care costs, costs to retain employees, costs related to re-branding, and other costs. Merger and integration costs related to wireless devices that operate seamlessly between the CDMA and iDEN networks were $36 million for the third quarter 2007 and $113 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
Merger and integration expenses which are solely and directly attributable to the Wireless segment have been allocated to that segment. These expenses are classified as selling, general and administrative, cost of products, or equipment revenues as appropriate on our consolidated statement of operations. Merger and integration expenses that are not solely and directly attributable to the Wireless segment are included in the Corporate segment and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations. In the second quarter of 2007, we reclassified certain historical merger and integration expenses from the Corporate segment to the Wireless segment to conform with the policies described above.
 
In the third quarter ended September 30, 2006, we recorded severance, exit costs and asset impairment charges of $50 million pre-tax ($31 million, net of tax), which consists of $31 million in severance and related costs associated with work force reductions of legacy Sprint employees and $19 million of asset impairments primarily related to software asset impairment and abandonment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, we recorded severance, exit costs and asset impairment charges of $128 million pre-tax ($77 million, net of tax), which consists of about $67 million in severance and related costs associated with work force reductions of legacy Sprint employees and $61 million of asset impairments primarily related to software asset impairment and abandonment. Severance, exit costs and asset impairment charges are allocated to the appropriate segment results.
