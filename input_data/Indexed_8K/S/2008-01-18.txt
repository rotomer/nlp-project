- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. On January 16, 2008, the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel Corporation (the "Company"), in response to anticipated continued pressure on subscriber trends, revenues and profitability in 2008, approved actions to streamline the Company's business and reduce operating costs through (i) a workforce reduction of approximately 4,000 internal positions and reduced utilization of outsourced services and contractors and (ii) the elimination of more than 4,000 third-party distribution points and approximately 125 company-owned retail locations. The employee headcount reductions are expected to be substantially completed in the first half of the year and will include management and non-management positions throughout the Company. The Company expects to record an accounting charge of approximately $200 million for severance and related costs associated with the workforce reduction, primarily determined based on an existing severance plan. Substantially all of the above estimated charge is expected to result in cash expenditures during 2008. The Company also expects to record a charge for exit and other costs associated with the elimination of distribution points and retail locations, but at this time is unable to estimate the costs expected to be incurred and whether these costs are material. If material, the Company will disclose costs related to these actions promptly after they are determined. A copy of the press release announcing these actions is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. On January 18, 2008, the Company announced its subscriber base declined by approximately 109,000 subscribers and post-paid churn of 2.3% for the fourth quarter 2007. As reported in the Company's Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2007, the Company is currently performing its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Given current market conditions, particularly the recent decrease in the Company's stock price, the Company could incur a non-cash impairment charge associated with its goodwill in the fourth quarter 2007. A copy of the press release announcing this information is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits. (d) Exhibits The following exhibits are filed with this report: Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release Announcing Fourth Quarter Subscriber Results and Actions to Streamline Operations

Exhibit 99.1 News Release [SPRINT LOGO] Sprint Nextel 2001 Edmund Halley Drive Reston, Va. 20191 Media Contact: Leigh Horner, 703-433-3044 leigh.horner@sprint.com Investor Contact: Kurt Fawkes, 800-259-3755 investor.relations@sprint.com SPRINT NEXTEL REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER SUBSCRIBER RESULTS, ANNOUNCES ACTIONS TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS RESTON, Va. - Jan. 18, 2008 - Sprint Nextel Corp. (NYSE: S) today reported wireless subscriber results for the fourth quarter of 2007, announced initial plans to streamline its business as part of an ongoing review of its operations and market approach, and provided an update on its annual assessment of the goodwill recorded on its financial statements. For the fourth quarter Sprint Nextel reported a net gain of 500,000 subscribers through wholesale channels, growth of 256,000 Boost Unlimited users and net additions of 20,000 subscribers within affiliate channels. These gains were offset by net losses of 683,000 post-paid subscribers and 202,000 traditional pre-paid users. In the fourth quarter, post-paid churn was 2.3 percent. Compared to the third quarter, improved voluntary churn in both the CDMA and iDEN customer bases was offset by higher involuntary churn. At the end of 2007, Sprint Nextel served a total subscriber base of 53.8 million subscribers including 40.8 million post-paid, 4.1 million traditional pre-paid, 500,000 Boost Unlimited, 7.7 million wholesale and 850,000 subscribers through affiliates. Anticipating continued downward pressure on subscriber trends, revenues, and profitability in 2008, Sprint Nextel also announced initial plans to streamline the business in coming months. These plans call for job reductions across the company including approximately 4,000 internal positions and reduced utilization of outsourced services and contractors. The company also expects to eliminate more than 4,000 third-party distribution points and to close approximately 125, or 8 percent, of its company-owned retail locations. The company has approximately 20,000 total distribution points, including nearly 1,400 company-owned retail locations. Sprint Nextel currently expects these actions to reduce its internal and external labor costs by an annualized rate of $700-$800 million by the end of 2008. The employee headcount reductions are expected to be completed in the first half of the year and will include management and non-management positions throughout the company. The company will offer a voluntary separation plan for its employees, and displaced employees will receive separation pay and outplacement and other services. The company expects to record a first-quarter charge for severance costs associated with the workforce reduction.
Sprint Nextel is currently performing its annual assessment of the goodwill recorded on its financial statements and expects to conclude this process prior to the release of its fourth-quarter earnings report. Given current market conditions, particularly the recent decrease in the company's stock price, Sprint Nextel could determine that it will record a non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill in the fourth quarter 2007. Any such charge would have no affect on either the company's current cash balance or future cash flows. Sprint Nextel currently expects to announce fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 results on Feb. 28.
