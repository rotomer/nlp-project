The Executive further agrees to cooperate with the Company in seeking such order or other remedy and that, if the Company is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Proprietary Information, the Executive will furnish only that portion of the Proprietary Information that is legally required, and the Executive will exercise all legal efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Proprietary Information.
(g) The Executive's obligations under this Section 10 are in addition to, and not in limitation of, all other obligations of confidentiality under the Company's policies, general legal or equitable principles or statutes.
(h) During the Employment Term and following his termination of employment:
(i) the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, make or cause to be made any statements, including but not limited to, comments in books or printed media, to any third parties criticizing or disparaging the Company Group or commenting on the character or business reputation of the Company Group. Without the prior written consent of the Board, unless otherwise required by law, the Executive shall not (A) publicly comment in a manner adverse to the Company Group concerning the status, plans or prospects of the business of the Company Group or (B) publicly comment in a manner adverse to the Company Group concerning the status, plans or prospects of any existing, threatened or potential claims or litigation involving the Company Group;
(ii) the Company shall comply with its policies regarding public statements with respect to the Executive and any such statements shall be deemed to be made by the Company only if made or authorized by a member of the Board or a senior executive officer of the Company; and
(iii) nothing herein precludes honest and good faith reporting by the Executive to appropriate Company or legal enforcement authorities.
(i) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that a violation of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10 would cause irreparable harm to the Company Group, and that the Company's remedy at law for any such violation would be inadequate. In recognition of the
 
foregoing, the Executive agrees that, in addition to any other relief afforded by law or this Agreement, including damages sustained by a breach of this Agreement and any forfeitures under Section 9(g), and without the necessity or proof of actual damages, the Company shall have the right to enforce this Agreement by specific remedies, which shall include, among other things, temporary and permanent injunctions, it being the understanding of the undersigned parties hereto that damages, the forfeitures described above and injunctions shall all be proper modes of relief and are not to be considered as alternative remedies.
11. . In consideration of the Company entering into this Agreement, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the expiration of the Restricted Period:
Non-Competition
(a) The Executive covenants and agrees that the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, engage in any activities on behalf of or have an interest in any Competitor of the Company Group, whether as an owner, investor, executive, manager, employee, independent consultant, contractor, advisor, or otherwise. The Executive's ownership of less than one percent (1%) of any class of stock in a publicly traded corporation shall not be a breach of this paragraph.
(b) A "Competitor" is any entity doing business directly or indirectly (e.g., as an owner, investor, provider of capital or otherwise) in the United States including any territory of the United States (the "Territory") that provides products and/or services that are the same or similar to the products and/or services that are currently being provided at the time of Executive's termination or that were provided by the Company Group during the two-year period prior to the Executive's separation from service with the Company Group.
(c) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that due to the continually evolving nature of the Company Group's industry, the scope of its business and/or the identities of Competitors may change over time. The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the Company Group markets its products and services on a nationwide basis, encompassing the Territory and that the restrictions imposed by this covenant, including the geographic scope, are reasonably necessary to protect the Company Group's legitimate interests.
(d) The Executive covenants and agrees that should a court at any time determine that any restriction or limitation in this Section 11 is unreasonable or unenforceable, it will be deemed amended so as to provide the maximum protection to the Company Group and be deemed reasonable and enforceable by the court.
12. . In consideration of the Company entering into this Agreement, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Executive hereby covenants and agrees that he shall not, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person or entity do or suffer any of the following:
Non-Solicitation
(a) hire or employ or assist in hiring or employing any person who was at any time during the last 18 months of the Executive's employment an employee, representative or agent of any member of the Company Group or solicit, aid, induce or attempt to solicit, aid, induce or persuade, directly or indirectly, any person who is an employee, representative, or
 
agent of any member of the Company Group to leave his or her employment with any member of the Company Group to accept employment with any other person or entity;
(b) induce any person who is an employee, officer or agent of the Company Group, or any of its affiliated, related or subsidiary entities to terminate such relationship;
(c) solicit any customer of the Company Group, or any person or entity whose business the Company Group had solicited during the 180-day period prior to termination of the Executive's employment for purposes of business which is competitive to the Company Group within the Territory; or
(d) solicit, aid, induce, persuade or attempt to solicit, aid, induce or persuade any person or entity to take any action that would result in a Change in Control of the Company or to seek to control the Board in a material manner.
(e) For purposes of this Section 12, the term "solicit or persuade" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with an employee of the Company Group relating to possible employment, (ii) offering bonuses or additional compensation to encourage an employee of the Company Group to terminate his employment, (iii) referring employees of the Company Group to personnel or agents employed by competitors, suppliers or customers of the Company Group, and (iv) initiating communications with any person or entity relating to a possible Change in Control.
13. .
Developments
(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he will make full and prompt disclosure to the Company of all inventions, improvements, discoveries, methods, developments, software, mask works, and works of authorship, whether patentable or copyrightable or not, (i) which relate to the Company's business and have heretofore been created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive or under his direction or jointly with others, and not assigned to prior employers, or (ii) which have utility in or relate to the Company's business and are created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive or under his direction or jointly with others during his employment with the Company, whether or not during normal working hours or on the premises of the Company (all of the foregoing of which are collectively referred to in this Agreement as "Developments").
(b) The Executive further agrees to assign and does hereby assign to the Company (or any person or entity designated by the Company) all of the Executive's rights, title and interest worldwide in and to all Developments and all related patents, patent applications, copyrights and copyright applications, and any other applications for registration of a proprietary right. This Section 13(b) shall not apply to Developments that the Executive developed entirely on his own time without using the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or Proprietary Information and that does not, at the time of conception or reduction to practice, have utility in or relate to the Company's business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development. The Executive understands that, to the extent this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of any Territory which precludes a requirement in an employee agreement to assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this Section 13(b) shall be interpreted
 
not to apply to any invention which a court rules or the Company agrees falls within such classes.
(c) The Executive further agrees to cooperate fully with the Company, both during and after his employment with the Company, with respect to the procurement, maintenance and enforcement of copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights (both in the United States and other countries) relating to Developments. The Executive shall not be required to incur or pay any costs or expenses in connection with the rendering of such cooperation. The Executive will sign all papers, including, without limitation, copyright applications, patent applications, declarations, oaths, formal assignments, assignments of priority rights, and powers of attorney, and do all things that the Company may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development.
(d) The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that if the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure the Executive's signature on any such papers, any executive officer of the Company shall be entitled to execute any such papers as the Executive's agent and attorney-in-fact, and the Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each executive officer of the Company as his agent and attorney-in-fact to execute any such papers on the Executive's behalf, and to take any and all actions as the Company may deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development, under the conditions described in this sentence.
14. . The Executive and the Company agree that the covenants contained in Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 are reasonable under the circumstances, and further agree that if in the opinion of any court of competent jurisdiction any such covenant is not reasonable in any respect, such court will have the right, power and authority to sever or modify any provision or provisions of such covenants as to the court will appear not reasonable and to enforce the remainder of the covenants as so amended. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach of any of the Executive's obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, the Executive acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law, in equity or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of the Executive's violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage. Without limiting the applicability of this Section 14 or in any way affecting the right of the Company to seek equitable remedies hereunder, in the event that the Executive breaches any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or 13 or engages in any activity that would constitute a breach save for the Executive's action being in a state where any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12, 13 or this Section 14 is not enforceable as a matter of law, then the Company's obligation to pay any remaining severance compensation and benefits that has not already been paid to Executive pursuant to Section 9 shall be terminated and within ten days of notice of such termination of payment, the Executive shall return all severance compensation and the value of such benefits, or profits derived or received from such benefits.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim or controversy for injunctive or equitable relief contemplated by or allowed under applicable law pursuant to Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement will be subject to arbitration under this Section 16, but will instead be subject to determination in a court of competent jurisdiction in Kansas, which court shall apply Kansas law consistent with Section 21 of this Agreement, where either Party may seek injunctive or equitable relief.

We refer to this Employment Agreement dated as of May 1, 2008, between you and us as the "Employment Agreement." Certain other capitalized terms used and not defined herein are defined in the Employment Agreement.
1.
Award of Option Right
The Human Capital and Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel granted you an Option Right, effective as of the Effective Date (the "Date of Grant"), to purchase from us 667,201 shares of Series 1 common stock, par value $2.00 per share of Sprint Nextel (the "Common Stock") at an Option Price of $X.XX per share. The Option Right is governed by the terms of the Sprint Nextel Corporation 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and is subject to the terms and conditions described in this Award Agreement. The Option Right is not intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").
2.
When the Option Right Becomes Exercisable
Your Option Right becomes exercisable at a rate of 50 percent of the total number of shares subject to purchase on each of the second and third anniversaries of the Date of Grant, conditioned upon you continuously serving as our employee through those vesting dates. You will forfeit the unvested shares under your Option Right if your service with us ends for any reason, unless vesting accelerates as described in paragraph 3 below.
3.
Acceleration of Vesting
Unvested shares under your Option Right may become vested before the time at which they would normally become vested by the passage of time  that is, the vesting may accelerate. Accelerated vesting can apply in the three circumstances described below.
 
In the following case, vesting of your option will not accelerate, but the option will remain outstanding after your termination of employment (but in no event beyond the Expiration Date of the option).
 
CIC Severance Protection Period is defined in the Plan. It means the time period commencing on the date of the first occurrence of a Change in Control and continuing until the earlier of (i) the 18-month anniversary of such date or (ii) the Participant's death.
Termination Date means your termination of employment, or if, after your involuntary termination you receive severance from us paid according to our payroll
cycle (i.e., not in a lump sum), Termination Date means the last day of your severance pay period.
4.
Exercise of Option Right
To the extent it has vested, you may exercise your Option Right under this Award in whole or in part at the time or times as permitted by the Plan if the Option Right has not otherwise expired, been forfeited or terminated. To exercise you must:
 
 
You may pay the Option Price by
 
 
 
If you pay the Option Price by delivery of funds or shares of Common Stock, the value per share for purposes of determining your taxable income from such an exercise will be the Market Value Per Share of the Common Stock on the immediately preceding day before the exercise except that we will use the average of the high and low prices on that date in lieu of the closing price.
To the extent permitted by law, you may pay the Option Price from the proceeds of a sale through a broker designated by the Treasurer of Sprint Nextel. The Market Value Per Share for purposes of determining your taxable income from such an exercise will be the actual price at which the broker sold the shares.
5.
Expiration of Option Right
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Award Agreement or the Plan, the Option Right granted herein will expire at 4:00 P.M., U.S. Eastern Time, on the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant (the "Expiration Date"). If the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant, however, is a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which the market on which our Common Stock trades is closed (a "Non-Business Day"), then the Expiration Date will occur at 4:00 P.M., U.S. Eastern Time, on the first business day before the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant.
6.
Effect of your Termination of Employment
The length of time you have to exercise your vested Option Right after your termination of employment from us depends on the reason for your termination. The table below describes the post-termination exercise period for the various termination reasons. In no event, however, may you exercise your Option Right after the Expiration Date.
 
If the last day to exercise under the schedule described in the table above is a Non-Business Day, then you must exercise no later than the previous business day.
You are solely responsible for managing the exercise of your Option Award in order to avoid inadvertent expiration.
7.
Transfer of your Option Right and Designation of Beneficiaries
Your Option Right represents a contract between Sprint Nextel and you, and your rights under the contract are not assignable to any other party during your lifetime. Upon your death, your Option Right may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Award by any beneficiary you name in a beneficiary designation or, if you make no designation, by your estate.
8.

Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the timing of any grant, the number of shares underlying the Option Award granted, and vesting provisions.
11.
Data Privacy

Exhibit C
Throughout this Award Agreement we sometimes refer to Sprint Nextel Corporation and its subsidiaries as "we" or "us." We refer to this Employment Agreement dated as of May 1, 2008, between you and us as the "Employment Agreement." Certain other capitalized terms used and not defined herein are defined in the Employment Agreement.
1.
Award of Restricted Stock Units
The Human Capital and Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel granted you an Award, effective as of the Effective Date (the "Date of Grant"), of 469,484 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under the terms of the Sprint Nextel Corporation 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan") as of the Date of Grant. Subject to the restrictions and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, each RSU represents the right for you to receive from us one share of Common Stock on the Vesting Date and gives you the right to dividend equivalents as described in paragraph 3 below. Your right to receive shares of Common Stock under the RSUs is a contractual right between you and us and does not give you a preferred claim to any particular assets or shares of Sprint Nextel.
2.
Restriction Period
Your RSUs vest 50 percent on each of the second and third anniversaries of the Date of Grant, or on the date vesting is accelerated as described in paragraph 5 below (the "Vesting Date"), conditioned upon you continuously serving as our employee through that Vesting Date. RSUs that are subject to forfeiture on your termination of service as an employee are called "unvested RSUs," and RSUs no longer subject to forfeiture or restrictions on transfer are called "vested RSUs."
3.
Dividends
If cash dividends are paid on the Common Stock underlying your RSUs, and you hold the RSUs on the dividend record date, each year you will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of the dividend that would be paid on the Common Stock underlying your RSUs.
If non-cash dividends are paid on the Common Stock underlying your RSUs, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may (1) adjust the RSUs as described in Section 9 of this Award Agreement or, (2) provide for distribution of the property distributed in the non-cash dividend. If the Compensation Committee provides for distribution of the non-cash dividend, and you hold the RSUs on the dividend record date, your vesting and delivery dates for the property distributed on the Common Stock underlying your RSUs will be the same as those dates for the RSUs.
4.
Forfeiture of RSUs
You will forfeit unvested RSUs if you terminate your service with us for any reason (unless vesting of your RSUs accelerates under paragraph 5).
5.
Acceleration of Vesting; Continued Vesting during Separation Pay Period
Unvested RSUs may become vested RSUs before the time at which they would normally become vested  that is, the vesting of RSUs may accelerate. Accelerated vesting occurs under the three circumstances described below:
 
In the following case, vesting of your RSUs will not accelerate, but the RSUs will remain outstanding after your termination of employment.
 
Termination Date means your termination of employment, or if, after your involuntary termination you receive severance from us paid according to our payroll cycle (i.e., not in a lump sum), Termination Date means the last day of your severance pay period.
Separation from Service is defined in the Plan. Generally, it means the date of your termination of employment with us. To contrast the date of your Separation from Service from your Termination Date, if you are involuntarily terminated and receive severance pay from us, your Separation from Service would occur on the last day you actually worked for us and your Termination Date would occur on the last day of your severance pay period.
Six-Month Payment Delay is defined in the Plan to mean the required delay in payment to a Participant who is a "specified employee" of amounts subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") that are paid upon Separation from Service. Specified employees, generally, are our 50 highest paid officers.
CIC Severance Protection Period is defined in the Plan. It means the time period commencing on the date of the first occurrence of a Change in Control and continuing until the earlier of (i) the 18-month anniversary of such date or (ii) the Participant's death.
6.
Delivery Date; Market Value Per Share
The Delivery Date is the date as of which we distribute the Common Stock underlying the RSUs to you. It is the Vesting Date, or the day after the Six-Month Payment Delay if that delay applies to your RSUs. We calculate your taxable income on the Delivery Date using the Market Value Per Share on the immediately preceding trading day, but we use the average of the high and low reported prices of our Common Stock instead of the closing price. We will distribute the Common Stock underlying the RSUs, as soon as practicable after the Delivery Date, but in no event later than 45 days after the Delivery Date.
7.
Transfer of your RSUs and Designation of Beneficiaries
Your RSUs represents a contract between Sprint Nextel and you, and your rights under the contract are not assignable to any other party during your lifetime. Upon your death, shares of Common Stock underlying your RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the terms of the Award to any beneficiaries you name in a beneficiary designation or, if you make no designation, to your estate.
8.

10.
Amendment; Discretionary Nature of Plan
This Award Agreement is subject to the terms of the Plan, as may be amended from time to time, except that the Award which is the subject of this Award Agreement may not be materially impaired by any amendment or termination of the Plan approved after the Date of Grant without your written consent.

We will withhold from the total number of shares of Common Stock you are to receive the value equal to the amount necessary to satisfy any such withholding obligation at the minimum applicable withholding rate. In addition, if
you become subject to FICA or Medicare tax, but you are not yet entitled to delivery of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs, you hereby authorize us to withhold the resulting FICA or Medicare tax from other income payable to you.
