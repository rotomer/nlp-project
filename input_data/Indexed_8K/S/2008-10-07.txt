(b) On October 7, 2008, Sprint Nextel Corporation ("Sprint Nextel") announced that William Arendt is being succeeded by Chris Gregoire as principal accounting officer effective October 2, 2008. (c) On October 7, 2008, Sprint Nextel announced that Christopher Gregoire, 39, has been appointed Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer of Sprint Nextel effective October 2, 2008. Mr. Gregoire served as Vice President and Assistant Controller of Sprint Nextel from August 2006 through October 2, 2008. Prior to joining Sprint Nextel, Mr. Gregoire served as a Partner at Deloitte from August 2003 through July 2006 and as a Senior Manager at Deloitte from 2000. In connection with Mr. Gregoire's appointment, his severance benefit has been changed. Mr. Gregoire would have been entitled to severance of two times his base salary and 80% of his short term incentive opportunity ("STI") if his position as Vice President and Assistant Controller was relocated more than 50 miles from Sprint Nextel's Reston, Virginia office on or before August 7, 2009. Sprint Nextel has now agreed to provide those severance benefits, and two years of continuation of certain employee benefits as provided under the Sprint Nextel Separation Plan, in the event of Mr. Gregoire's involuntary termination not for cause and further that he will be involuntarily terminated not for cause no later than August 7, 2009. These new benefits will be in lieu of the severance benefits to which Mr. Gregoire would have been entitled to under Sprint Nextel's severance plan, which would have been about ten months of his base salary and ten months of STI bonus at 80% of his target in the event of involuntary termination not for cause.
