(ii) the Company shall refrain from making any statements about Executive that would disparage, or reflect unfavorably upon the image or reputation of Executive; , , that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Company from complying with its policies regarding public statements with respect to the Executive, or otherwise complying with applicable law, and any such statements shall be deemed to be made by the Company only if made or authorized by a member of the Board or a senior executive officer of the Company; and
provided
however
 
(iii) nothing herein precludes honest and good faith reporting by the Executive to appropriate Company or legal enforcement authorities or otherwise complying with applicable law.
(i) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that a violation of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10 would cause irreparable harm to the Company Group, and that the Company's remedy at law for any such violation would be inadequate. In recognition of the foregoing, the Executive agrees that, in addition to any other relief afforded by law or this Agreement, including damages sustained by a breach of this Agreement and any forfeitures under Section 9(g), and without the necessity or proof of actual damages, the Company shall have the right to enforce this Agreement by specific remedies, which shall include, among other things, temporary and permanent injunctions, it being the understanding of the undersigned parties hereto that damages, the forfeitures described above and injunctions shall all be proper modes of relief and are not to be considered as alternative remedies.
11. . In consideration of the Company entering into this Agreement, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the expiration of the Restricted Period:
Non-Competition
(a) The Executive covenants and agrees that the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, engage in any activities on behalf of or have an interest in any Competitor of the Company Group, whether as an owner, investor, executive, manager, employee, independent consultant, contractor, advisor, or otherwise. The Executive's ownership of less than one percent (1%) of any class of stock in a publicly traded corporation shall not be a breach of this paragraph.
(b) "Competitor" means, at the time of Executive's termination of employment for any reason, any individual, corporation, partnership, association, joint venture, or trust (a "Person") or any of such Person's Divisions doing business in the United States including any territory of the United States (the "Territory") or any of such Person's Divisions employing the Executive if such Person or its Division: (i) receives at least 15% of its gross operating revenues from providing communications services of any type (for example, voice, data, including Internet, and video), which services are transmitted via any transmission medium (for example, wireline, wireless, or any other technology), over any distance (for example, local, long distance, and distance insensitive services), using any protocol (for example, circuit switched or packet-based, such as Internet Protocol); (ii) receives at least 15% of its gross operating revenue from a line of business in which the Company Group receives at least 3% of its operating revenues; (iii) is operating for less than 5 years a line of business from which the Company Group derives at least 3% of gross operating revenues, notwithstanding such Person's or Division's lack of substantial revenues in such line of business; (iv) receives at least 15% of its gross operating revenue from a line of business in which the Company Group has operated for less than 5 years, notwithstanding the Company Group's lack of substantial revenues in such line of business; or (v) is engaged in any activity or has an interest in any activity in which Proprietary Information to which the Executive had access at any time during the two-year period before his termination of employment could be of substantial economic value to the Person or its Division. For this purpose, "Division" means any distinct group, subsidiary, or unit organized as a segment or portion of a Person that is devoted to the production, provision, or management of a common product or service or group of related products or services, regardless of whether the group is organized as a legally distinct entity.
 
For purposes of the foregoing, gross operating revenues of the Company Group and such other Person shall be those of the Company Group or such Person, together with their Company Group, but those of any Division employing or proposing to employ Executive shall be on a stand-alone basis, all measured by the most recent available financial information of both the Company Group and such other Person or Division at the time Executive accepts, or proposes to accept, employment with or to otherwise perform services for such Person or Division. If financial information is not publicly available or is inadequate for purposes of applying this definition, the ultimate burden shall be on Executive to present information that such Person or Division is not a Competitor.
(c) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of this Section 11, due to the continually evolving nature of the Company Group's industry, the scope of its business and/or the identities of Competitors may change over time and that breach of this Agreement by accepting employment with a Competitor would irreparably injure the Company Group. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the Company Group currently markets its products and services on a nationwide basis, encompassing the Territory, and may expand such Territory to include any international and foreign markets, in which case the Parties acknowledge that the terms and provisions of this Section 11 shall apply to such expanded markets.
(d) The Executive covenants and agrees that should a court at any time determine that any restriction or limitation in this Section 11 is unreasonable or unenforceable, it will be deemed amended so as to provide the maximum protection to the Company Group and be deemed reasonable and enforceable by the court.
12. . In consideration of the Company entering into this Agreement, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Executive hereby covenants and agrees that he shall not individually or in cooperation with any other person or entity do or suffer any of the following:
Non-Solicitation
(a) solicit, aid, induce or persuade, directly or indirectly, any person who is an employee, representative, or agent of any member of the Company Group to leave his or her employment with any member of the Company Group to accept employment with any other person or entity;
(b) induce any person who is an employee, officer or agent of the Company Group, or any of its affiliated, related or subsidiary entities to terminate such relationship;
(c) solicit any customer of the Company Group, or any person or entity whose business the Company Group had solicited during the 180-day period prior to termination of the Executive's employment for purposes of business which is competitive to the Company Group within the Territory; or
 
(d) solicit, aid, induce, persuade or attempt to solicit, aid, induce or persuade any person or entity to take any action that would result in a Change in Control of the Company or to seek to control the Board in a material manner without prior written consent.
(e) For purposes of this Section 12 the term "solicit or persuade" includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with an employee of the Company Group relating to possible employment, (ii) offering bonuses or additional compensation to encourage an employee of the Company Group to terminate his employment, and (iii) initiating communications with any person or entity relating to a possible Change in Control.
13. .
Developments
(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he will make full and prompt disclosure to the Company of all inventions, improvements, discoveries, methods, developments, software, mask works, and works of authorship, whether patentable or copyrightable or not, (i) which relate to the Company's business and have heretofore been created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive or under his direction or jointly with others, and not assigned to prior employers, or (ii) which have utility in or relate to the Company's business and are created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive or under his direction or jointly with others during his employment with the Company, whether or not during normal working hours or on the premises of the Company (all of the foregoing of which are collectively referred to in this Agreement as "Developments").
(b) The Executive further agrees to assign and does hereby assign to the Company (or any person or entity designated by the Company) all of the Executive's rights, title and interest worldwide in and to all Developments and all related patents, patent applications, copyrights and copyright applications, and any other applications for registration of a proprietary right. This Section 13(b) shall not apply to Developments that the Executive developed entirely on his own time without using the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or Proprietary Information and that does not, at the time of conception or reduction to practice, have utility in or relate to the Company's business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development. The Executive understands that, to the extent this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of any Territory which precludes a requirement in an employee agreement to assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this Section 13(b) shall be interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules or the Company agrees falls within such classes.
(c) The Executive further agrees to cooperate fully with the Company, both during and after his employment with the Company, with respect to the procurement, maintenance and enforcement of copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights (both in the United States and other countries) relating to Developments. The Executive shall not be required to incur or pay any costs or expenses in connection with the rendering of such cooperation. The Executive will sign all papers, including, without limitation, copyright applications, patent applications, declarations, oaths, formal assignments, assignments of priority rights, and powers of attorney, and do all things that the Company may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development.
 
(d) The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that if the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure the Executive's signature on any such papers, any executive officer of the Company shall be entitled to execute any such papers as the Executive's agent and attorney-in-fact, and the Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each executive officer of the Company as his agent and attorney-in-fact to execute any such papers on the Executive's behalf, and to take any and all actions as the Company may deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development, under the conditions described in this sentence.
14. . The Executive and the Company agree that the covenants contained in Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 are reasonable under the circumstances, and further agree that if in the opinion of any court of competent jurisdiction any such covenant is not reasonable in any respect, such court will have the right, power and authority to sever or modify any provision or provisions of such covenants as to the court will appear not reasonable and to enforce the remainder of the covenants as so amended. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach of any of the Executive's obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, the Executive acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law, in equity or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of the Executive's violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage. Without limiting the applicability of this Section 14 or in any way affecting the right of the Company to seek equitable remedies hereunder, in the event that the Executive materially and willfully breaches any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or 13 or engages in any activity that would constitute a material and willful breach save for the Executive's action being in a state where any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12, 13 or this Section 14 is not enforceable as a matter of law, then the Company's obligation to pay any remaining severance compensation and benefits that has not already been paid to Executive pursuant to Section 9 shall be terminated.
Remedies
15. .
Continued Availability and Cooperation
(a) Following termination of the Executive's employment, the Executive agrees that, consistent with the Executive's business and personal affairs, he will cooperate fully with the Company and with the Company's counsel in connection with any present and future actual or threatened litigation, administrative proceeding or investigation involving the Company that relates to events, occurrences or conduct occurring (or claimed to have occurred) during the period of the Executive's employment by the Company. Cooperation will include, but is not limited to:
(i) making himself reasonably available for interviews and discussions with the Company's counsel as well as for depositions and trial testimony;
 
(ii) if depositions or trial testimony are to occur, making himself reasonably available and cooperating in the preparation therefore, as and to the extent that the Company or the Company's counsel reasonably requests;
(iii) refraining from impeding in any way the Company's prosecution or defense of such litigation or administrative proceeding; and
(iv) cooperating fully in the development and presentation of the Company's prosecution or defense of such litigation or administrative proceeding.
(b) The Company will reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel, lodging, telephone and similar expenses, as well as reasonable attorneys' fees (if independent legal counsel is necessary), incurred in connection with any cooperation, consultation and advice rendered under this Agreement after the Executive's termination of employment.
16. .
Dispute Resolution
(a) In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or breach thereof, either Party shall refer the dispute to binding arbitration, which shall be the exclusive forum for resolving such claims. Such arbitration will be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") pursuant to its Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures and governed by Kansas law. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by the Parties according to the rules of JAMS. In the event that the Parties fail to agree on the selection of the arbitrator within 30 days after either Party's request for arbitration, the arbitrator will be chosen by JAMS. The arbitration proceeding shall commence on a mutually agreeable date within 90 days after the request for arbitration, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, and in the location where the Executive worked during the six months immediately prior to the request for arbitration if that location is in Kansas or Virginia, and if not, the location will be Kansas, unless the Parties agree otherwise.
(b) The Parties agree that each will bear their own costs and attorneys' fees. The arbitrator shall not have authority to award attorneys' fees or costs to any Party.
(c) The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to make awards or orders granting relief that would not be available to a Party in a court of law. The arbitrator's award is limited by and must comply with this Agreement and applicable federal, state, and local laws. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim or controversy for injunctive or equitable relief contemplated by or allowed under applicable law pursuant to Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement will be subject to arbitration under this Section 16, but will instead be subject to determination in a court of competent jurisdiction in Kansas, which court shall apply Kansas law consistent with Section 21 of this Agreement, where either Party may seek injunctive or equitable relief.
17. . No agreements (other than the agreements evidencing any grants of equity awards) or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to
Other Agreements
 
the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(pp) "Separation from Service" means "separation from service" from the Company and its subsidiaries as described under Section 409A of the Code and the guidance and Treasury regulations issued thereunder. Separation from Service will occur on the date on which the Executive's level of services to the Company decreases to 21 percent or less of the average level of services performed by the Executive over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or if providing services for less than 36 months, such lesser period) after taking into account any services that the Executive provided prior to such date or that the Company and the Executive reasonably anticipate the Executive may provide (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) after such date. For purposes of the determination of whether the Executive has had a Separation from Service, the term "Company" shall mean the Company and any affiliate with which the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code, provided that in applying Sections 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Code for purposes of determining a controlled group of corporations under Section 414(b) of the Code, the language "at least 50 percent" is used instead of "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Sections 1563(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Code, and in applying Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(c)-2 for purposes of determining trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) that are under common control for purposes of Section 414(c) of the Code, "at least 50 percent" is used instead of "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(c)-2. In addition, where the use of such definition of "Company" for purposes of determining a Separation from Service is based upon legitimate business criteria, in applying Sections 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Code for purposes of determining a controlled group of corporations under Section 414(b) of the Code, the language "at least 20 percent" is used instead of "at least 80 percent" at each place it appears in Sections 1563(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Code,
 
and in applying Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(c)-2 for purposes of determining trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) that are under common control for purposes of Section 414(c) of the Code, "at least 20 percent" is used instead of "at least 80 percent" at each place it appears in Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(c)-2.
(qq) "Separation Plan" means the Company's Separation Plan Amended and Restated Effective August 13, 2006, as may be amended from time to time or any successor plan, program, arrangement or agreement thereto.
(rr) "Specified Employee" shall mean an Executive who is a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, as administratively determined by the Board in accordance with the guidance and Treasury regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code.
(ss) "STIP" means the Company's short-term incentive plan under Section 8 of the Company's 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan, effective May 8, 2007, as may be amended from time to time, or any successor plan, program or arrangement thereto.
(tt) "Subsidiary" shall mean any entity, corporation, partnership (general or limited), limited liability company, entity, firm, business organization, enterprise, association or joint venture in which the Company directly or indirectly controls ten percent (10%) or more of the voting interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of Section 3(a), "Subsidiary" shall mean any affiliate with which the Company would be considered a single employer as described in the definition of Separation from Service.
(uu) "Target Bonuses" has the meaning set forth in Section 4(b)(i).
(vv) "Territory" has the meaning set forth in Section 11(b).
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to be signed by an officer pursuant to the authority of its Board, and the Executive has executed this Agreement, as of the day and year first written above.
 
 
Throughout this Evidence of Award we sometimes refer to Sprint Nextel Corporation and its subsidiaries as "we" or "us."
1.
Award of Option Right
The Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel has granted you an Option Right to purchase from us 3,275,000 shares of Series 1 common stock, par value $2.00 per share of Sprint Nextel (the "Common Stock") at Option Prices as follows:
 
The Option Right is governed by the terms of the Sprint Nextel Corporation 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and is subject to the terms and conditions described in this Evidence of Award. The Option Right is not intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").
2.
When the Option Right Becomes Exercisable
Your Option Right becomes exercisable at a rate of
 1
/
3
rd
of the total number of shares subject to purchase on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant, conditioned upon you continuously serving as our employee through those vesting dates. You will forfeit the unvested shares under your Option Right if your service with us ends for any reason, unless vesting accelerates as described in paragraph 3 below. These rules, and the post-termination exercise periods are described in Section 6 of this Evidence of Award below.
3.
Acceleration of Vesting
Unvested shares under your Option Right may become vested before the time at which they would normally become vested by the passage of time  that is, the vesting may accelerate. Accelerated vesting occurs upon (1) your termination of service because of your death or Disability, (2) your Termination Date (as defined in paragraph 6 below) if your
 
employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or if you resign with Good Reason or (3) under the conditions described in Section 13(a) of the Plan in connection with a Change in Control of Sprint Nextel in which the Option Right is not assumed, converted or replaced by the resulting entity.
4.
Exercise of Option Right
To the extent it has vested, you may exercise your Option Right under this Award in whole or in part at the time or times as permitted by the Plan if the Option Right has not otherwise expired, been forfeited or terminated. You exercise by delivering a written election under procedures established by the Treasurer of Sprint Nextel (including by approved electronic medium) and paying the Option Price. You may pay the Option Price by
 
 
or by any combination of cash, shares of Common Stock and other consideration as the Committee may permit.
To the extent permitted by law, you may pay the Option Price from the proceeds of a sale through a broker designated by the Treasurer of Sprint Nextel. The Market Value Per Share for purposes of determining your taxable income from such an exercise will be the actual price at which the broker sold the shares.
5.
Expiration of Option Right
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Evidence of Award or the Plan, the Option Right granted herein will expire at 4:00 P.M., U.S. Eastern Time, on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date (the "Expiration Date"). If the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date, however, is a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which the market on which our Common Stock trades is closed (a "Non-Business Day"), then the Expiration Date will occur at 4:00 P.M., U.S. Eastern Time, on the first business day before the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date.
6.
Effect of your Termination of Employment
If you cease to be an employee of Sprint Nextel for any reason, the effect on your Option Right is described below. In no event may your Option Right be exercised after the Expiration Date. If, after your termination by the Company without Cause or your resignation with Good Reason, you receive salary continuation paid according to the payroll cycle (i.e., not in a lump sum), Termination Date for purpose of this table means the last day of your severance pay period.
 
If the last day to exercise according to this schedule is a "Non-Business Day", then the last day to exercise will occur at 4:00 P.M., U.S. Eastern Time, on the first business day before that day.
7.
Award of Restricted Stock Units
The Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel has granted you an Award of 718,907 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under the terms of the Plan as of the Date of Grant. Each RSU represents the right for you to receive from us one share of Common Stock on the delivery date. In addition, each RSU gives you the right to dividend equivalents as described in paragraph 11 below. Your right to receive shares of Common Stock under the RSUs is a contractual right between you and us and does not give you a preferred claim to any particular assets or shares of Sprint Nextel.
8.
Restriction Period and Payment
Your RSUs are subject to the restrictions and conditions in this Evidence of Award. Your RSUs vest at a rate of l/3
rd
of the total number of shares subject to RSUs on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant. However, vesting of your RSUs may accelerate as described in paragraph 10 below. RSUs that are subject to forfeiture on your termination of service as an employee are called "unvested RSUs," and RSUs no longer subject to forfeiture or restrictions on transfer are called "vested RSUs." The date on which the RSU becomes vested is its "vesting date." You will be entitled to receive payment on your vested RSUs in accordance with the terms of your Employment Agreement.
9.
Forfeiture of RSUs
You will forfeit unvested RSUs if you terminate your service with Sprint Nextel for any reason (unless vesting of your RSUs accelerates under paragraph 10).
 
10.
Acceleration of Vesting
Unvested RSUs may become vested RSUs before the time at which they would normally become vested by the passage of time  that is, the vesting of RSUs may accelerate. Accelerated vesting occurs upon (1) your Separation from Service because of your death or Disability, (2) your Separation from Service if your employment is terminated in accordance with the terms of your Employment Agreement following your Separation from Service resulting from your termination by the Company without Cause or if you resign with Good Reason or (3) under the conditions described in Section 13(a) of the Plan in connection with a Change in Control of Sprint Nextel in which the RSUs are not assumed, converted or replaced by the resulting entity.
11.
Dividend Equivalents
. If cash dividends are paid on the Common Stock underlying your unvested RSUs, and you hold those RSUs on the dividend record date, you will accrue additional whole or fractional RSUs equal to the number of shares of Common Stock the dividend would buy at the Market Value Per Share on the dividend payment date. These additional RSUs will vest and be subject to delivery at the same time, and have the same terms, as the original RSU award.
Uninvested RSUs
. If cash dividends are paid on the Common Stock underlying your vested RSUs, and you hold those RSUs on the dividend record date, you will receive on the dividend payment date a cash payment equal to the amount of the dividend paid on the underlying stock.
Vested RSUs

N, T, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is mutually acknowledged by the parties, the parties hereby amend and restate the Original Employment Agreement as follows:
OW
HEREFORE
 
 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to continue to employ Executive as Chief Information and Network Officer, with such authority, power, responsibilities, and duties customarily exercised by a person holding such position in a company of the size and nature of the Company.
Executive shall, during her employment with the Company, owe an undivided duty of loyalty to the Company and agrees to use her best efforts to promote and develop the business of the Company. Executive agrees that, during her employment with the Company, she must devote her full business time, energies, and talents to serving as a senior executive officer of the Company and that she shall perform her duties faithfully and efficiently subject to the directions of the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may, subject in all cases to the Company's Principles of Business Conduct (or any successor code of conduct) (i) serve as a director, trustee, or officer or otherwise participate in not-for-profit educational, welfare, social, religious, and civic organizations; (ii) serve as a director of any for-profit business listed on Exhibit A hereto or, with the prior consent of the Board, serve as a director of any for-profit business that is not a Competitor; and (iii) acquire passive investment interests in one or more entities, to the extent that the other activities do not inhibit or interfere with the performance of Executive's duties under this Agreement, or to the knowledge of Executive conflict in any material way with the business or policies of the Company.
 
The term of Executive's employment under this Agreement (the "") began on the Effective Date and ends on Executive's 65th birthday (the ""). This Agreement sets forth certain terms of Executive's employment during the Employment Term, the consequences of any termination of employment during the Employment Term, and the terms of certain restrictive covenants by Executive during and after the Employment Term. The Company and Executive agree that the employment relationship is at will, and either party may terminate the employment relationship for any reason in accordance with the procedures and with the consequences set forth in this Agreement.
Employment Term
End Date
 
 
Except as set forth below, any purported termination of this Agreement or of Executive's employment by the Company or by Executive during the Employment Term, other than by Executive's death, shall be communicated by a written notice of termination to the other party hereto delivered in accordance with Section 14 below indicating the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination under the provision so indicated. Any such termination will be effective on the Termination Date.
 
The Company may not terminate Executive's employment for Cause during the Employment Term until it delivers to Executive a written notice stating that Executive is guilty of conduct constituting Cause by reference to one or more clauses of Section 6.06 and specifying the particulars thereof in reasonable detail.
 
Executive may terminate her employment for CIC Good Reason during the Employment Term only within the CIC Protected Period following written notice and an opportunity for the Company to cure; provided, however, that Executive may not give notice of termination for CIC Good Reason during any Period in which Executive is unable to substantially perform her duties with the Company due to physical or mental illness. In order to effect a termination for CIC Good Reason, Executive must, within 60 days following the event or circumstance giving rise to Executive's claim, deliver a written notice to the Company that sets forth the specific event or circumstance giving rise to CIC Good Reason by reference to one or more clauses of the definition of CIC Good Reason set forth in Section 6.09 of this Agreement. If, within 30 days following notice from Executive, the Company corrects, in all material respects, the events or circumstances giving rise to Executive's claim for CIC Good Reason, Executive shall not be entitled to terminate her employment for CIC Good Reason by reason of such event or circumstance.
 
Executive may terminate her employment for Non-CIC Good Reason any time during the Employment Term following written notice and an opportunity for the Company to cure. In order to effect a termination for Non-CIC Good Reason, Executive must deliver a written notice to the Company within 60 days following the event or circumstance giving rise to Executive's claim of Non-CIC Good Reason. The notice must set forth the specific event or circumstance giving rise to Non-CIC Good Reason by reference to one or more clauses of the definition of Non-CIC Good Reason set forth in Section 6.24 of this Agreement. If, within 30 days following notice from Executive, the Company corrects, in all material respects, the events or circumstances giving rise to Executive's claim for Non-CIC Good Reason, Executive shall not be entitled to terminate her employment for Non-CIC Good Reason by reason of such event or circumstance.
 
Upon a termination of Executive's employment hereunder for any reason, Executive or, in the event of her death, Executive's estate, in addition to any other payments or benefits to which Executive may be entitled hereunder, is entitled to
 
 
 
 
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company must pay any other employee benefits to which Executive is entitled by reason of her employment to Executive or her estate at the time or times required by the terms of the applicable Company plan or policy.
 
If, on the Termination Date, Executive (i) is a member of the Board or any board of directors of one of Sprint's subsidiaries, (ii) serves on the board of directors of any other corporation by nomination, appointment, or designation by Sprint or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) holds any other position with Sprint or any of its subsidiaries, Executive shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, be deemed to have resigned from all such positions as of the Termination Date. Executive agrees to execute such documents and take such other actions as the Company may request to reflect such resignations.
 
Payments under Section 4 are conditioned on Executive's compliance with the requirements of Section 4.03(b).
 
At the Company's request, Executive shall participate in an exit interview prior to Executive's last day worked as an employee of the Company to provide for the orderly transition of her duties, to arrange for the return of the Company's property, to discuss her intended new employment, and to discuss and complete such other matters as may be necessary to ensure full compliance with this Agreement.
 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Employment Term, while Executive is employed by the Company, the Company will compensate her for her services as follows:
 
Executive shall receive an annual base salary in an amount not less than her annual salary on the Effective Date, payable in monthly or more frequent installments in accordance with the Company's payroll policies and practices (such annual base salary as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.01 shall hereinafter be referred to as the ""). Executive's Base Salary shall be reviewed, and may be increased but not decreased below the rate in effect on the Effective Date (other than across-the-board reductions similarly affecting all Senior Officers), by the Board in a manner that is fair and pursuant to its normal performance review policies for Senior Officers.
Base Salary
 
Executive will continue to participate in the Incentive Plan, subject to its terms and conditions as they may from time to time be established, amended, interpreted, or terminated in accordance with the Company's plans or policies governing such benefits to the Company's Senior Officers
 
generally. Executive's Targeted Compensation under the Incentive Plan shall be reviewed, and may be increased but not decreased below her Targeted Compensation in effect in 2003 (other than across-the-board reductions similarly affecting all Senior Officers), by the Board in a manner that is fair and pursuant to its normal performance review policies for Senior Officers.
 
The Company will provide Executive with the employee benefits (including, without limitation, life, disability, medical and dental insurance coverage, participation in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, Savings Plan, and the Pension Plan, and other benefits generally provided to Senior Officers) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Executive than those provided to her as of the Effective Date, subject to amendment, modification, interpretation by the Company, or termination in accordance with the Company's plans or policies governing such benefits to Senior Officers generally.
 
The Company will reimburse Executive for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred and accounted for in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Company for Senior Officers generally, as they may from time to time be established, interpreted, amended, or terminated.
 
 
Executive shall adhere in all respects to the Company's Principles of Business Conduct (or any successor code of conduct) as they may from time to time be established, interpreted, amended, or terminated.
 
Executive acknowledges that during the course of her employment she has learned or will learn or develop Proprietary Information. Executive further acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of such Proprietary Information, other than in discharge of Executive's duties, will cause the Company irreparable harm. Except in the course of her employment with the Company under this Agreement, in the pursuit of the business of the Company, or as otherwise required in employment with the Company, Executive shall not, during the course of her employment or at any time following termination of her employment, directly or indirectly, disclose, publish, communicate, or use on her behalf or another's behalf, any Proprietary Information. If during or after her employment Executive has any questions about whether particular information is Proprietary Information she shall consult with the Company's Corporate Secretary or other representative designated by the Company.
Executive also agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any information, ideas, or inventions made or conceived by her that result from or are suggested by services performed by her for the Company under this Agreement, and to assign to the Company all rights pertaining to such information, ideas, or inventions. Knowledge or information of any kind disclosed by Executive to the Company shall be deemed to have been disclosed without obligation on the part of the
 
Company to hold the same in confidence, and the Company shall have the full right to use and disclose such knowledge and information without compensation to Executive beyond that specifically provided in this Agreement.
 
During Executive's employment with the Company and during the Non-Compete Period, Executive shall not engage in Competitive Employment, whether paid or unpaid and whether as a consultant, employee, or otherwise. This provision shall not apply if, within one year following a Change in Control:
 
 
If Executive ceases to be employed by the Company because of the sale, spin-off, divestiture, or other disposition by the Company of a subsidiary, division, or other divested unit employing Executive, this provision shall continue to apply during the Non-Compete Period, except that Executive's continued employment for the subsidiary, division, or other divested unit disposed of by the Company shall not be deemed a violation of this provision.
Executive agrees that because of the worldwide nature of the Company's business, breach of this Agreement by accepting Competitive Employment would irreparably injure the Company and that, therefore, a limited geographic restriction is neither feasible nor appropriate to protect the Company's interests.
 
During Executive's employment with the Company and during the Non-Compete Period, Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit, induce, or encourage any employee, consultant, agent, or customer of the Company, or vendor or other parties doing business with the Company, to terminate their employment, agency, or other relationship with the Company or to render services for or transfer business to any Competitor, and Executive shall not initiate discussion with any such person for any such purpose or authorize or knowingly cooperate with the taking of any such actions by any other individual or entity on behalf of the Competitor.
 
During the Non-Compete Period, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, in any manner, solicit, request, advise, or assist any other person to (a) undertake any action that would be reasonably likely to, or is intended to, result in a Change in Control, or (b) seek to control in any material manner the Board.
 
Executive shall, upon her Termination Date, return to the Company all property of the Company in her possession, including all notes, reports, sketches, plans, published memoranda, or other
 
documents, whether in hard copy or in electronic form, created, developed, generated, received, or held by Executive during her employment, concerning or related to the Company's business, whether containing or relating to Proprietary Information or not. Executive shall not remove, by e-mail, by removal of computer discs or hard drives, or by other means, any of the above property containing Proprietary Information, or reproductions or copies thereof, or any apparatus from the Company's premises without the Company's written consent.
 
Executive agrees to refrain from making any statements about the Company or its officers or directors that would disparage, or reflect unfavorably upon the image or reputation of the Company or any such officer or director. The Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to prevent its directors and officers from making any statements about Executive that would disparage, or reflect unfavorably upon the image or reputation of, Executive.
 
Executive agrees that, consistent with Executive's business and personal affairs, during and after her employment by the Company, she will assist the Company in the defense of any claims or potential claims that may be made or threatened to be made against it in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative ("") and will assist the Company in the prosecution of any claims that may be made by the Company in any Proceeding, to the extent that such claims may relate to Executive's services provided under this Agreement.
Proceeding
Executive agrees, unless precluded by law, to promptly inform the Company if Executive is asked to participate (or otherwise become involved) in any Proceeding involving such claims or potential claims.
Executive also agrees, unless precluded by law, to promptly inform the Company if Executive is asked to assist in any investigation (whether governmental or private) of the Company (or its actions), regardless of whether a lawsuit has then been filed against the Company with respect to such investigation. The Company agrees to reimburse Executive for all of Executive's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such assistance, including travel expenses and any attorneys' fees and shall pay a reasonable per diem fee (equal to 1/250th of her Base Salary rate at her Termination Date) for Executive's services within 30 days of such services.
 
The Company may, at its discretion, purchase for its own benefit and at its own expense, key man life insurance on the life of Executive. Neither Executive nor Executive's spouse or dependents shall have any right, title, or interest in or to such insurance or the proceeds thereof. Executive agrees to cooperate with the life insurance company and the Company in the insurance underwriting process, including submitting to a physical examination and other tests necessary to secure coverage, and signing all appropriate applications and written forms as may be required by the insurance company.
 
 
If, during the Employment Term but not within a CIC Protected Period, (a) the Company terminates Executive's employment with the Company for any reason other than (x) Cause or (y) Executive's Total Disability or (b) Executive terminates her employment with the Company for Non-CIC Good Reason and, in either event such termination constitutes a Separation from Service, then Executive shall, subject to Section 2.05 and the other applicable provisions of this Section 4, be entitled to the following payments and benefits (the "") in lieu of any other payments or benefits available under Section 4.02 below:
Non-CIC Benefits
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of Sections 4.01(ii) (B) and (C), in determining whether to count the month in which the Non-CIC Severance Period ends, if the end of the Non-CIC Severance Period falls on a date on or before the 15th of a month, such month shall not be counted but, if the end of the Non-CIC Severance Period falls on a date after the 15th of a month, such month shall be counted.
This Section 4.01(ii) assumes that Performance Periods under the Incentive Plan are 12 months in length. To the extent that Performance Periods are greater or lesser than 12 months, the above payout schedule shall be appropriately adjusted by the Company, either by increasing or decreasing the number of Performance Periods in which severance payouts shall be made, such that (i) the final payment made to Executive under this Section 4.01(ii) shall be made at the time payouts are made for the Performance Period in which the Non-CIC Severance Period ends, and (ii) Executive shall receive no less than nor no greater than the amount, using concepts and formulas consistent with those provided in this Section 4.01(ii), that would have accrued and been payable to Executive under the Incentive Plan for the Non-CIC Severance Period had the Performance Periods remained 12 months in length.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.01(ii) to the contrary, each such payment shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of the Incentive Plan in the calendar year in which the Non-CIC Termination Period Incentive Payout or Capped Incentive Payout, as applicable, is determined, and in all events, not later than December 31
st
of the year in which each such payout is determined.
 
 
 
In all events, Executive's right to receive the Non-CIC Benefits shall cease immediately if Executive is re-employed by the Company or an affiliate of the Company or if Executive breaches the Restrictive Covenants. In all cases, the Company's rights under Section 5 shall continue.
 
If, during the Employment Term and within a CIC Protected Period, (a) the Company terminates Executive's employment with the Company for any reason other than (x) Cause or (y) Executive's Total Disability, or (b) Executive terminates her employment with the Company for CIC Good Reason and in either event, such termination constitutes a Separation from Service, then Executive shall, subject to Section 2.05 and the other applicable provisions of this Section 4, be entitled to the following payments and benefits (the "") in lieu of any other payments or benefits available under Section 4.01 above:
CIC Benefits
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of Sections 4.02(ii) (B) and (C), in determining whether to count the month in which the CIC Severance Period ends, if the end of the CIC Severance Period falls on a date on or before the 15th of a month, such month shall not be counted but, if the end of the CIC Severance Period falls on a date after the 15
th
of a month, such month shall be counted.
Notwithstanding the above and for the purpose of determining the payout amounts under Sections 4.02(ii)(B) and (C), to the extent that Executive terminates her employment because of CIC Good Reason and a reduction in Executive's Targeted Compensation has occurred which constitutes CIC Good Reason under Section 6.09(vi) of this Agreement, Executive's Final Targeted Compensation for purposes of Sections 4.02(ii)(B) and (C) shall be Executive's Targeted Compensation immediately prior to such Targeted Compensation reduction.
 
This Section 4.02(ii) assumes that Performance Periods under the Incentive Plan are 12 months in length. To the extent that Performance Periods are greater or lesser than 12 months, the above payout schedule shall be appropriately adjusted by the Company, either by increasing or decreasing the number of Performance Periods in which severance payouts shall be made, such that (i) the final payment made to Executive under this Section 4.02(ii) shall be made at the time payouts are made for the Performance Period in which the CIC Severance Period ends, and (ii) Executive shall receive no less than nor no greater than the amount, using concepts and formulas consistent with those provided in this Section 4.02(ii), that would have accrued and been payable to Executive under the Incentive Plan for the CIC Severance Period had the Performance Periods remained 12 months in length.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02(ii) to the contrary, each such payment shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of the Incentive Plan in the calendar year in which the CIC Termination Period Incentive Payout or Capped Incentive Payout, as applicable, is determined, and in all events, not later than December 31
st
of the year in which each such payout is determined.
 
 
 
In all events, Executive's right to receive the CIC Benefits shall cease immediately if Executive is re-employed by the Company or an affiliate of the Company or if Executive breaches any of the Restrictive Covenants. In all cases, the Company's rights under Section 5 shall continue.
 
 
In the event of any termination of employment resulting in payments under this Section 4, Executive need not seek other employment and, except as expressly provided herein, there shall be no offset against amounts due to Executive under this Agreement on account of any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that she may obtain.
 
The payments and benefits provided for hereunder shall be in full settlement and satisfaction of all of Executive's claims and demands relating to or arising out of Executive's employment with the Company or the termination thereof; provided, however, such settlement and release does not apply to (i) any rights or benefits as set forth in this Agreement and (ii) any rights to indemnification to which Executive is entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Kansas common or statutory law, or any other applicable indemnification agreements entered into between Executive and the Company. The Company's obligation to provide such payments and benefits is expressly made subject to and conditioned upon Executive executing a Release within the Release Consideration Period and delivering it to the Company with the Release Revocation Period expired without revocation.
Notwithstanding anything in the Release and Section 4.01 or 4.02 to the contrary, to the extent Executive has not executed the Release within the Release Consideration Period and delivered it to the Company, or has revoked the executed Release within the Release Revocation Period, as determined at the end of such Release Revocation Period, Executive will forfeit any right to receive the payments and benefits specified in Section 4.01 or 4.02.
 
Any amounts due under this Section 4 are in the nature of severance payments considered to be reasonable by the parties and are not in the nature of a penalty.
 
Subject to Section 2.05 and except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.03(d), Executive's rights under Section 4 shall be in lieu of any benefits that may be otherwise payable to or on behalf of Executive pursuant to the terms of the Severance Agreement or any other Company separation plans or policies or any other similar arrangement of the Company providing benefits upon termination of employment. If the Executive is a Participant in, and is entitled to severance benefits under, the CIC Severance Plan, severance compensation and benefits payable under Section 4.01 or 4.02 of this Agreement, as applicable, will be reduced dollar for dollar (but not below zero) by severance compensation and benefits payable to Executive under the CIC Severance Plan, if any, it being the intent that the Executive receive the greatest of the severance compensation and benefits under the CIC Severance Plan or this Agreement.
 
Executive consents to jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in and for Johnson County, Kansas, for all disputes arising under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any violation of Sections 3.02 through 3.07 (the ""). Executive acknowledges that the Company would be irreparably injured by a violation of the Restrictive Covenants, and she agrees that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it for any breach or threatened breach, shall be entitled to a preliminary or permanent injunction, temporary restraining order, or other equitable relief, restraining Executive from any actual or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants. If a bond is required to be posted in order for the Company to secure an injunction or other equitable remedy, the parties agree that the bond need not be more than a nominal sum. .

The parties intend the various provisions of this Agreement to be severable and to constitute independent and distinct binding obligations. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, in whole or in part, it shall not affect or impair the validity of any other provision or part of this Agreement, and the provision or part shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent required to permit enforcement. Upon such a determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the court or arbitrator, as applicable, shall have the authority to so modify the provision or term. If the provision or term is not modified by the court or arbitrator, the parties must negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the provisions of this Agreement are preserved to the greatest extent possible.
 
No waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by any other party, or of compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party, will operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the other party of any similar or dissimilar provisions and conditions at the same or any prior or subsequent time. The failure of either party to take any action by reason of such breach will not deprive the party of the right to take action at any time while the breach continues.

Upon the expiration or other termination of this Agreement, the respective rights and obligations of the parties shall survive the expiration or other termination to the extent necessary to carry out the intentions of the parties under this Agreement. In particular, without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any obligation of the Company to make payments or provide services under Section 4 shall continue beyond the end of the Employment Term and the obligations and covenants of Executive set forth in Section 3, and the rights and remedies of the Company with respect thereto, shall continue beyond the Employment Term to the extent contemplated therein.
