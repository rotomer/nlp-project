EXHIBIT INDEX Number Exhibit 99.1 Press Release Announcing Network Services Agreement with Ericsson

Exhibit 99.1 PRESS RELEASE [SPRINT LOGO] [ERICSSON LOGO] NOTE: Sprint and Ericsson will host a conference call for financial and industry analysts and press on Thursday, July 9 at 1:30 p.m. EDT (12:30 p.m. CDT) at 1-800-938-1120 (U.S. and Canada) or 1-706-634-7849 (International).

Sprint gains Network Advantage: Innovative network services deal with Ericsson delivers competitive edge Ericsson's world-class, day-to-day network services expertise allows Sprint to focus on delivering a superior customer experience, innovative services and popular new devices Sprint retains full ownership and control of its networks while continuing to drive all strategic decisions Sprint (NYSE:S) is breaking away from competitors today with a unique wireless and wireline network services agreement with global leader Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC). The seven-year agreement, matching Sprint's telecommunications leadership with Ericsson, enables Sprint and its millions of customers to enjoy a network services model that is proven successful worldwide and praised by business experts and communications analysts, as an operational best practice for network operators. Sprint's Steve Elfman, President of Network Operations and Wholesale, believes the historic deal, titled "Network Advantage," catapults the company to elite status in wireless and wireline network effectiveness.
"No other U.S.-based carrier has followed through on the business-enhancing vision inherent in Network Advantage. Our best-ever network performance will become even better by leveraging Ericsson's world-class leadership in network services, their proprietary tools, and the knowledge of more than 30,000 dedicated and highly-specialized service professionals to power Sprint's Now Network," said Elfman. The move delivers operational efficiencies for Sprint while further expanding Ericsson's network services business in North America. The agreement, with an option for renewal, will result in payments for services valued at between $4.5 billion and $5 billion (USD) over the seven-year term of the contract. The transaction calls for about 6,000 Sprint employees to begin performing their network functions as Ericsson employees sometime in the 3rd quarter. Key elements of Network Advantage are: o Sprint retains full ownership and control of its network assets, and solely owns network strategy and investment decisions. o Customers will continue to work directly with Sprint employees as their primary contact, as Sprint retains full control of the customer experience, customer technical support and services review. o Sprint retains technology and vendor selections. o Ericsson assumes responsibility for the day-to-day services, provisioning and maintenance for the Sprint-owned CDMA, iDEN and wireline networks. o Ericsson will optimize Sprint's multi-vendor inventory of assets such as spare parts and transmission equipment, and provide processes and tools for managing the national network platforms and operational support systems. o The transferred employees will become part of Ericsson Services Inc., a wholly-owned Ericsson subsidiary based in Overland Park, KS, a move that retains jobs in the United States. No force reductions are currently contemplated as a result of this agreement. "Ericsson is excited about the opportunity to expand our successful business model to the U.S. allowing Sprint to operate more efficiently while focusing even more on its customers," said Angel Ruiz, head of Ericsson's North American operations. "Managed Services has been successful throughout the world. Measures that provide operators with reduced cost and improved efficiency have become increasingly valid and attractive. This shows that the trend of full-scope Managed Services with tier-one global operators is now happening in the U.S. We're looking forward to the skill and competence that the Sprint employees will bring to Ericsson." Elfman added, "Taking advantage of Ericsson's global expertise to operate the tactical functions of our networks will greatly enhance Sprint's business. Beyond the obvious network advancements, we're now positioned to eclipse the competition by concentrating on our legacy of innovation - whether it's revolutionizing the customer experience as we've done with Ready Now and our value plans, or delivering iconic,
highly-sought-after products like Sprint Mobile Broadband Cards, the Palm(R) Pre(TM) and MiFi(TM). Further, our network powers Sprint's one-of-a-kind wireline and wireless assets, such as our award-wining Unified Communications enablement, a robust integration of converged solutions that delivers unparalleled business mobility." Sprint expects to immediately benefit from Ericsson's leadership and best-in-class economies of scale in network services. Ericsson was the pioneer with leading global carriers in Europe as well as AsiaPacific and Latin America (full reference list) for this type of partnership and has more than 15 years' experience in the field with hundreds of carrier contracts. Ericsson today manages networks that together serve more than 275 million subscribers worldwide. Additionally, more than 40 percent of all mobile traffic goes through Ericsson's networks. Its investments in best practices and tools will enhance Sprint's business and bring scale and efficiency that will impact Sprint beyond what it could achieve as a stand-alone carrier.
