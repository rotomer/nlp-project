Proposed Acquisition of iPCS, Inc.
     On October 18, 2009, Sprint Nextel Corporation ("Sprint"), iPCS, Inc. ("iPCS") and Ireland Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint, entered into a merger agreement, pursuant to which Sprint agreed to acquire iPCS for approximately $831 million, including the assumption of approximately $405 million of net debt.
     Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sprint will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of iPCS's outstanding common stock at a price of $24.00 per share. Following completion of the tender offer, any remaining shares of iPCS will be acquired in a cash merger at the same price. Upon completion of the merger, iPCS will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint.
     The board of directors of iPCS unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the offer and the merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the iPCS stockholders, (2) approved, authorized and declared advisable the merger agreement and approved and authorized the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and (3) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of iPCS accept the offer, tender their shares of iPCS stock pursuant to the offer and, to the extent applicable, adopt the merger agreement.
     The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for each of Sprint and iPCS and further provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, iPCS may be required to pay Sprint a termination fee of $12.5 million. The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed either late in the fourth quarter of 2009 or in early 2010. The foregoing description of the merger agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
     In connection with the merger agreement, Sprint and iPCS will seek an immediate stay of litigation pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division and the Illinois Appellate Court, including iPCS's request for an injunction to block the merger of Sprint and Virgin Mobile USA, Inc., with a final resolution of existing litigation between Sprint and iPCS to become effective upon the closing of the acquisition. As a result, Sprint will no longer be required to divest its iDEN network in certain iPCS territories and will terminate its previously announced divestiture process pending closing of the transaction. The foregoing description of the litigation resolution does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the settlement agreement and mutual release, which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
     On October 18, 2009, Sprint entered into a stockholders agreement with Apollo Investment Fund IV, L.P., Apollo Overseas Partners IV, L.P., Timothy M. Yager, Stebbins B. Chandor, Jr., Timothy G. Biltz and Mikal J. Thomsen, who collectively beneficially own or have the power to vote approximately 9.5 percent of the outstanding shares of iPCS common stock. Pursuant to the stockholders agreement, the stockholders agreed to tender their shares of iPCS common stock pursuant to the offer and vote their shares of iPCS common stock in favor of the merger, subject to the terms and conditions in the merger agreement. The foregoing description of the stockholders agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

     The Corporation shall indemnify, subject to the requirements of Section 5.4, any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.
Section 5.2. Derivative Suit Indemnity.
     To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or a person serving in any other enterprise at the request of the Corporation, has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 5.1 and 5.2 or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such director, officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
Section 5.3. Expense Indemnity.
     Any indemnification under Sections 5.1 and 5.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, or employee is proper in the circumstances because such director, officer, employee or agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Such determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by the stockholders.
Section 5.4. Procedure.
     Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
Section 5.5. Advances of Expenses.
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
Section 5.6. Non-Exclusive Rights.
 
otherwise, both as to action in a person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
     The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article.
     For purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
Section 5.8. Continuation of Indemnities.
     For purposes of this Article, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Section.
Section 5.9. Definition.
     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 5.10. Benefits.
     Whenever notice is required by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time required for such notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a
Section 6.1. Waiver of Notice.
 
person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.
     The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be the calendar year unless the Board of Directors shall from time to time otherwise prescribe.
Section 6.2. Fiscal Year.
     The corporate seal shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe, and the same may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

8. Contract.
 
concerning any other thing or matter, but are relying solely and exclusively upon their own knowledge, belief and judgment.
The Parties are aware that they may after the Signing Date discover claims or facts in addition to or different from those they now know or believe to be true with respect to Released Claims. Nevertheless, it is the intention of the Parties as of the Effectiveness Time to fully, finally and forever settle and release all Released Claims, including, without limitation, existing claims for damages and losses that are presently unknown or unanticipated. In furtherance of this intention, upon the Effectiveness Time, the releases given in this Agreement are and will remain in effect as full and complete mutual releases of Released Claims, notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any additional or different facts relative to them. Each Party assumes the risk of any mistake in executing this Agreement and furnishing the releases set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentences in this Section 9, each Party waives and relinquishes, to the extent permitted by law, any right or benefit that such Party has or might have under any provision of statutory or non-statutory law that might provide that a release does not extend to claims that a person does not know or suspect to exist at the time of execution of the release that, if known, would or might have materially affected the decision to give the release.

No failure or delay on the part of a Party to exercise any right it might have will prevent the exercise of that right by that Party at any time the other Party continues to be in default, and no such failure or delay will operate as a waiver of any default.
10. Waivers.
11. Other Provisions.

Sprint Nextel Corp. (NYSE: S) and iPCS, Inc. (NASDAQ: IPCS) today announced an agreement for Sprint Nextel to acquire iPCS for approximately $831 million, including the assumption of $405 million of net debt. This transaction value represents 6.4x projected 2010 Adjusted Earnings Before Income, Taxes, and Depreciation ("Adjusted EBITDA"*). Sprint expects to achieve approximately $30 million of synergies annually in the transaction and expects the transaction to be free cash flow accretive to Sprint in 2010.
OVERLAND PARK, Kan. and SCHAUMBURG, Ill.,  Oct. 19, 2009 
Under the terms of the agreement, Sprint Nextel will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of iPCS' outstanding common shares for $24.00 per share. This price per share represents a 34 percent premium to iPCS' closing stock price as of October 16, 2009. The agreement also requires a minimum of a majority of the shares outstanding (on a fully-diluted basis) to be tendered in the offer. Following completion of the tender offer, any remaining shares of iPCS will be acquired in a cash merger at the same price per share. Shareholders with approximately 9.5 percent of the outstanding common shares of iPCS have already agreed to tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer and to vote their shares in favor of the merger.
The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed either late in the fourth quarter of 2009 or early 2010. As part of the agreement, Sprint Nextel and iPCS will seek
 
an immediate stay of all pending litigation between the parties with a final resolution to become effective upon closing of the acquisition.
As a result, Sprint will no longer be required to divest its iDEN network in certain iPCS territories and will terminate its previously announced divestiture process pending closing of the transaction.
iPCS's services are sold under the Sprint brand name and in Sprint-branded stores. Because of the nearly seamless marketing and sales relationship between Sprint and iPCS, customers should not experience any change in their service as a result of this transaction.
"Acquiring iPCS brings added value to Sprint by expanding our direct customer base, growing our direct coverage area and simplifying our business operations," said Dan Hesse, CEO of Sprint Nextel. "Customers in iPCS territory will see a seamless transition and continue to enjoy a superb customer experience."
"We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with Sprint Nextel. Given the increasingly competitive landscape, we believe this is an opportune time to provide our shareholders with a liquidity event at a very attractive price. iPCS shareholders will receive a significant and immediate premium for their shares and our customers will continue to receive the same excellent service from the same dedicated people who provide that service today," said Timothy M. Yager, president and CEO of iPCS. "We look forward to working with the Sprint Nextel team to ensure a smooth completion of the transaction and transition in the coming months."
