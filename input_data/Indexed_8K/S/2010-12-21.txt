Mr. Euteneuer will assume his position with Sprint subsequent to the closing of the Merger.  Sprint reserves the right to rescind the offer on or after March 31, 2011.  The term of our current Chief Financial Officer, Robert H. Brust, runs through May 1, 2011 and we would like Mr. Brust to assist his successor with the orderly t ransition of responsibilities. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Mr. Euteneuer has been serving since September 12, 2008 as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Qwest, a telecommunications carrier providing local and long distance voice, data and internet wireline services as well as wireless and digital television services through certain partnerships. Previously, Mr. Euteneuer served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., a satellite radio provider, from 2002 until September 2008 after it merged with SIRIUS Satellite Radio, Inc. Prior to joining XM, Mr. Euteneuer held various management positions at Comcast Corporation and its subsidiary, Broadnet Europe.  On December 20, 2010, Sprint entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Euteneuer (the Agreement) with an initial term of 36 months from his hire date. The Agreement provides for the following annual compensation:
 
 
 
 
The Agreement states that Sprint will provide Mr. Euteneuer with the following sign-on compensation:
 
 
 
 
The Agreement provides that Mr. Euteneuers job location will be in Overland Park, Kansas and that he will relocate his primary residence to the area within nine months of his hire date under the standard officer relocation program, with certain exceptions including ineligibility for tax gross-up benefits.
 
Under the Agreement, in the event that Mr. Euteneuers employment is terminated by Sprint without cause (as defined in the Agreement), or Mr. Euteneuer terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the Agreement), other than in connection with a change in control of Sprint and subject to a release of claims:
 
 
 
 
 
Upon Mr. Euteneuers death, the restrictions with respect to any unvested portions of the Sign-On Restricted Stock Award will lapse.
 
In the event of Mr. Euteneuers termination of employment due to disability, he will continue to receive his base salary for 12 months (reduced by any amounts paid under Sprint's long-term disability plan), he will be entitled to continue to participate in certain benefit plans for such period, and the restrictions with respect to any unvested portion of the Sign-On Restricted Stock Award will lapse as of his termination date.
 
If, in connection with a change in control of Sprint, Mr. Euteneuers employment is terminated without cause or Mr. Euteneuer terminates his employment for good reason during the 18-month period following a change in control (subject to certain exceptions), subject to a release of claims, he is entitled to severance compensation in the form of a lump sum payment of two times his base salary and two times his annual short-term target opportunity as of the date of his termination of employment, to participate in certain benefit
 
 
 
 
plans during the Restricted Period and to the lapse as of his termination date of the restrictions with respect to any unvested portion of the Sign-On Restricted Stock Award.
 
 
Throughout his employment and through the Restricted Period, Mr. Euteneuer has agreed not to compete with Sprint (excludes activities related to Qwest and CenturyLink with respect to the Restricted Period) or solicit employees or customers of Sprint. If Mr. Euteneuer breaches any of these obligations, he would forfeit his right to any future severance payments and benefits to which he otherwise would be entitled.

(i)
 
all information, whether or not reduced to writing (or in a form from which information can be obtained, translated, or derived into reasonably usable form) or maintained in the mind or memory of the Executive and whether compiled or created by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any affiliates of the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the Company Group), which derives independent economic value from not being readily known to or ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of such information, of a proprietary, private, secret or confidential (including, without exception, inventions, products, processes, methods, techniques, formulas, compositions, compounds, projects, developments, sales strategies, plans, research data, clinical data, financial data, personnel data, computer programs, customer and supplier lists, trademarks, service marks, copyrights (whether registered or unregistered), artwork, and contacts at or knowledge of customers or prospective customers) nature concerning the Company Groups business, business relationships or financial affairs (collectively, Proprietary Information) shall be the exclusive property of the Company Group and shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 10, including, without limitation, Section 10(f);

the Proprietary Information of the Company Group gained by the Executive during the Executives association with the Company Group was or will be developed by and/or for the Company Group through substantial expenditure of time, effort and money and constitutes valuable and unique property of the Company Group;
 
(iii)
 
reasonable efforts have been put forth by the Company Group to maintain the secrecy of its Proprietary Information;
 
(iv)
 
such Proprietary Information is and will remain the sole property of the Company Group; and
 
(v)
 
any retention or use by the Executive of Proprietary Information after the termination of the Executives services for the Company Group, except as provided in Section 15 or as otherwise authorized by the Company, will constitute a misappropriation of the Company Groups Proprietary Information.
 
(b)
 
The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that he will take all affirmative steps reasonably necessary or required by the Company to protect the Proprietary Information from inappropriate disclosure during and after his employment with the Company.

(c)
 
The Executive further agrees that all files, letters, memoranda, reports, records, data, sketches, drawings, laboratory notebooks, program listings, or other written, photographic, electronic, or other tangible material containing or constituting Proprietary Information, whether created by the Executive or others, which shall come into his custody or possession, regardless of medium, shall be and are the exclusive property of the Company to be used by him only in the performance of his duties for the Company.

After such delivery, the Executive shall not retain any such materials or portions or copies thereof or any such tangible things and other property and shall execute any statements or affirmations of compliance under oath that the Company may require.
 
(d)
 
The Executive further agrees that his obligation not to disclose or to use information and materials of the types set forth in Sections 10(a), 10(b) and 10(c) above, and his obligation to return materials and tangible property, set forth in Section 10(c) above, also extends to such types of information, materials and tangible property of customers of the Company Group, consultants for the Company Group, suppliers to the Company Group, or other third parties who may have disclosed or entrusted the same to the Company Group or to the Executive in the course of conducting business with the Company Group.
 
(e)
 
The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that he will continue to keep in strict confidence, and will not, directly or indirectly, at any time, disclose, furnish, disseminate, make available, use or suffer to be used in any manner any Proprietary Information of the Company Group without limitation as to when or how the Executive may have acquired such Proprietary Information and that he will not disclose any Proprietary Information to any person or entity other than appropriate employees of the Company or use the same for any purposes (other than in the performance of his duties as an employee of the Company or as otherwise provided under this Agreement) without written approval of the Board, either during or after his emp loyment with the Company.
 
(f)
 
Further the Executive acknowledges that his obligation of confidentiality will survive, regardless of any other breach of this Agreement or any other agreement, by any party hereto, until and unless such Proprietary Information of the Company Group has become, through no fault of the Executive, generally known to the public.

(g)
 
The Executives obligations under this Section 10 are in addition to, and not in limitation of, all other obligations of confidentiality under the Companys policies, general legal or equitable principles or statutes.

nothing herein precludes honest and good faith reporting by the Executive to appropriate Company or legal enforcement authorities.
 
(i)
 
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that a violation of the foregoing provisions of this Section 10 would cause irreparable harm to the Company Group, and that the Companys remedy at law for any such violation would be inadequate.  In recognition of the foregoing, the Executive agrees that, in addition to any other relief afforded by law or this Agreement, including damages sustained by a breach of this Agreement and any forfeitures under Section 9(g), and without the necessity or proof of actual damages, the Company shall have the right to enforce this Agreement by specific remedies, which shall include, among other things, temporary and permanent injunctions, it being the understanding of the undersigned pa rties hereto that damages, the forfeitures described above and injunctions shall all be proper modes of relief and are not to be considered as alternative remedies.

(a)
 
The Executive covenants and agrees that the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, engage in any activities on behalf of or have an interest in any Competitor of the Company Group, whether as an owner, investor, executive, manager, employee, independent consultant, contractor, advisor, or otherwise.  The Executives ownership of less than one percent (1%) of any class of stock in a publicly traded corporation shall not be a breach of this paragraph.
 
(b)
 
A Competitor is any entity doing business directly or indirectly (e.g., as an owner, investor, provider of capital or otherwise) in the United States including any territory of the United States (the Territory) that provides products and/or services that are the same or similar to the products and/or services that are currently being provided at the time of Executives termination or that were provided by the Company Group during the two-year period prior to the Executives termination of employment with the Company Group;  provided, however, that during the Restricted Period neither CenturyLink, Inc. (CenturyLink) nor Qwest Communications International, Inc. (R 20;Qwest), either as a combined entity or, should the foregoing companies separate, separate entities, shall be considered a Competitor.
 
(c)
 
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that due to the continually evolving nature of the Company Groups industry, the scope of its business and/or the identities of Competitors may change over time.

(d)
 
The Executive covenants and agrees that should a court at any time determine that any restriction or limitation in this Section 11 is unreasonable or unenforceable, it will be deemed amended so as to provide the maximum protection to the Company Group and be deemed reasonable and enforceable by the court.
 
12.
 
.  In consideration of the Company entering into this Agreement, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Executive hereby covenants and agrees that he shall not, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person or entity do or suffer any of the following without the Companys consent:

(b)
 
induce any person who is an employee, officer or agent of the Company Group, or any of its affiliated, related or subsidiary entities to terminate such relationship;

(c)
 
solicit any customer of the Company Group, or any person or entity whose business the Company Group had solicited during the 180-day period prior to termination of the Executives employment for purposes of business which is competitive to the Company Group within the Territory; or
 
(d)
 
solicit, aid, induce, persuade or attempt to solicit, aid, induce or persuade any person or entity to take any action that would result in a Change in Control of the Company or to seek to control the Board in a material manner, except in the course of the performance of Executives duties as described in this Agreement or as expressly authorized by the Board, a committee of the Board or the CEO.
 
(e)
 
For purposes of this Section 12, the term solicit or persuade includes, but is not limited to, (i) initiating communications with an employee of the Company Group relating to possible employment, (ii) offering bonuses or additional compensation to encourage an employee of the Company Group to terminate his employment, (iii) referring employees of the Company Group to personnel or agents employed by competitors, suppliers or customers of the Company Group, and (iv) initiating communications with any person or entity relating to a possible Change in Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be prohibited under this Section 12:  (i) placement of a job advertisement in a publ ication of general circulation, in a trade publication, or on a job search website;  (ii) use of a job recruiter whose solicitation efforts are not targeted at employees of the Company Group; or (iii) any similar means of general advertising or solicitation that is not targeted at employees of the Company Group.
 
13.
 
Developments.
 
(a)
 
The Executive acknowledges and agrees that he will make full and prompt disclosure to the Company of all inventions, improvements, discoveries, methods, developments, software, mask works, and works of authorship, whether patentable or copyrightable or not, (i) which relate to the Companys business and have heretofore been created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive or under his direction or jointly with others, prior to his employment with the Company, and which have not been assigned to prior employers, or (ii)  which have utility in or relate to the Companys business and are created, made, conceived or reduced to practice by the Executive or under his direction or jointly with oth ers during his employment with the Company, whether or not during normal working hours or on the premises of the Company (all of the foregoing of which are collectively referred to in this Agreement as Developments).
 
(b)
 
The Executive further agrees to assign and does hereby assign to the Company (or any person or entity designated by the Company) all of the Executives rights, title and interest worldwide in and to all Developments and all related patents, patent applications, copyrights and copyright applications, and any other applications for registration of a proprietary right.  This Section 13(b) shall not apply to Developments that the Executive developed entirely on his own time without using the Companys equipment, supplies, facilities, or Proprietary Information and that does not, at the time of
 
 
Euteneuer Employment Agreement  Page 14 of 33
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
 
conception or reduction to practice, have utility in or relate to the Companys business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development.  The Executive understands that, to the extent this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of any Territory which precludes a requirement in an employee agreement to assign certain classes of inventions made by an employee, this Section 13(b) shall be interpreted not to apply to any invention which a court rules or the Company agrees falls within such classes.
 
(c)
 
The Executive further agrees to cooperate fully with the Company, both during and after his employment with the Company, with respect to the procurement, maintenance and enforcement of copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights (both in the United States and other countries) relating to Developments.  The Executive shall not be required to incur or pay any costs or expenses in connection with the rendering of such cooperation.  The Executive will sign all papers, including, without limitation, copyright applications, patent applications, declarations, oaths, formal assignments, assignments of priority rights, and powers of attorney, and do all things that the Company may reasonably deem neces sary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development.
 
(d)
 
The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that if the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure the Executives signature on any such papers, any executive officer of the Company shall be entitled to execute any such papers as the Executives agent and attorney-in-fact, and the Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each executive officer of the Company as his agent and attorney-in-fact to execute any such papers on the Executives behalf, and to take any and all actions as the Company may deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in any Development, under the conditions described in this sentence.
 
Remedies.  The Executive and the Company agree that the covenants contained in Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 are reasonable under the circumstances, and further agree that if in the opinion of any court of competent jurisdiction any such covenant is not reasonable in any respect, such court will have the right, power and authority to sever or modify any provision or provisions of such covenants as to the court will appear not reasonable and to enforce the remainder of the covenants as so amended.  The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach of any of the Executives obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being me asured in monetary terms.  Accordingly, the Executive acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law, in equity or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of the Executives violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage.  Without limiting the applicability of this Section 14 or in any way affecting the right of the Company to seek equitable remedies hereunder, in the event that the Executive breaches any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or 13 or engages in any activity that would constitute a breach save for the Executives action being in a state where any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12, 13 or this Section 14 is not enforceable as a matter of law, then the Companys obligation to pay any

remaining severance compensation and benefits that has not already been paid to Executive pursuant to Section 9 shall be terminated.
 
14.
 
Continued Availability and Cooperation.
 
(a)

Cooperation will include, but is not limited to:
 
(i)
 
making himself reasonably available for interviews and discussions with the Companys counsel as well as for depositions and trial testimony;
 
(ii)
 
if depositions or trial testimony are to occur, making himself reasonably available and cooperating in the preparation therefore, as and to the extent that the Company or the Companys counsel reasonably requests;

(iv)
 
cooperating fully in the development and presentation of the Companys prosecution or defense of such litigation or administrative proceeding.
 
(b)

(a)
 
In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or breach thereof, either Party shall refer the dispute to binding arbitration, which shall be the exclusive forum for resolving such claims.  Such arbitration will be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS) pursuant to its Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures and governed by Kansas law.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by the Parties according to the rules of JAMS.  In the event that the Parties fail to agree on the selection of the arbitrator within 30 days after either Party s request for arbitration, the arbitrator will be chosen by JAMS.  The arbitration proceeding shall commence on a mutually agreeable date within 90 days after the request for arbitration, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, and in the location where the Executive worked during the six months immediately prior to the request for arbitration if that location is in Kansas or Virginia, and if not, the location will be Johnson County, Kansas, unless the Parties agree otherwise.

(b)
 
The Parties agree that each will bear their own costs and attorneys fees relating to the arbitration, provided, however, that nothing in this Section 16(b) shall be considered to affect the Executives right to be reimbursed by the Company for costs and attorneys fees under Section 24(d).

(d)
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim or controversy for injunctive or equitable relief contemplated by or allowed under applicable law pursuant to Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement will be subject to arbitration under this Section 16, but will instead be subject to determination in a court of competent jurisdiction in Kansas, which court shall apply Kansas law consistent with Section 21 of this Agreement, where either Party may seek injunctive or equitable relief.

No agreements (other than the agreements evidencing any grants of equity awards) or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.
