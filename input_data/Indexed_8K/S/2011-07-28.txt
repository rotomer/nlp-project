SPRINT NEXTEL REPORTS
SECOND QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
Third consecutive quarter of adding more than
1 million total net new wireless subscribers
The company's second quarter 2011 earnings conference call will be held at 8 a.m. EDT today. Participants may dial 800-938-1120 in the U.S. or Canada (706-634-7849 internationally) and provide the following ID: 78540006 or may listen via the Internet at www.sprint.com/investor.
OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - July 28, 2011 - Sprint Nextel Corp. (NYSE: S)
today reported that during the second quarter of 2011, the company added nearly 1.1 million total net wireless subscribers primarily driven by net prepaid subscriber additions of 674,000, net wholesale and affiliate subscriber additions of 519,000 and net postpaid subscriber additions of 275,000 for the Sprint brand. The company achieved its best ever postpaid churn of 1.75 percent and the lowest prepaid churn in almost six years at 4.14 percent.
Sprint reported second quarter consolidated net operating revenues of $8.3 billion, operating income of $79 million and Adjusted OIBDA* of $1.3 billion. Additionally, the company reported a net loss of $847 million and a diluted loss per share of 28 cents for the quarter, which includes $588 million in equity losses of unconsolidated investments and other ($.20 per share net of tax, which includes the effect of increased valuation allowance of $209 million) and a $52 million charge ($.02 per share, which includes approximately $19 million of related increase in valuation allowance) to tax expense related to recently enacted state law changes in the state of Michigan. Sprint generated $267 million of Free Cash Flow* in the quarter. As of June 30, 2011, the company's total liquidity was $5.2 billion, which consists of $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and $900 million of borrowing capacity available under its revolving bank credit facility. The company's next scheduled debt maturities of $2.3 billion are due in March 2012.
Sprint's second quarter results, including our fourteenth consecutive quarter of improved customer care satisfaction, our best ever postpaid churn, more than 1 million net wireless subscriber additions and wireless service revenue growth, validate that our focus on providing simplicity, value and an unmatched customer experience is working, said Dan Hesse, Sprint CEO.

During the second quarter, independent organizations continued to reinforce Sprint's leadership with numerous recognitions and awards. Sprint was unbeaten among major wireless carriers for customer satisfaction according to results from the
2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index
. In addition to tying for first place among major wireless carriers, Sprint was also the most improved company in customer satisfaction, across all industries, over the last three years according to the survey. Frost & Sullivan gave Sprint its 2011 North American Wireless Consumers' Choice for Customer Value Enhancement Award. Sprint was recognized as Best-in-Class among North American Business Connectivity and Wireless Providers by research firm ATLANTIC-ACM in 11 different categories including Wireless Sales Reps, Provisioning, Billing and Customer Service. For the second consecutive year, Sprint received the Sustainability Leadership Award at the International Electronics Recycling Conference and Expo.
Sprint further strengthened its award-winning device portfolio by launching or announcing several innovative products and services during the quarter. Sprint launched three more 4G devices, HTC EVO View 4G, HTC EVO 3D and Nexus S 4G from Google. In addition, Sprint announced the coming availability of the first international 4G smartphone, Motorola PHOTON 4G later this month. Since launching 4G in 2008, Sprint has introduced or announced 24 4G-capable devices, more than any other U.S. carrier. Sprint's current 4G device portfolio includes five smartphones, a tablet and numerous USB modems, hotspots and routers.
Sprint also launched several other cutting-edge devices, including Motorola XPRT, Sprint's first Android smartphone to deliver enterprise-class security, personal productivity enhancements and international roaming. Also launched were the award-winning Kyocera Echo, the nation's first dual-touchscreen Android smartphone, and Samsung Galaxy Prevail, the first CDMA Android device on Boost Mobile. Sprint also launched its fourth green device and first eco-friendly Android smartphone, the award-winning Samsung Replenish. Upcoming launches include Motorola TRIUMPH, the
first Motorola Android smartphone for Virgin Mobile, and Motorola Titanium, the first Nextel Direct Connect
smartphone built on Android 2.1.
Demonstrating Sprint's open and innovative approach, in April the company launched Google Voice integrated with Sprint for CDMA phones. Sprint also announced that it will partner with Google to launch Google Wallet, an application using near field communication technology to enable smartphones (beginning with Nexus S) to make purchases at select merchants. Additionally, last week Sprint announced an agreement that will give Sprint customers easy access to Serve
SM
, American Express' recently launched digital payments platform. Sprint also launched 12 more Sprint ID packs, a service that downloads apps, widgets, wallpapers, ringtones and other content related to a person's interest at the push of a button. New Sprint ID packs include the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series ID pack, E! ID Pack and
a Green ID pack.
Also in the quarter, Sprint launched several business market initiatives including the Sprint Command Center, a centralized, secure, self-service laboratory for businesses to develop next-generation machine-to-machine (M2M) solutions and the 4G Enterprise WAN - a fixed wireless access solution that provides speed, reliability and secure wireless connectivity to the Sprint Global MPLS network. In addition, last week Sprint unveiled Business Freedom, a ground-breaking set of plans providing businesses the benefits of affordable data and voice plans without the long-term contracts.
 
Finally, the spectrum hosting agreement announced today with LightSquared demonstrates the growth opportunities made possible through Network Vision. Through spectrum hosting, Sprint can offer carriers and wireless providers the opportunity to more cost-effectively serve their customers by operating on Sprint's nationwide network infrastructure versus building their own network facilities. Network Vision is an innovative approach to network management and utilization that enables products and services that operate across multiple spectrum bands, or airwaves, to operate through a single multi-modal base station and allows Sprint to more efficiently deliver innovative network capabilities today and into the future. Through Network Vision, Sprint can take advantage of new technology, chipsets and CDMA, CDMA-WiMax and CDMA-LTE devices that operate in any of the 800 MHz and 1.9 GHz bands operated by Sprint, along with the 2.5 GHz band operated by Clearwire that offers WiMax 4G service and LightSquared's 1.6 GHz spectrum that will offer 4G LTE service. Through the implementation of Network Vision, Sprint expects to improve its cost structure through lower roaming expenses, backhaul savings and economies of scale and provide added flexibility in how Sprint meets data and voice capacity demands in the future.

*FINANCIAL MEASURES
Sprint Nextel provides financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and adjusted GAAP (non-GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect industry conventions, or standard measures of liquidity, profitability or performance commonly used by the investment community for comparability purposes. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have defined below each of the non-GAAP measures we use, but these measures may not be synonymous to similar measurement terms used by other companies.
Sprint Nextel provides reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures in its financial reporting. Because Sprint Nextel does not predict special items that might occur in the future, and our forecasts are developed at a level of detail different than that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures, Sprint Nextel does not provide reconciliations to GAAP of its forward-looking financial measures.
The measures used in this release include the following:
OIBDA
is operating income/(loss) before depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted OIBDA
is
OIBDA
excluding severance, exit costs, and other special items.
Adjusted OIBDA Margin
represents Adjusted OIBDA divided by non-equipment net operating revenues for Wireless and Adjusted OIBDA divided by net operating revenues for Wireline. We believe that Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide useful information to investors because they are an indicator of the strength and performance of our ongoing business operations, including our ability to fund discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, spectrum acquisitions and other investments and our ability to incur and service debt. While depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under GAAP, these expenses primarily represent non-cash current period costs associated with the use of long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin are calculations commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare the periodic and future operating performance and value of companies within the telecommunications industry.
Free Cash Flow
is the cash provided by operating activities less the cash used in investing activities other than short-term investments and equity method investments during the period. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors, analysts and our management about the cash generated by our core operations after interest and dividends and our ability to fund scheduled debt maturities and other financing activities, including discretionary refinancing and retirement of debt and purchase or sale of investments.
Net Debt
is consolidated debt, including current maturities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and if any, restricted cash. We believe that Net Debt provides useful information to investors, analysts and credit rating agencies about the capacity of the company to reduce the debt load and improve its capital structure.

SAFE HARBOR
This news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. The statements in this news release regarding the business outlook, expected performance and forward-looking guidance, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. The words "estimate," "project," "forecast," "intend," "expect," "believe," "target," "providing guidance" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting management's judgment based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. With respect to these forward-looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, customer and network usage, customer growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic and regulatory environment.
Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include:

Sprint Nextel believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and speak only as of the date of this release. Sprint Nextel is not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this release. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release.
Clearwire's second quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. As a result, the amount reflected for Sprint's share of Clearwire's results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, is an estimate and, based upon the finalization of Clearwire's results, may need to be revised if our estimate materially differs from Clearwire's actual results. Changes in our estimate, if any, would affect the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire, net loss and basic and diluted loss per common share but would have no effect on Sprint's operating income, OIBDA*, Adjusted OIBDA* or consolidated statement of cash flows.
