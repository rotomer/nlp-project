The Notes will be offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to persons outside the United States under Regulation S.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
