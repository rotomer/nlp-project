Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
This current report on Form 8-K/A updates information provided on a Form 8-K, dated February 28, 2011, in which Sprint Nextel Corporation (the 
Company
) reported that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company established the performance objectives of the Company's 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan for officers and other eligible employees of the Company. For 2011, the first annual performance period, the Compensation Committee established the performance objectives as free cash flow (a measure that ensures that we meet our debt maturities and our planned capital expenditures), and net service revenue (a top line-measure that captures key underlying trends of our operations), weighted equally. The Compensation Committee retained the ability to change the objective for the second and third annual performance periods.
On February 22, 2012, the Compensation Committee established the second annual performance period objectives, weighted equally, as (1) free cash flow, (2) net service revenue, and (3) a measure of completion of our network upgrade, which we refer to as Network Vision (as determined by a number of completed cell sites).
