Item 3.03 Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders

(ii) a certificate representing any shares of Non-Voting Common Stock which were represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection with such conversion but which were not converted into shares of Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(g) The issuance of certificates representing shares of Series 1 Common Stock received upon conversion of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock will be made without charge to the holders of such shares for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and the related issuance of Series 1 Common Stock.

S.A.
G.C.C.
Sections 17-6003 and 17-6603 (or any successor provisions) stating that the reissuance of such shares is prohibited, identifying the shares and reciting their retirement, then the filing of such certificate shall have the effect of amending these Articles of Incorporation so as to reduce accordingly the number of authorized shares of Non-Voting Common Stock or if such retired shares constitute all of the authorized shares of such class, then the filing of such certificate shall have the effect of amending these Articles of Incorporation automatically so as to eliminate all references to such class of stock therefrom.

aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, plus 2,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in cash, based upon the fair market value at the time the non-cash dividend or other distribution is declared as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared (but not withdrawn) on the Series 1 Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of the Sixth Series.
 
(ii) In the event the Corporation shall (A) declare any dividend on Series 1 Common Stock payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock or (C) combine the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the per share amount to which holders of shares of the Sixth Series would be entitled immediately before such event under clause (B) of paragraph (i) of this Section 10.6(b) shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before such event.
 
(iii) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Sixth Series as provided above in paragraph (i) of this Section 10.6(b) immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Series 1 Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock);

In the event the Corporation shall (i) declare any dividend on Series 1 Common Stock payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of the Sixth Series would be entitled immediately before such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before such event. Except as otherwise provided in these Articles of Incorporation, in any Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or otherwise required by law, the holders of the shares of the Sixth Series and the holders of Voting Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(d)
Certain Restrictions.
16
 
(i) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the shares of the Sixth Series as provided in Section 10.6(b) are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of the Sixth Series outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
(A) declare or pay dividends (except a dividend payable in Corporation Common Stock and/or any other Junior Stock) on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Junior Stock;
 
(B) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distribution on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the shares of the Sixth Series, except dividends paid ratably on the shares of the Sixth Series and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
 
(C) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) with the shares of the Sixth Series,
provided
that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of such parity stock in exchange for shares of Junior Stock; or
 
(D) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the Sixth Series, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) with the shares of the Sixth Series, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
 
(ii) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 10.6(d), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
(e)
Reacquired Shares
. Any shares of the Sixth Series purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth in this Section 10.6, elsewhere in the Articles of Incorporation, in any other Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.
 
(f)
Liquidation, Dissolution Or Winding Up.
 
(i) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of the Sixth Series shall be entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of stock ranking junior (as to the amount payable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Sixth Series, the greater of (A) $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of distribution, whether or not earned or declared, or (B) an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 2,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Series 1 Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall (x) declare any dividend on Series 1 Common Stock payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock, (y) subdivide the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock or (z) combine the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of the Sixth Series would be entitled immediately before such event pursuant to clause (B) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before such event.
17
(ii) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of stock ranking on a parity (as to the amount payable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Sixth Series shall not receive any distributions except for distributions made ratably on the Sixth Series and all other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
 
(g)
Consolidation, Merger, Etc.
In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Series 1 Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of the Sixth Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 2,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Series 1 Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall (i) declare any dividend on Series 1 Common Stock payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of the Sixth Series would be entitled immediately before such event pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of the Sixth Series shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before such event.
 
(h)
Ranking.
The shares of the Sixth Series shall rank junior to all other series of the Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise. Nothing herein shall preclude the Board of Directors of the Corporation from creating any additional series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of the Sixth Series as to the payment of dividends or distribution of assets.
 
(i)
Fractional Shares
. Shares of the Sixth Series may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holders fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of shares of the Sixth Series.
 
Section 10.7.
Preferred Stock-Seventh Series Convertible.
 
(a)
Amount, Rank and Designation
. The shares to constitute the Seventh Series of Preferred Stock shall number 300,000 shares. The designation thereof shall be Preferred Stock-Seventh Series, Convertible (hereinafter Seventh Series). Shares of the Seventh Series shall rank junior as to dividends and upon liquidation to shares of any other Preferred Stock designated as senior to the Seventh Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up (Senior Stock), and shall have a preference over the shares of the Corporation Common Stock and any other class or series of Junior Stock.
 
(b)
Dividends
. Holders of record of shares of the Seventh Series will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends (Preferred Dividends) payable at the rate of $6.73 per share quarterly in arrears on each September 30, December 31, March 31 and June 30 (each a Dividend Payment Date) or, if any such date is not a Business Day, the Preferred Dividends due on such Dividend Payment Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day. Preferred Dividends on the Seventh Series shall be cumulative and shall accumulate from the date of original issuance of the Seventh Series. Preferred Dividends shall be payable to holders of record as they appear on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, net of any amounts required to be withheld for or with respect to taxes, on such record dates, not more than 60 days preceding the payment date thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. Preferred Dividends payable on the Seventh Series for any period less than a full quarterly dividend period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual number of days elapsed in any period less than one month. Preferred Dividends shall accrue on a daily basis whether or not there are funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not such Preferred Dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid Preferred Dividends shall accumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable, but no interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid Preferred Dividends. Before any dividends on the Corporation Common Stock or any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Seventh Series as to dividends shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment, the holders
18
of shares of the Seventh Series shall be entitled to receive the full accumulated cash dividends for all quarterly dividend periods ending on or before the date on which any dividend on any such class or series of stock ranking junior to the Seventh Series as to dividends is declared or is to be paid.
 
(c)
Conversion.
 
(i) Each holder of shares of Seventh Series may at such holders option at any time convert any or all of such holders shares of Seventh Series into (A) if such holder is a Cable Holder, shares of Series 2 Common Stock, and (B) if such holder is not a Cable Holder, shares of Series 1 Common Stock. All references herein to shares of Series 2 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Seventh Series shall be deemed to refer to shares of Series 1 Common Stock if the holder of such Seventh Series is not a Cable Holder. Such shares of Seventh Series shall be convertible into a number of fully paid and nonassessable whole shares of Series 2 Common Stock as is equal to the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series surrendered for conversion divided by the Initial Conversion Price (as adjusted from time to time, the Conversion Price). In case of the redemption of any shares of the Seventh Series, such right of conversion shall cease and terminate as to the shares duly called for redemption at the close of business on the date fixed for redemption, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. If the Corporation defaults with respect to such payment, the right to convert the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the business day next preceding the date that such default is cured. Upon conversion the Corporation shall make no payment or adjustment on account of dividends accrued or in arrears on the Seventh Series surrendered for conversion.
 
(ii) Holders of shares of Seventh Series at the close of business on a record date for any payment of declared Preferred Dividends shall be entitled to receive the Preferred Dividends payable on those shares of Seventh Series on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion pursuant to this section of those shares of Seventh Series following such record date and before the close of business on such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, upon any conversion of shares of Seventh Series, the Corporation shall make no payment of or allowance of unpaid Preferred Dividends, whether or not in arrears, on such shares of Seventh Series, or for previously declared dividends or distributions on the shares of Series 2 Common Stock issued upon conversion.
 
(iii) Conversion of shares of Seventh Series may be effected by delivering certificates evidencing such shares of Seventh Series, together with written notice of conversion stating the number of shares to be converted and a proper assignment of such certificates to the Corporation or in blank, to the office of the transfer agent for the Seventh Series or to any other office or agency maintained by the Corporation for that purpose and otherwise in accordance with conversion procedures established by the Corporation. Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately before the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied. The Corporation shall as promptly as practicable after any conversion pursuant to this section issue and deliver to the converting holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of whole shares of Series 2 Common Stock into which such shares of Seventh Series were converted. Upon conversion of less than the entire number of the shares of Seventh Series represented by any certificate, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the converting holder a new certificate representing the number of shares of Seventh Series not converted. The Corporation shall effect such conversion as soon as practicable;
provided
that the Corporation shall not be required to convert shares of Seventh Series, and no surrender of shares of Seventh Series shall be effective for that purpose, while the stock transfer books of the Corporation for the Series 2 Common Stock are closed for any reason, but the surrender of shares of Seventh Series for conversion during any period while such books are so closed shall become effective for conversion immediately upon the reopening of such books, as if the conversion had been made on the date such shares of Seventh Series were surrendered, and at the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such surrender.
 
(iv) No fraction of a share of Series 2 Common Stock shall be issued upon any conversion. In lieu of the fraction of a share to which the holder of shares of the Seventh Series surrendered for conversion would otherwise be entitled, such holder shall receive, as soon as practicable after the date of conversion, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the market value of a full share of Series 1 Common Stock. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the market value of a share of Series 1 Common Stock shall be the Closing
19
Price of such a share on the day immediately preceding the date upon which such shares of Seventh Series are surrendered for conversion.
(v) The Conversion Price in effect at any time shall be subject to adjustment as follows:
 
(A) If the Corporation shall: (1) pay a dividend on the Voting Common Stock in shares of Voting Common Stock, (2) subdivide the outstanding shares of Voting Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (3) combine the outstanding shares of Voting Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, (4) pay a dividend on the Voting Common Stock in shares of its capital stock (other than Voting Common Stock) or (5) issue any shares of its capital stock by reclassification of the shares of Voting Common Stock (other than any reclassification by way of merger or binding share exchange that is subject to Section 10.7(c)(v)(H)), then the Conversion Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that if the holder elects to convert shares of Seventh Series after such time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number of shares of capital stock which, if such conversion had occurred immediately prior to such time, he would have owned upon such conversion and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. Subject to Section 10.7(c)(v)(F) for a dividend or distribution, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the dividend or distribution, and for a subdivision, combination or reclassification, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of the subdivision, combination or reclassification.
 
(B) If the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to the holders of the Voting Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Voting Common Stock (or Convertible Securities) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share, after adding thereto an allocable portion of the Conversion Price of the right or warrant to purchase such Convertible Securities, computed on the basis of the maximum number of shares of Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Securities) less than the Current Market Price per share on the Determination Date, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Voting Common Stock so offered (or the aggregate initial conversion price of the Convertible Securities so offered, after adding thereto the aggregate conversion price of the rights or warrants to purchase such Convertible Securities) to holders of Voting Common Stock (and to holders of Convertible Securities referred to in the following paragraph if the distribution to which this paragraph (B) applies is also being made to such holders) would purchase at such Current Market Price, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Voting Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the Convertible Securities so offered are initially convertible). The adjustment contemplated by this paragraph (B) shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the close of business on such record date;
provided
,
however
, to the extent that shares of Voting Common Stock (or Convertible Securities) have not been issued when such rights or warrants expire (or, in the case of rights or warrants to purchase Convertible Securities which have been exercised, if all of the shares of Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Securities have not been issued prior to the expiration of the conversion right thereof), the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of shares (or Convertible Securities) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants (or the conversion of such Convertible Securities).
 
For purposes of this paragraph (B) the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on any record date shall be deemed to include the maximum number of shares of Voting Common Stock the issuance of which would be necessary to effect the full exercise, exchange or conversion of all Convertible Securities outstanding on such record date which are then exercisable, exchangeable or convertible at a price (before giving effect to any adjustment to such price for the distribution to which this paragraph (B) is being applied) equal to or less than the Current Market Price per share of Voting Common Stock on the applicable Determination Date, if all of such
20
Convertible Securities were deemed to have been exercised, exchanged or converted immediately prior to the opening of business on such record date. In case any subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
(C) If the Corporation shall distribute to the holders of Voting Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets or subscription rights or warrants (excluding (x) dividends or distributions referred to in Section 10.7(c)(v)(A) and distributions of rights or warrants referred to in Section 10.7(c)(v)(B) and (y) cash dividends or other cash distributions, unless such cash dividends or cash distributions are Extraordinary Cash Dividends), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price on the Determination Date, less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) on such record date of the evidences of indebtedness, assets (including Extraordinary Cash Dividends), subscription rights or warrants to be distributed to the holders of Voting Common Stock (and to the holders of Convertible Securities referred to below if the distribution to which this paragraph (C) applies is also being made to such holders), and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date multiplied by such Current Market Price. For purposes of this paragraph (C), the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on any record date shall be deemed to include the maximum number of shares of Voting Common Stock the issuance of which would be necessary to effect the full exercise, exchange or conversion of all Convertible Securities outstanding on such record date which are then exercisable, exchangeable or convertible at a price (before giving effect to any adjustment to such price for the distribution to which this paragraph (C) is being applied) equal to or less than the Current Market Price per share of Voting Common Stock on the applicable Determination Date, if all of such Convertible Securities were deemed to have been exercised, exchanged or converted immediately prior to the opening of business on such record date.
 
For purposes of this paragraph (C), the term Extraordinary Cash Dividend shall mean any cash dividend with respect to the Voting Common Stock the amount of which, together with the aggregate amount of cash dividends on the Voting Common Stock to be aggregated with such cash dividend in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph, equals or exceeds the threshold percentage set forth below in the following sentence. If, upon the date prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to a cash dividend on the Voting Common Stock, the aggregate of the amount of such cash dividend together with the amounts of all cash dividends on the Voting Common Stock with Ex-Dividend Dates occurring in the 365 consecutive day period ending on the date prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to the cash dividend to which this provision is being applied (other than any such other cash dividends with Ex-Dividend Dates occurring in such period for which a prior adjustment to the Conversion Price was previously made under this paragraph (C)) equals or exceeds on a per share basis five percent (5%) of the average of the Closing Prices during the period beginning on the date after the first such Ex-Dividend Date in such period and ending on the date prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to the cash dividend to which this provision is being applied (except that if no other cash dividend has had an Ex-Dividend Date occurring in such period, the period for calculating the average of the Closing Prices shall be the period commencing 365 days prior to the date immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to the cash dividend to which this provision is being applied), such cash dividend together with each other cash dividend with an Ex-Dividend Date occurring in such 365-day period that is aggregated with such cash dividend in accordance with this paragraph shall be deemed to be an Extraordinary Cash Dividend.
 
The adjustment pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (C) shall be made successively whenever any distribution to which this paragraph (C) applies is made, and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution.
 
(D) If this Section 10.7(c)(v) requires adjustments to the Conversion Price under more than one of clause (4) of the first sentence of paragraph (A), paragraph (B) or paragraph (C), and the record dates for the distribution giving rise to such adjustments shall occur on the same date, then such adjustments shall be made by applying, first, the provisions of paragraph (A), second the provisions of paragraph (C) and, third, the provisions of paragraph (B).
21
 
(E) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) thereof;
provided, however
, that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (E) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 10.7(c)(v) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.
(F) In any case in which this Section 10.7(c)(v) shall require that an adjustment in the Conversion Price be made effective as of the record date for a specified event, the Corporation may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event (x) issuing to the holder of the Seventh Series the shares, if any, issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares, if any, issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the Conversion Price in effect prior to such adjustment, if the Seventh Series is converted after such record date, and (y) paying to the holder cash or its check in lieu of any fractional interest to which the holder would be entitled pursuant to Section 10.7(c)(iv);
provided
,
however
, that the Corporation shall deliver to the holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing the holders right to receive such additional shares and such cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
 
(G) If the Corporation consolidates with or merges into, or transfers (other than by mortgage or pledge) its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to, another Person or the Corporation is a party to a merger or binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Voting Common Stock, or the Voting Common Stock is converted into another class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the Corporation (or its successor in such transaction) or the transferee of such properties and assets shall make appropriate provision so that the holders certificate representing shares of Seventh Series shall thereafter be convertible, upon the terms and conditions specified in the certificates, for the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Voting Common Stock purchasable upon conversion of the holders Seventh Series immediately before the effective date of such transaction (assuming, to the extent applicable, that such holder of Voting Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election with respect thereto, and received per share the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets received per share of Voting Common Stock by a plurality of the nonelecting shares of Voting Common Stock); and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth in this Section 10.7(c)(v) with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holder of the Seventh Series shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any such other securities or assets thereafter deliverable on the conversion of the holders Seventh Series. The subdivision or combination of the Voting Common Stock at any time outstanding into a greater or lesser number of shares of Voting Common Stock shall not be deemed to be a reclassification of the Voting Common Stock for the purposes of this subsection. The Corporation shall not effect any such consolidation, merger, transfer or binding share exchange unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor (if other than the Corporation) resulting from such consolidation or merger or the Person purchasing such assets or other appropriate Person shall assume, by written instrument, the obligation to deliver to the holders of the Seventh Series such securities, cash or other assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder may be entitled to purchase and the other obligations in this Section 10.7.
 
The Corporation may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of this Section 10.7(c)(v), as it shall in its sole discretion determine to be advisable.
 
(H) Subject to Section 10.7(c)(v)(E) and to the remaining provisions of this Section 10.7(c)(v)(H), in the event that a holder of Seventh Series would be entitled to receive upon conversion thereof pursuant to this Section 10.7(c)(v) any Redeemable Capital Stock and the Corporation redeems, exchanges or otherwise acquires all of the outstanding shares or other units of such Redeemable Capital Stock (such event being a Redemption Event), then, from and after the effective date of such Redemption Event, the holders of shares of Seventh Series then outstanding shall be entitled to receive upon conversion of such shares, in lieu of shares or units of such Redeemable Capital Stock, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon the Redemption Event by a holder of the number of shares or units of such Redeemable Capital Stock into which such shares of Seventh Series could have been converted immediately prior to the effective date of such Redemption Event (assuming, to the extent applicable, that such holder failed to exercise any rights of election with respect thereto and received per share or unit of such Redeemable Capital Stock the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property received per share or unit by a
22
plurality of the non-electing shares or units of such Redeemable Capital Stock), and (from and after the effective date of such Redemption Event) the holders of the Seventh Series shall have no other conversion rights under these provisions with respect to such Redeemable Capital Stock.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the redemption price for the shares of such Redeemable Capital Stock is paid in whole or in part in Redemption Securities, and the Mirror Preferred Stock Condition is met, the Seventh Series shall not be convertible into such Redemption Securities and, from and after the applicable redemption date, the holders of any shares of Seventh Series that have not been exchanged for Mirror Preferred Stock and Exchange Preferred Stock shall have no conversion rights under these provisions except for any conversion right that may have existed immediately prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event with respect to any shares of stock (including the Voting Common Stock) or other securities or property other than the Redeemable Capital Stock so redeemed. The Corporation shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Mirror Preferred Stock Condition is satisfied. The Mirror Preferred Stock Condition will be satisfied in connection with a redemption of any Redeemable Capital Stock into which the Seventh Series is then convertible if appropriate provision is made so that the holders of the Seventh Series have the right to exchange their shares of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Redemption Event for Exchange Preferred Stock of the Corporation and Mirror Preferred Stock of the issuer of the Redemption Securities. The sum of the initial liquidation preferences of the shares of Exchange Preferred and Mirror Preferred Stock delivered in exchange for a share of Seventh Series will equal the Liquidation Preference of a share of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Redemption Event. The Mirror Preferred Stock will have an aggregate initial liquidation preference equal to the product of the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the quotient of (x) the product of the amount of shares of the Redeemable Capital Stock for which each share of Seventh Series is then convertible to be redeemed (determined immediately prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event) and the average of the daily Closing Prices of the Redeemable Capital Stock for the period of ten consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event, divided by (y) the sum of the amount determined pursuant to clause (x), plus the fair value of the shares of stock or other securities or property (other than the Redeemable Capital Stock being redeemed) that would have been receivable by a holder of Seventh Series upon conversion thereof immediately prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event (such fair value to be determined in the case of stock or other securities with a Closing Price in the same manner as provided in clause (x) and otherwise by the Board of Directors in the exercise of its judgment). The shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will have an aggregate initial liquidation preference equal to the difference between the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the aggregate initial liquidation preference of the Mirror Preferred Stock. No shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will be issued in exchange for the Seventh Series if the shares of Exchange Preferred Stock would have no Liquidation Preference as a result of the above formula.
 
(I) If the Corporation effects a Spin Off, the Corporation shall make appropriate provision so that the holders of the Seventh Series have the right to exchange their shares of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Spin Off for Exchange Preferred Stock of the Corporation and Mirror Preferred Stock of the issuer of the Spin Off Securities. The sum of the initial liquidation preference of the shares of Exchange Preferred Stock and Mirror Preferred Stock delivered in exchange for a share of Seventh Series will equal the Liquidation Preference of a share of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Spin Off. The Mirror Preferred Stock will have an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the product of the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the quotient of (x) the product of the number (or fraction) of Spin Off Securities that would have been receivable upon such Spin Off by a holder of the number of shares of Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Seventh Series immediately prior to the effective date of the Spin Off and the average of the daily Closing Prices of the Spin Off Securities for the period of ten consecutive trading days commencing on the tenth trading day following the effective date of the Spin Off, divided by (y) the sum of the amount determined pursuant to clause (x), plus the fair value of the shares of Voting Common Stock and other securities or property (other than Spin Off Securities) that would have been receivable by a holder of a share of Seventh Series in the Spin Off following conversion thereof immediately prior to the effective date of the Spin Off (such fair value to be determined in the case of Voting Common Stock or other securities with a Closing Price in the same manner as provided in clause (x) and otherwise by the Board of Directors in the exercise of its judgment). The shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will have an aggregate initial liquidation preference equal to the difference between the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the aggregate initial liquidation preference of the Mirror Preferred Stock. No shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will be issued in exchange for the
23
Seventh Series if the shares of Exchange Preferred Stock would have no Liquidation Preference as a result of the above formula. From and after the effective date of such Spin Off, the holders of any shares of Seventh Series that have not been exchanged for Mirror Preferred Stock and Exchange Preferred Stock as provided above shall have no conversion rights under these provisions with respect to such Spin Off Securities.
 
(vi) The Corporation shall pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Voting Common Stock on the conversion of Seventh Series;
provided
,
however
, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any registration of transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Voting Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of Seventh Series converted or to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.
 
(d)
Liquidation Rights
. Subject to prior payment of preferred amounts to which any Senior Stock is entitled, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation the holders of the Seventh Series will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders, before any distribution of the assets shall be made to the holders of the Corporation Common Stock or any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Seventh Series upon liquidation, the sum of U.S. $1,000 per share (the Liquidation Preference), plus in each case any accumulated unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), to the date of final distribution. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation the amounts payable with respect to the Seventh Series and any other Parity Stock are not paid in full, the holders of the Seventh Series and such Parity Stock will share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which they are entitled, the holders of Seventh Series shall not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the Corporation. A consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into one or more other corporations (whether or not the Corporation is the corporation surviving such consolidation or merger), or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation. Notice of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the Seventh Series, and shall be mailed to the holders of Seventh Series at their last addresses as they shall appear on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, at least 20 business days before any such action, stating the date on which any such action is expected to become effective. The failure to give or receive the notice required by this section or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
 
(e)
Redemption.
 
(i)
General
. The Corporation may at its option redeem the Seventh Series in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the Liquidation Preference per share of Seventh Series, plus any accumulated unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) up to but excluding such redemption date. If less than all the outstanding Seventh Series is to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata as nearly as practicable or by lot, or by such other method as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be equitable, without regard to whether the shares to be redeemed are convertible into Series 1 Common Stock or Series 2 Common Stock. Shares so redeemed shall be cancelled and upon such cancellation shall be deemed to be authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Corporation but shall not be reissued as shares of the same series.
 
(ii)
Mandatory Redemption
. To the extent permitted by law, the Corporation shall redeem, on November 23, 2008 (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day thereafter) (subject to extension as provided in the last sentence of this Section 10.7(e)(ii), the Mandatory Redemption Date), all remaining shares of Seventh Series then outstanding, at the redemption price of $1,000 for each share outstanding, plus an amount in cash equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the Mandatory Redemption Date. Prior to authorizing or making such redemption with respect to the Seventh Series, the Corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors shall, to the extent of funds legally available therefor, declare a dividend on the Seventh Series payable on the Mandatory Redemption Date in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Seventh Series as of such date and, if the Corporation does not have sufficient legally available funds to declare and pay all dividends accrued at the time of such redemption, any remaining accrued and unpaid
24
dividends shall be added to the redemption price. After paying any accrued and unpaid dividends pursuant to the foregoing sentence, if the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of the Seventh Series then required to be redeemed are insufficient to redeem the total number of such shares then outstanding, those funds which are legally available shall be used to redeem the maximum possible number of shares of the Seventh Series. At any time and from time to time thereafter, when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available to discharge its obligation to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Seventh Series required to be redeemed pursuant to this section (the Mandatory Redemption Obligation), such funds shall be immediately used to discharge such Mandatory Redemption Obligation until the balance of such shares have been redeemed. If and so long as the Mandatory Redemption Obligation shall not be fully discharged, (x) dividends on any remaining outstanding shares of Seventh Series shall continue to accrue and be added to the dividend payable pursuant to the third preceding sentence and
(y) the Corporation shall not declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on any Parity Stock or Junior Stock. With respect to any Exchange Preferred Stock or Mirror Preferred Stock, the Mandatory Redemption Date shall be the later to occur of (i) November 23, 2008, and (ii) the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance of such Exchange Preferred Stock or Mirror Preferred Stock.
 
(iii)
Notice
. The Corporation will provide notice of any redemption of shares of Seventh Series to holders of record of the Seventh Series to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption. Such notice shall be provided by first-class mail postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the Seventh Series to be redeemed, at such holders address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation. Each such mailed notice shall state, as appropriate, the following:
 
(A) the redemption date;
 
(B) the number of shares of Seventh Series to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;
 
(C) the redemption price;
 
(D) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for redemption;
 
(E) the amount of full cumulative dividends per share of Seventh Series to be redeemed accrued and unpaid up to but excluding such redemption date, and that dividends on shares of Seventh Series to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date unless the Corporation shall default in payment of the redemption price plus such full cumulative dividends accrued and unpaid thereon;
 
(F) the name and location of any bank or trust company with which the Corporation will deposit redemption funds pursuant to subsection (v) below;
 
(G) the then effective Conversion Price (as determined under Section 10.7(c)); and
 
(H) that the right of holders to convert shares of Seventh Series to be redeemed will terminate at the close of business on the date fixed for redemption (unless the Corporation shall default in the payment of the redemption price and such full cumulative dividends accrued and unpaid thereon).
 
Any notice that is mailed as set forth above shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of shares of Seventh Series receives such notice, and failure to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Seventh Series.
 
(iv)
Mechanics of Redemption
. Upon surrender in accordance with the aforesaid notice of the certificate for any shares so redeemed (duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer if so required by the Corporation), the holders of record of such shares shall be entitled to receive the redemption price, without interest, plus full cumulative dividends thereon accrued and unpaid up to but excluding such redemption date out of funds legally available therefor. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate representing the unredeemed shares shall be issued without cost to the holder thereof.
 
25
(v)
Redemption Funds
. On the date of any redemption being made pursuant to this section, the Corporation shall, and at any time after notice of such redemption shall have been mailed and before the date of redemption the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Seventh Series to be redeemed the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust company in the City of New York having a capital and surplus of at least $1 billion, with instructions to such bank or trust company to pay the full redemption amounts as provided herein to the holders of shares of Seventh Series upon surrender of certificates for such shares;
provided
,
however
, that the making of such deposit shall not release the Corporation from any of its obligations hereunder. Any moneys so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation and, upon demand, such bank or trust company shall pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of shares of Seventh Series so redeemed shall look only to the Corporation for the payment of the full redemption amounts, as provided herein.
 
(vi)
Rights After Redemption
. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, upon the deposit pursuant to subsection (v) of the full redemption amounts as provided herein in respect of all shares of Seventh Series then to be redeemed, notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been surrendered in accordance with subsection (iv), from and after the date of redemption designated in the notice of redemption: (A) the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (B) the rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue and (C) all rights of the holders of such shares of Seventh Series shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the full redemption amounts as provided herein without interest thereon. If the funds deposited are not sufficient for redemption of the shares of the Seventh Series that were to be redeemed, then no certificates evidencing such shares shall be deemed surrendered and such shares shall remain outstanding and the rights of holders of shares of Seventh Series shall continue to be those of holders of shares of the Seventh Series.
 
(vii)
Restrictions on Redemption and Purchase
. Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any quarterly dividend payable on the Seventh Series shall be in arrears and until all such dividends in arrears shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, the Corporation shall not redeem any shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock unless all outstanding shares of Seventh Series are simultaneously redeemed and shall not purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of Seventh Series or any Parity Stock or Junior Stock except (A) by conversion into or exchange for stock ranking junior as to dividends or (B) in accordance with a purchase or exchange offer made by the Corporation to all holders of record of Seventh Series and such Parity Stock upon the same terms as to holders of any series and, in the case of offers relating to more than one series, upon such terms as the Board of Directors or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any authorized committee thereof, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series of stock, determines will result in fair and equitable treatment as between such series, which determination shall be conclusive.

The full redemption price for such shares of the Ninth Series shall be payable in cash and/or Series 1 Common Stock, at the option of the Corporation, to the Person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the event that less than all of the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.
 
(C) On and after any Redemption Date,
provided
that the Corporation has made available at the office of the Transfer Agent a sufficient amount of cash or securities to effect the redemption, the Liquidation Preference will cease to accrete on the Ninth Series called for redemption, such shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares as Holders shall cease except the right to receive the cash and/or Series 1 Common Stock deliverable upon such redemption, without interest from the Redemption Date.
 
(f)
Voting Rights
. (i) Holders, except as otherwise required under Kansas law or as set forth below, shall not be entitled or permitted to vote on any matter required or permitted to be voted upon by the stockholders of the Corporation.

provided
that, solely in the case of Senior Securities issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to redeem or repurchase, less than all shares of the Ninth Series then outstanding, the aggregate liquidation preference of such Senior Securities shall not exceed the aggregate Liquidation Preference of, premium and accrued and unpaid dividends on, and expenses in connection with the refinancing of, the shares of the Ninth Series so exchanged, redeemed or repurchased.
 
32
(B) So long as any shares of the Ninth Series are outstanding, the Corporation shall not amend these Articles of Incorporation so as to affect adversely the specified rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of Holders, or to authorize the issuance of any additional shares of the Ninth Series, without the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Ninth Series, voting separately as one class, given in person or by proxy, by resolution adopted at an annual or special meeting.
 
(C) Except as set forth in subparagraph (f)(ii)(B) hereof, (1) the creation, authorization or issuance of any shares of any Junior Securities or Parity Securities, or (2) the increase or decrease in the amount of authorized capital stock of any class, including any Preferred Stock, shall not require the consent of the Holders and shall not, unless not complying with subparagraph (f)(ii)(B) hereof, be deemed to affect adversely the rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of the Holders.

Each event described in clauses (1) and (2) of this subparagraph (f)(iii)(A) is a Voting Rights Triggering Event.
 
(B) The right of the Holders voting separately as one class to elect two Directors as described in subparagraph (f)(iii)(A) shall continue until such time as (1) in the event such right arises due to failure by the Corporation to comply with its obligations set forth in paragraph (g), the Corporation remedies any such failure and (2) in the event such right arises due to a default by the Corporation in the payment of the Liquidation Preference of any share of the Ninth Series on the Mandatory Redemption Date, the Corporation remedies such default, at which time the term of any Directors elected pursuant to subparagraph (f)(iii)(A) hereof shall terminate and the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced to the number necessary to reflect the termination of the right of the Holders to elect Directors, subject always to the same provisions for the renewal and divestment of such special voting rights in the case of any future Voting Rights Triggering Event.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph (f)(iii)(B), no such special meeting shall be called if any such request is received less than 40 days before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. Any Holder so designated shall have, and the Corporation shall provide to such designated Holder, access to the lists of Holders for purposes of calling a meeting pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph (f)(iii)(B).
 
(C) At any meeting held for the purpose of electing Directors at which the Holders shall have the right, voting separately as one class, to elect Directors as aforesaid, the presence in person or by proxy of Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Ninth Series shall be required to constitute a quorum of the Ninth Series.
 
(D) Any vacancy occurring in the office of a Director elected by the Holders may be filled by the remaining Director elected by such Holders unless and until such vacancy shall be filled by such Holders.
 
(iv) In any case in which the Holders shall be entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (f) or pursuant to Kansas law, each Holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of the Ninth Series held. Any action
33
that may be taken hereunder by the Holders at a meeting may be taken by unanimous written consent of the Holders.
 
(g)
Change of Control
. (i) A Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred at such time after the Effective Date if there shall occur:
 
(x) the acquisition by any Person of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of transactions, of shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitling such Person to exercise 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in elections of Directors, other than any such acquisition by the Corporation, any subsidiary of the Corporation or any employee benefit plan of the Corporation; or

provided
,
however
, that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred if either (a) the closing price per share of the Series 1 Common Stock for any five Trading Days within the period of 10 consecutive Trading Days ending immediately after the later of the Change of Control or the public announcement of the Change of Control (in the case of a Change of Control under clause (x) above) or ending immediately before the Change of Control (in the case of a Change of Control under clause (y) above) shall equal or exceed 105% of the effective conversion price in effect on each such Trading Day (i.e., the Liquidation Preference on such Trading Day, divided by the Conversion Rate in effect on such Trading Day), or (b) all of the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares) in the transaction or transactions constituting the Change of Control consists of Common Shares (or equivalent securities) traded on a national or regional securities exchange or quoted on the NNM and as a result of such transaction or transactions the Ninth Series becomes convertible solely into such Common Shares (or equivalent securities).
 
Beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Commission under the Exchange Act.
 
(ii) Within 30 days after the occurrence of any Change of Control, the Corporation shall mail a notice (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to each Holder (the Change of Control Corporation Notice) with a copy to the Transfer Agent stating that a Change of Control has occurred and that a special tender right has arisen as a result thereof.
 
(iii) (A) If a Change of Control occurs, the Corporation shall be required to make an offer (a Change of Control Offer) to each Holder to acquire any or all of such Holders shares of the Ninth Series on a date (an Acquisition Date) that is not more than 45 days after the date of the Change of Control at a tender price equal to the Liquidation Preference thereof on the Acquisition Date. The Corporation may, at its option, in lieu of paying the tender price in cash, pay the tender price or a portion thereof in Series 1 Common Stock or in a combination of cash and Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(B) To exercise the special tender right set forth in subparagraph (g)(iii)(A), a Holder must deliver on or before the 30th day after the date of the Change of Control Corporation Notice written notice to the Transfer Agent of the Holders exercise of such right, together with, in the case of shares of the Ninth Series held in definitive form, the Ninth Series certificates with respect to which the right is being exercised. In the case of shares of the Ninth Series held in book entry form, the applicable procedures of the depositary for the shares of Ninth Series with respect to redemption of shares by an issuer will apply. Any such notice by the Holder
34
may be withdrawn by the Holder by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Transfer Agent prior to the close of business on the Acquisition Date. The notice of withdrawal shall state the number of shares of the Ninth Series and the certificate numbers of the Ninth Series certificates as to which the withdrawal notice relates and the number of shares, if any, which remain subject to the Holders notice of exercise.
 
(C) With respect to any Change of Control, the Change of Control Corporation Notice shall also specify (w) the tender price and the purchase date, which shall be 45 days after the date of the Change of Control Corporation Notice; (x) that the Liquidation Preference of any shares of the Ninth Series not tendered or converted will continue to accrete in accordance with the terms hereof; (y) that, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the tender price, the Liquidation Preference of all shares of the Ninth Series accepted for payment pursuant to this paragraph (g) shall cease to accrete on and after the Acquisition Date and all rights of the Holders accepted for payment shall terminate on and after the Acquisition Date and (z) a description of the procedures to be followed by such Holder in order to have its shares of the Ninth Series repurchased.
(D) On the Acquisition Date, the Corporation shall, to the extent lawful, (1) accept for payment shares of the Ninth Series tendered pursuant to this paragraph (g) and (2) promptly mail to each Holder of Ninth Series so accepted payment in an amount equal to the tender price for such shares and, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment for the shares of the Ninth Series tendered pursuant to this paragraph (g), the Liquidation Preference shall cease to accrete with respect to the shares of the Ninth Series tendered and all rights of Holders of such tendered shares shall terminate, except for the right to receive payment therefor, on the Acquisition Date. The Corporation shall publicly announce the results of its Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Acquisition Date.
 
(iv) (A) The Corporation shall comply with Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act and any securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable to the repurchase of shares of the Ninth Series in connection with a Change of Control.
 
(B) In the event the Corporation elects to pay all or a portion of the tender price in Series 1 Common Stock, upon determination of the actual number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock to be paid in lieu of cash in accordance with paragraph (h), the Corporation will publicly announce such determination and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission containing the information in such public announcement.
 
(C) If the Transfer Agent holds money or securities sufficient to pay the tender price on the Business Day following the Acquisition Date, then, on and after the Acquisition Date, each share of the Ninth Series tendered to the Corporation will cease to be outstanding and the Liquidation Preference thereon shall cease to accrete whether or not book-entry transfer of such Ninth Series is made or such Ninth Series is delivered to the Transfer Agent, and all other rights of the Holder thereof shall terminate (other than the right to receive the tender price, without interest, upon book-entry transfer or delivery of the Ninth Series certificate).
 
(D) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (g), the Corporation shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this paragraph (g) applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Corporation and purchases all shares of the Ninth Series validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to this paragraph (g).
 
(h)
Payments in Series 1 Common Stock
. (i) If the Corporation elects to pay any redemption price or tender price, in whole or in part, in Series 1 Common Stock, the number of shares to be delivered in respect of the portion of such redemption price or tender price to be paid in Series 1 Common Stock shall be equal to such portion of the redemption price or tender price divided by the Market Price of the Series 1 Common Stock. No fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock will be delivered upon any acquisition of Ninth Series by the Corporation through the delivery of Series 1 Common Stock in payment, in whole or in part, of the redemption price or tender price. Instead, the Corporation, at its option, will either round up to full shares or pay cash based on the Market Price for all fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock. The Corporation may elect to pay the redemption price or tender price in Series 1 Common Stock only if the Series 1 Common Stock is listed on a United States national or regional stock exchange or quoted by the NNM.
 
35
(ii) At least 23 Trading Days prior to any Redemption Date or Acquisition Date, the Corporation must give notice (a Corporation Notice) to the Holders of its intention to pay the redemption price or tender price, or any portion thereof, in Series 1 Common Stock (specifying the percentage thereof). Upon determination of the actual number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Corporation will publicly announce such determination and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission containing the information in such public announcement.
 
(iii) The Corporations right to pay the redemption price or tender price (or a portion thereof) in Series 1 Common Stock is subject to: (1) the delivery by the Corporation of a timely Corporation Notice of its election to purchase all or a specified percentage of the Ninth Series with Series 1 Common Stock as provided herein; (2) the registration of resales of the Series 1 Common Stock under the Securities Act, if required for the Series 1 Common Stock to be freely tradeable (assuming the Holder thereof is not an Affiliate of the Corporation); (3) the issuance of such Series 1 Common Stock being in compliance with other applicable federal and state securities laws, if any; and (4) the receipt by the Transfer Agent of an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel each stating that (A) the terms of the issuance of the Series 1 Common Stock are in conformity with the terms hereof and (B) the shares of Series 1 Common Stock to be issued by the Corporation in payment of the specified percentage of the tender price or redemption price have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered pursuant to the terms hereof in payment of the tender price or redemption price, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and, in the case of such officers certificate, stating that conditions (1), (2) and (3) above have been satisfied (and setting forth the Sale Price of a share of Series 1 Common Stock on each Trading Day during the period during which the Market Price is calculated and ending on the Acquisition Date or Redemption Date as applicable) and, in the case of such opinion of counsel, stating that conditions (2) and (3) above have been satisfied.
 
If such conditions are not satisfied by the applicable Acquisition Date or Redemption Date, the Corporation will pay the tender price or redemption price on such Acquisition Date or Redemption Date entirely in cash (except as provided in paragraph (g)).
 
(i)
Conversion
. (i) A Holder may convert its shares of the Ninth Series into Series 1 Common Stock and cash (as provided below), unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at any time prior to the close of business on December 23, 2013;
provided
that if a share of the Ninth Series is called for redemption, the Holder may convert it only until the close of business on the applicable Redemption Date unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price. Shares of the Ninth Series which a Holder has tendered for acquisition by the Corporation or, as described in paragraph (g), a third party acquiror pursuant to an offer to acquire, may be converted only if such Ninth Series is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of such offer.
 
Each share of the Ninth Series will initially be convertible into (a) shares of Series 1 Common Stock at an initial Conversion Rate (the Conversion Rate) equal to the product of (1) the conversion rate in effect with respect to the Nextel Communications, Inc. Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger times (2) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock into which each share of Nextel Class A common stock is converted pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, as described below, and (b) an amount in cash (the Merger Cash) equal to the product of (1) the conversion rate in effect with respect to the Nextel Communications, Inc. Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger times (2) the amount of cash (if any) into which each share of Nextel Class A common stock is converted pursuant to the Merger Agreement (excluding any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares). As promptly as practicable on or after the Conversion Date, the Corporation will (x) issue and deliver to the Transfer Agent a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion, with any fractional shares rounded up to full shares or, at the Corporations option, paid in cash in lieu of any fraction of a share, based on the Sale Price of the Series 1 Common Stock on the Trading Day preceding the Conversion Date and (y) deliver to the Transfer Agent the amount of Merger Cash (if any) payable upon conversion. In addition, if a Holder elects to convert, the Corporation will pay to such Holder, contemporaneously with the delivery of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion, the sum of $30.00 per share of Ninth Series (the Special Dividend).
 
(ii) The Corporations delivery to the Holder of (x) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock into which the Ninth Series is convertible (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock), (y) the amount of Merger Cash (if any) into which the Ninth Series is convertible
36
and (z) the Special Dividend will be deemed to satisfy the Corporations obligation to pay the Liquidation Preference on the Ninth Series.
 
(iii) To convert certificated Ninth Series into Series 1 Common Stock and Merger Cash, a Holder must (i) complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the Ninth Series certificate (or complete and manually sign a facsimile thereof) and deliver such notice to the Transfer Agent, (ii) surrender the Ninth Series certificate to the Transfer Agent, (iii) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and (iv) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes. The date on which all of the foregoing requirements have been satisfied is the Conversion Date.
 
(iv) All shares of Series 1 Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Ninth Series shall be validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
(v) The Conversion Rate shall be subject to adjustments from time to time as follows:
 
(A) If the Corporation shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution in Series 1 Common Stock to all holders of any outstanding Series 1 Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined in subparagraph (viii) below) fixed for such dividend or distribution and of which the numerator shall be the sum of such number of outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock and the total number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this subparagraph (v)(A) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(B) If the Corporation shall offer or issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its outstanding Series 1 Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Series 1 Common Stock at a price per share less than the average market price (determined as provided in subparagraph (viii) below) on the Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date after such Record Date by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) at the close of business on the Record Date plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock which the aggregate subscription or purchase price of the total number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock subject to such rights, options or warrants would purchase at such average market price and of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) at the close of business on the Record Date plus the total number of additional shares of Series 1 Common Stock subject to such rights, options or warrants for subscription or purchase. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to purchase or receive such rights, options or warrants. To the extent that shares of Series 1 Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights, options or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase Series 1 Common Stock at less than such average market price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Series 1 Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration
37
received for such rights, options or warrants, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. In lieu of the foregoing adjustment the Corporation may make adequate provision so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a share of the Ninth Series (or any portion thereof) the amount of such rights, options or warrants such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such share of the Ninth Series (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date.
 
(C) If the outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased and, conversely, if the outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(D) In case the Corporation shall issue any Series 1 Common Stock or Right (as defined in subparagraph (viii) below) (excluding (i) any Right issued in any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (v)(A) or (v)(B) above, (ii) Series 1 Common Stock issued pursuant to (x) any Rights outstanding on the Effective Date or (y) a Right, if on the date such Right was issued, the exercise, conversion or exchange price per share of Series 1 Common Stock with respect thereto was at least equal to the then average market price of the Series 1 Common Stock and (iii) any Series 1 Common Stock or Right issued as consideration when any corporation or business is acquired, merged into or becomes part of the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation in an arms-length transaction between the Corporation and another Person approved by the Board of Directors and, if such Person is an Affiliate of the Corporation, approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors who are neither (A) officers or employees of the Corporation nor (B) Affiliates of such other Person) at a price per share of Series 1 Common Stock (determined in the case of any such Right, by dividing (x) the total consideration receivable by the Corporation in consideration of the sale and issuance of such Right, plus the total consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock covered by such Right) that is lower than the average market price per share of Series 1 Common Stock in effect immediately prior to such sale or issuance, then the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock thereafter issuable upon conversion of each share of the Ninth Series shall be determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) immediately after such sale or issuance and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) immediately prior to such sale or issuance plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received (determined as provided below) for such sale or issuance would purchase at such average market price per share of Series 1 Common Stock. For purposes of this subparagraph (v)(D), the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock which the holder of any such Right shall be entitled to subscribe for or purchase shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding as of the date of such sale and issuance and the consideration received by the Corporation therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the Corporation for such Right, plus the consideration or premiums stated in such Right to be paid for the Series 1 Common Stock covered thereby. In case the Corporation shall sell and issue Series 1 Common Stock or any Right for a consideration consisting, in whole or in part, of property other than cash or its equivalent, then in determining the price per share of Series 1 Common Stock and the consideration received by the Corporation for purposes of the first sentence of this subparagraph (v)(D), the Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith, the fair value of said property, which determination shall be evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors. In case the Corporation shall sell and issue any Right together with one or more other securities as part of a unit at a price per unit, then in determining the price per share of Series 1 Common Stock and the consideration received by the Corporation for purposes of the first sentence of this subparagraph (v)(D), the Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith, the fair value of the Right then being sold as part of such unit.
 
38
(E) If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Series 1 Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of any class of capital stock, or other property (including securities, but excluding (i) any rights, options or warrants referred to in subparagraph (v)(B) of this paragraph (i), (ii) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and (iii) any dividend or distribution referred to in subparagraph (v)(A) of this paragraph (i), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the average market price per share of the Series 1 Common Stock on such Record Date less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) of the portion of the assets, shares or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Series 1 Common Stock and the numerator shall be such average market price per share of the Series 1 Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date;
provided
,
however
, that, in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the distributed assets or securities applicable to one share of Series 1 Common Stock is equal to or greater than the average market price of the Series 1 Common Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a share of the Ninth Series (or any portion thereof) the amount of distributed assets or securities such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such share of the Ninth Series (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this subparagraph (E) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities comprising such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average market price per share pursuant to subparagraph (viii)(A).
 
(F) If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, make a Cash Distribution in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (1) the aggregate amount of any other Cash Distributions made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such current Cash Distribution in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (v)(F) or subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made and (2) the aggregate amount of any Excess Purchase Payments made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such current Cash Distribution in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (v)(F) or subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made, exceeds 10% of the Corporations Market Capitalization on the Record Date for such current Cash Distribution (the amount of such excess being the Distribution Excess Amount), then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such current Cash Distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on such Record Date by a fraction (I) the denominator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such Record Date less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the Distribution Excess Amount divided by (y) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding on such Record Date plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding on such Record Date and (II) the numerator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such Record Date. If such current Cash Distribution is not made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such current Cash Distribution had not been declared.
 
(G) If the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall make Excess Purchase Payments with respect to any tender offer in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (1) the aggregate amount of any other Excess Purchase Payments made within the 12 months preceding such current Excess Purchase Payment in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to subparagraph (v)(F) or this subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made and (2) the aggregate amount of any Cash Distributions made within the 12 months preceding such current Excess Purchase Payment in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to subparagraph (v)(F) or this subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made, exceeds 10% of the Corporations Market Capitalization as of the Expiration Date for such tender offer (the amount of such excess being the Tender Excess Amount), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after
39
the Expiration Date, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on the Expiration Date by a fraction (I) the denominator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the Expiration Date less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the Tender Excess Amount divided by (y) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding on such Expiration Date plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding on such Expiration Date (but excluding any shares purchased in such tender offer) and (II) the numerator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the Expiration Date. If the Corporation is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Corporation is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made.
 
(vi) No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such rate then in effect;
provided
,
however
, that any adjustments that would otherwise be required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Except as stated above, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Series 1 Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Series 1 Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing. All calculations under subparagraph (i)(v) shall be made by the Corporation and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value of the Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(vii) The Corporation will provide to the Holders reasonable notice (which obligation may be satisfied by means of a public announcement and the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission containing the information in such public announcement) of any event that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this paragraph (i) so as to permit the Holders to effect a conversion of Ninth Series into shares of Series 1 Common Stock prior to the occurrence of such event.
 
(viii) For purposes of this paragraph (i), the following terms shall have the meaning indicated:
 
(A) average market price means the average of the daily Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the date in question.
 
(B) Cash Distribution means the distribution by the Corporation to all holders of its Series 1 Common Stock of cash (excluding any cash that is part of a distribution referred to in subparagraph (v)(E) or cash distributed upon a merger or consolidation described in subparagraph (i)(xii)).
 
(C) Excess Purchase Payment means the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a board resolution) of any non-cash consideration required to be paid with respect to one share of Series 1 Common Stock acquired or to be acquired in a tender offer made by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Series 1 Common Stock over (y) the Sale Price per share of Series 1 Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date for such tender offer.

(F) Record Date shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Series 1 Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Series 1 Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any
40
combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
 
(G) Right shall mean any right, option or warrant to subscribe for or purchase Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(ix) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation shall promptly file with the Transfer Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Corporation shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment is effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder at such Holders last address appearing on the register of Holders maintained by the Transfer Agent within 20 days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
 
(x) In any case in which this paragraph provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a Record Date for an event, the Corporation may defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to any Holder of any shares of the Ninth Series converted after such Record Date and before the occurrence of such event the additional Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment. In the case of any such deferral, if the event triggering an adjustment under subparagraph (i)(v) does not occur, the Conversion Rate in respect of any conversion effected during such deferral period shall be the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Record Date for the relevant event and such additional shares of Series 1 Common Stock subject to deferral shall not be issued in respect of such conversion.
 
(xi) For purposes of this paragraph (i), the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of Series 1 Common Stock. The Corporation shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on Series 1 Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation.

(xiii) Without limiting the Corporations right and ability to take any other action with respect to the Ninth Series or any portion thereof, the Corporation from time to time may, to the extent permitted by law, increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of at least 20 days if the Board of Directors has made a determination, in its sole discretion, that such increase would be in the best interests of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive. The Corporation will give notice of such increase at least 15 days prior to the increase. The Corporation may, at its option, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to and subject to those set forth above, as the Board of Directors deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Series 1 Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or rights to acquire stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
 
(xiv) Without limiting any other exception contained in paragraph (i), and in addition thereto, no adjustment under subparagraph (v)(D) need be made for:
 
41
(A) grants of Rights or issuances of Series 1 Common Stock to employees, officers or independent directors of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (and issuances of Series 1 Common Stock upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any such Rights) pursuant to the terms of any incentive equity, stock purchase or similar plan maintained or sponsored by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, so long as such plan has been approved by the Board of Directors;
 
(B) issuances of Rights or Series 1 Common Stock in bona fide public offerings or private placements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, Regulation D thereunder or Regulation S under the Securities Act, involving at least one investment bank of national reputation (provided any such private placement is to 10 or more beneficial holders); or
 
(C) any issuance of Rights or Series 1 Common Stock if the Corporation committed to issue such Rights or Series 1 Common Stock prior to their issuance for an amount of consideration per share of Series 1 Common Stock (determined in the case of a Right as set forth in subparagraph (v)(D)) not less than the Sale Price of the Series 1 Common Stock on the date of such commitment.
 
(j)
Mandatory Conversion
. (i) At any time, if the Corporation reasonably believes that any shares of the Ninth Series are held by or on account of a Non-U.S. Holder, such Ninth Series will be subject to mandatory conversion (a
Mandatory Conversion), at the option of the Corporation, upon written notice (a Mandatory Conversion Notice) to such Non-U.S. Holder. In addition, upon any (x) optional redemption by the Corporation of a Holders shares of the Ninth Series, (y) tender by a Holder of any of such Holders shares of the Ninth Series for acquisition thereof by the Corporation, or (z) exercise by a Holder of any of its conversion rights, the Corporation reasonably believes that any such Holder is a Non-U. S. Holder, the shares of the Ninth Series held by such Holder will be subject to Mandatory Conversion, and such Mandatory Conversion will preempt any conversion or tender rights that any such Non-U.S. Holder would otherwise have in respect of its shares of the Ninth Series.
 
(ii) The Mandatory Conversion Notice will be mailed to the Non-U.S. Holders address as it appears on the stock transfer records of Holders maintained by the Transfer Agent and shall specify the number of the shares of the Ninth Series subject to such notice, the certificate numbers of such shares (if such shares are held in certificated form by such Non-U.S. Holder) and the basis for the Corporations belief that any such Holder is a Non-U.S. Holder. Such Holders shares of the Ninth Series will be deemed to have been converted as of the date of the Mandatory Conversion Notice unless such Holder has established within 10 days after the date of any such notice by written documentation or other evidence to the Corporations reasonable satisfaction that it is a U.S. Holder.
 
(iii) The Corporation will (i) issue and deliver to the Transfer Agent a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon the Mandatory Conversion, with any fractional shares rounded up to full shares or, at the Corporations option, paid in cash in lieu of any fraction of a share, based on the Sale Price of the Series 1 Common Stock on the Trading Day preceding the applicable Mandatory Conversion Notice, and (ii) deliver to the Transfer Agent cash in an amount equal to the Merger Cash (if any) payable upon Mandatory Conversion. Any Mandatory Conversion will be conducted in accordance with the conversion procedures described under paragraph (i). The Corporations delivery to the Holder of the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock and the amount of Merger Cash (if any) into which such Holders shares of the Ninth Series are convertible hereunder (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock, if any) will be deemed to satisfy the Corporations obligation to pay the Liquidation Preference on the Ninth Series to the applicable Conversion Date.
 
(iv) If the Transfer Agent holds, in accordance herewith, Series 1 Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock, if any) sufficient to pay the conversion price and the amount of Merger Cash (if any) payable upon conversion on the date of the Mandatory Conversion Notice with respect to any shares of the Ninth Series, then, on and after such date, such shares of the Ninth Series will cease to be outstanding and the Liquidation Preference thereon shall cease to accrete whether or not book-entry transfer of such Ninth Series is made or such Ninth Series is delivered to the Transfer Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Series 1 Common Stock, Merger Cash, if any, and cash, if any, for fractional shares upon delivery of the Ninth Series certificate or book-entry transfer of such shares of the Ninth Series to the Transfer Agent).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of the Ninth Series, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any shares of the Ninth Series held by a non-consenting Holder): (A) alter the voting rights with respect to the Ninth Series or reduce the number of shares of the Ninth Series whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the terms of the Ninth Series, (B) reduce the amount of or rate of accretion of the Liquidation Preference of any share of the Ninth Series or adversely alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Ninth Series, or make any change that adversely affects the right to convert the Ninth Series or the right to require the Corporation to purchase the Ninth Series, (C) make any share of the Ninth Series payable in money other than United States dollars, (D) make any change in the provisions of this Section 10.8 relating to waivers of the rights of Holders to receive the Liquidation Preference on the Ninth Series or (E) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.

provided
,
however
, that holders of Voting Common Stock, voting together as a separate class in accordance with Section 3.2(b), shall be entitled to vote upon a proposed amendment to these Articles of Incorporation if such amendment would (A) increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of Voting Common Stock, (B) increase or decrease the par value of the shares of Voting Common Stock or (C) alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of Voting Common Stock so as to affect them adversely.

provided
that in any vote in which the holders of Voting Common Stock vote together as a separate class solely because the shares of Voting Common Stock are the only Voting Securities of the Corporation that are outstanding, or are the only securities of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter, and neither the law nor these Articles of Incorporation entitle the Voting Common Stock to vote as a separate class, the vote per share in Section 3.2(a) shall apply.

The holders of shares of any Applicable Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Board of Directors in accordance with this Section 5.1, dividends in respect of such Applicable Stock equivalent on a per share basis to those payable on any Other Stock. Dividends on shares of Applicable Stock shall be payable on the same date fixed for payment of the corresponding dividend on shares of the Other Stock and shall be in an amount per share equal to the full per share amount of any cash dividend paid on shares of such Other Stock, plus the full per share amount (payable in kind) of any non cash dividend paid on shares of such Other Stock,
provided
that if the Corporation shall declare and pay any dividend on shares of any Other Stock payable in shares of such Other Stock, or in options, warrants or rights to acquire shares of such Other Stock, or in securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of such Other Stock, then in each case, the Corporation shall declare and pay, at the same time that it declares and pays any such dividend, an equivalent dividend per share on the Applicable Stock payable in shares of such Applicable Stock, or equivalent corresponding options, warrants or rights to acquire shares of such Applicable Stock, or equivalent corresponding securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of such Applicable Stock.

(a) No reclassification, subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Applicable Stock shall be effected directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, any reclassification, subdivision or combination effected pursuant to a consolidation, merger or liquidation) unless at the same time shares of each Other Stock are reclassified, subdivided or combined on an equal per share basis so that the holders of shares of each Other Stock (i) are entitled, in the aggregate, to a number of Votes representing the same percentage of the Voting Power of the Corporation relative to such Applicable Stock as were represented by the shares of such Other Stock outstanding immediately before such reclassification, subdivision or combination and (ii) maintain all of the rights associated with such Other Stock set forth in these Articles of Incorporation, including without limitation the right to receive dividends and other distributions (including liquidating and other distributions) that are equivalent to those payable per share in respect of shares of such Applicable Stock, subject to the limitations, restrictions and conditions on such rights contained herein.

The Corporation shall not effect, directly or indirectly, any such reclassification, subdivision or combination of outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock unless it delivers to the holders of Series 2 Common Stock written notice of its intent to take such action at least ten Business Days before taking such action.
 
(c)
Exclusionary Tender Offers.
If the Board of Directors shall determine not to oppose a tender offer by a Person other than a Cable Holder for Voting Securities of the Corporation representing not less than 35% of the Voting Power of the Corporation, and the terms of such tender offer do not permit the holders of Series 2 Common Stock to sell an equal or greater percentage of their shares as the holders of Series 1 Common Stock are permitted to sell taking into account any proration, then each holder of Series 2 Common Stock shall have the right (but not the obligation) to deliver to the Corporation a written notice requesting conversion of certain shares of Series 2 Common Stock designated by such holder of Series 2 Common Stock into Series 1 Common Stock, upon which delivery each share of Series 2 Common Stock so designated in such notice shall automatically convert (without the payment of any consideration) into one duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Series 1 Common Stock,

provided
that such Persons shall be entitled to receive when paid any dividends declared on the Converted Series Shares as of a record date preceding the time the Converted Series Shares were converted (the Series Conversion Time) and unpaid as of the Series Conversion Time.

8
belief that a Voting Conversion Event or Motorola Transfer, as the case may be, shall occur shall be conclusive and shall obligate the Corporation to effect such conversion in a timely manner so as to enable each such holder to distribute, dispose of or sell such shares of Series 1 Common Stock in connection with such Voting Conversion Event or Motorola Transfer, as the case may be;
provided
that the Corporation will not cancel the shares of Non-Voting Common Stock so converted before the tenth day following such Voting Conversion Event or Motorola Transfer and will reserve such shares until such tenth day for reissuance in compliance with the following proviso; and
provided
further
that, if any shares of Non-Voting Common Stock are converted into shares of Series 1 Common Stock in connection with a Voting Conversion Event or a Motorola Transfer and any such shares of Series 1 Common Stock are not actually distributed, disposed of or sold pursuant to such Voting Conversion Event or Motorola Transfer, such shares of Series 1 Common Stock which were not so distributed, disposed of or sold shall be promptly converted back into the same number of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock and (ii) Motorola, at its election, will be entitled to convert any or all of its shares of Non-Voting Common Stock into shares of Series 1 Common Stock upon the occurrence of any Motorola Conversion Event described in Section 8(c)(ii) hereof.
 
(e) Each conversion of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock into shares of Series 1 Common Stock will be effected by the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be converted at the principal office of the Corporation at any time during normal business hours, together with a written notice by the holder of such shares of Non-Voting Common Stock stating that such holder desires to convert the shares, or a stated number of the shares, of Non-Voting Common Stock represented by such certificate or certificates into shares of Series 1 Common Stock. Such notice shall also state the name or names (with addresses) and denominations in which the certificate or certificates for such Series 1 Common Stock are to be issued. Such conversion will be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such certificate or certificates have been surrendered and such notice has been received, and at such time the rights of the holder of the converted shares of Non-Voting Common Stock as such holder will cease and the person or persons in whose name or names the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series 1 Common Stock are to be issued upon such conversion will be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Series 1 Common Stock represented thereby.
 
(f) Promptly after such surrender and the receipt of such written notice, the Corporation will issue and deliver in accordance with the surrendering holders instructions each of the following:
 
(i) the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon such conversion; and
 
(ii) a certificate representing any shares of Non-Voting Common Stock which were represented by the certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection with such conversion but which were not converted into shares of Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(g) The issuance of certificates representing shares of Series 1 Common Stock received upon conversion of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock will be made without charge to the holders of such shares for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and the related issuance of Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(h) The Corporation will not close its books against the transfer of shares of Corporation Common Stock in any manner which would interfere with the timely conversion of any shares of Non-Voting Common Stock.
(i) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued Series 1 Common Stock, and issued Series 1 Common Stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Non-Voting Common Stock, the full number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock then deliverable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Non-Voting Common Stock. If, at the time of conversion of any Non-Voting Common Stock, the Series 1 Common Stock is listed on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Corporation will cause the Series 1 Common Stock issued in such conversion to be listed on such exchange or automated quotation system within 60 days of such conversion, subject to official notice of issuance.
 
(j) Subject to Section 8(d), upon the retirement of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock, (i) such shares shall not resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of that class, (ii) such shares shall not be reissued and (iii) upon the execution, acknowledgment and filing of a certificate in accordance with K.G.C.C. Sections 17-6003 and
9
17-6603 (or any successor provisions) stating that the reissuance of such shares is prohibited, identifying the shares and reciting their retirement, then the filing of such certificate shall have the effect of amending these Articles of Incorporation so as to reduce accordingly the number of authorized shares of Non-Voting Common Stock or if such retired shares constitute all of the authorized shares of such class, then the filing of such certificate shall have the effect of amending these Articles of Incorporation automatically so as to eliminate all references to such class of stock therefrom.

(ii) In the event the Corporation shall (A) declare any dividend on Series 1 Common Stock payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock or (C) combine the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the per share amount to which holders of shares of the Sixth Series would be entitled immediately before such event under clause (B) of paragraph (i) of this Section 10.6(b) shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before such event.
 
(iii) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Sixth Series as provided above in paragraph (i) of this Section 10.6(b) immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Series 1

Accrued but unpaid dividends shall cumulate but shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Sixth Series in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.

Except as otherwise provided in these Articles of Incorporation, in any Certificate of Designation establishing a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or otherwise required by law, the holders of the shares of the Sixth Series and the holders of Voting Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.

(ii) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 10.6(d), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
(e)
Reacquired Shares
. Any shares of the Sixth Series purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof.

(i) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of the Sixth Series shall be entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of stock ranking junior (as to the amount payable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Sixth Series, the greater of (A) $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of distribution, whether or not earned or declared, or (B) an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 2,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Series 1 Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall (x) declare any dividend on Series 1 Common Stock payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock, (y) subdivide the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock or (z) combine the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of the Sixth Series would be entitled immediately before such event pursuant to clause (B) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before such event.
(ii) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of stock ranking on a parity (as to the amount payable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Sixth Series shall not receive any distributions except for distributions made ratably on the Sixth Series and all other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
 
(g)
Consolidation, Merger, Etc.
In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Series 1 Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of the Sixth Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 2,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Series 1 Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall (i) declare any dividend on Series 1 Common Stock payable in shares of Series 1 Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Series 1 Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of the Sixth Series would be entitled immediately before such event pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of the Sixth Series shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before such event.
 
17
(h)
Ranking.
The shares of the Sixth Series shall rank junior to all other series of the Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise. Nothing herein shall preclude the Board of Directors of the Corporation from creating any additional series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the shares of the Sixth Series as to the payment of dividends or distribution of assets.
 
(i)
Fractional Shares
. Shares of the Sixth Series may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holders fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of shares of the Sixth Series.
 
Section 10.7.
Preferred Stock-Seventh Series Convertible.
 
(a)
Amount, Rank and Designation
. The shares to constitute the Seventh Series of Preferred Stock shall number 300,000 shares. The designation thereof shall be Preferred Stock-Seventh Series, Convertible (hereinafter Seventh Series). Shares of the Seventh Series shall rank junior as to dividends and upon liquidation to shares of any other Preferred Stock designated as senior to the Seventh Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up (Senior Stock), and shall have a preference over the shares of the Corporation Common Stock and any other class or series of Junior Stock.
 
(b)
Dividends
. Holders of record of shares of the Seventh Series will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends (Preferred Dividends) payable at the rate of $6.73 per share quarterly in arrears on each September 30, December 31, March 31 and June 30 (each a Dividend Payment Date) or, if any such date is not a Business Day, the Preferred Dividends due on such Dividend Payment Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day. Preferred Dividends on the Seventh Series shall be cumulative and shall accumulate from the date of original issuance of the Seventh Series. Preferred Dividends shall be payable to holders of record as they appear on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, net of any amounts required to be withheld for or with respect to taxes, on such record dates, not more than 60 days preceding the payment date thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. Preferred Dividends payable on the Seventh Series for any period less than a full quarterly dividend period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the actual number of days elapsed in any period less than one month. Preferred Dividends shall accrue on a daily basis whether or not there are funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of such dividends and whether or not such Preferred Dividends are declared. Accrued but unpaid Preferred Dividends shall accumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable, but no interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid Preferred Dividends. Before any dividends on the Corporation Common Stock or any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Seventh Series as to dividends shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment, the holders of shares of the Seventh Series shall be entitled to receive the full accumulated cash dividends for all quarterly dividend periods ending on or before the date on which any dividend on any such class or series of stock ranking junior to the Seventh Series as to dividends is declared or is to be paid.
 
(c)
Conversion.
 
(i) Each holder of shares of Seventh Series may at such holders option at any time convert any or all of such holders shares of Seventh Series into (A) if such holder is a Cable Holder, shares of Series 2 Common Stock, and (B) if such holder is not a Cable Holder, shares of Series 1 Common Stock. All references herein to shares of Series 2 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Seventh Series shall be deemed to refer to shares of Series 1 Common Stock if the holder of such Seventh Series is not a Cable Holder. Such shares of Seventh Series shall be convertible into a number of fully paid and nonassessable whole shares of Series 2 Common Stock as is equal to the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series surrendered for conversion divided by the Initial Conversion Price (as adjusted from time to time, the Conversion Price). In case of the redemption of any shares of the Seventh Series, such right of conversion shall cease and terminate as to the shares duly called for redemption at the close of business on the date fixed for redemption, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. If the Corporation defaults with respect to such payment, the right to convert the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the business day next preceding the date that such default is cured. Upon conversion the Corporation shall make no payment or adjustment on account of dividends accrued or in arrears on the Seventh Series surrendered for conversion.
 
18
(ii) Holders of shares of Seventh Series at the close of business on a record date for any payment of declared Preferred Dividends shall be entitled to receive the Preferred Dividends payable on those shares of Seventh Series on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion pursuant to this section of those shares of Seventh Series following such record date and before the close of business on such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, upon any conversion of shares of Seventh Series, the Corporation shall make no payment of or allowance of unpaid Preferred Dividends, whether or not in arrears, on such shares of Seventh Series, or for previously declared dividends or distributions on the shares of Series 2 Common Stock issued upon conversion.
 
(iii) Conversion of shares of Seventh Series may be effected by delivering certificates evidencing such shares of Seventh Series, together with written notice of conversion stating the number of shares to be converted and a proper assignment of such certificates to the Corporation or in blank, to the office of the transfer agent for the Seventh Series or to any other office or agency maintained by the Corporation for that purpose and otherwise in accordance with conversion procedures established by the Corporation. Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately before the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied. The Corporation shall as promptly as practicable after any conversion pursuant to this section issue and deliver to the converting holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of whole shares of Series 2 Common Stock into which such shares of Seventh Series were converted. Upon conversion of less than the entire number of the shares of Seventh Series represented by any certificate, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the converting holder a new certificate representing the number of shares of Seventh Series not converted. The Corporation shall effect such conversion as soon as practicable;
provided
that the Corporation shall not be required to convert shares of Seventh Series, and no surrender of shares of Seventh Series shall be effective for that purpose, while the stock transfer books of the Corporation for the Series 2 Common Stock are closed for any reason, but the surrender of shares of Seventh Series for conversion during any period while such books are so closed shall become effective for conversion immediately upon the reopening of such books, as if the conversion had been made on the date such shares of Seventh Series were surrendered, and at the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such surrender.
 
(iv) No fraction of a share of Series 2 Common Stock shall be issued upon any conversion. In lieu of the fraction of a share to which the holder of shares of the Seventh Series surrendered for conversion would otherwise be entitled, such holder shall receive, as soon as practicable after the date of conversion, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the market value of a full share of Series 1 Common Stock. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the market value of a share of Series 1 Common Stock shall be the Closing Price of such a share on the day immediately preceding the date upon which such shares of Seventh Series are surrendered for conversion.
(v) The Conversion Price in effect at any time shall be subject to adjustment as follows:
 
(A) If the Corporation shall: (1) pay a dividend on the Voting Common Stock in shares of Voting Common Stock, (2) subdivide the outstanding shares of Voting Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (3) combine the outstanding shares of Voting Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, (4) pay a dividend on the Voting Common Stock in shares of its capital stock (other than Voting Common Stock) or (5) issue any shares of its capital stock by reclassification of the shares of Voting Common Stock (other than any reclassification by way of merger or binding share exchange that is subject to Section 10.7(c)(v)(H)), then the Conversion Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that if the holder elects to convert shares of Seventh Series after such time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number of shares of capital stock which, if such conversion had occurred immediately prior to such time, he would have owned upon such conversion and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. Subject to Section 10.7(c)(v)(F) for a dividend or distribution, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the dividend or distribution, and for a subdivision, combination or reclassification, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of the subdivision, combination or reclassification.
 
19
(B) If the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to the holders of the Voting Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Voting Common Stock (or Convertible Securities) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share, after adding thereto an allocable portion of the Conversion Price of the right or warrant to purchase such Convertible Securities, computed on the basis of the maximum number of shares of Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Securities) less than the Current Market Price per share on the Determination Date, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Voting Common Stock so offered (or the aggregate initial conversion price of the Convertible Securities so offered, after adding thereto the aggregate conversion price of the rights or warrants to purchase such Convertible Securities) to holders of Voting Common Stock (and to holders of Convertible Securities referred to in the following paragraph if the distribution to which this paragraph (B) applies is also being made to such holders) would purchase at such Current Market Price, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Voting Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the Convertible Securities so offered are initially convertible). The adjustment contemplated by this paragraph (B) shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the close of business on such record date;
provided
,
however
, to the extent that shares of Voting Common Stock (or Convertible Securities) have not been issued when such rights or warrants expire (or, in the case of rights or warrants to purchase Convertible Securities which have been exercised, if all of the shares of Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Securities have not been issued prior to the expiration of the conversion right thereof), the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of shares (or Convertible Securities) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants (or the conversion of such Convertible Securities).
 
For purposes of this paragraph (B) the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on any record date shall be deemed to include the maximum number of shares of Voting Common Stock the issuance of which would be necessary to effect the full exercise, exchange or conversion of all Convertible Securities outstanding on such record date which are then exercisable, exchangeable or convertible at a price (before giving effect to any adjustment to such price for the distribution to which this paragraph (B) is being applied) equal to or less than the Current Market Price per share of Voting Common Stock on the applicable Determination Date, if all of such Convertible Securities were deemed to have been exercised, exchanged or converted immediately prior to the opening of business on such record date. In case any subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
(C) If the Corporation shall distribute to the holders of Voting Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets or subscription rights or warrants (excluding (x) dividends or distributions referred to in Section 10.7(c)(v)(A) and distributions of rights or warrants referred to in Section 10.7(c)(v)(B) and (y) cash dividends or other cash distributions, unless such cash dividends or cash distributions are Extraordinary Cash Dividends), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price on the Determination Date, less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) on such record date of the evidences of indebtedness, assets (including Extraordinary Cash Dividends), subscription rights or warrants to be distributed to the holders of Voting Common Stock (and to the holders of Convertible Securities referred to below if the distribution to which this paragraph (C) applies is also being made to such holders), and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on such record date multiplied by such Current Market Price. For purposes of this paragraph (C), the number of shares of Voting Common Stock outstanding on any record date shall be deemed to include the maximum number of shares of Voting Common Stock the issuance of which would be necessary to effect the full exercise, exchange or conversion of all Convertible Securities outstanding on such record date which are then exercisable,
20
exchangeable or convertible at a price (before giving effect to any adjustment to such price for the distribution to which this paragraph (C) is being applied) equal to or less than the Current Market Price per share of Voting Common Stock on the applicable Determination Date, if all of such Convertible Securities were deemed to have been exercised, exchanged or converted immediately prior to the opening of business on such record date.
 
For purposes of this paragraph (C), the term Extraordinary Cash Dividend shall mean any cash dividend with respect to the Voting Common Stock the amount of which, together with the aggregate amount of cash dividends on the Voting Common Stock to be aggregated with such cash dividend in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph, equals or exceeds the threshold percentage set forth below in the following sentence. If, upon the date prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to a cash dividend on the Voting Common Stock, the aggregate of the amount of such cash dividend together with the amounts of all cash dividends on the Voting Common Stock with Ex-Dividend Dates occurring in the 365 consecutive day period ending on the date prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to the cash dividend to which this provision is being applied (other than any such other cash dividends with Ex-Dividend Dates occurring in such period for which a prior adjustment to the Conversion Price was previously made under this paragraph (C)) equals or exceeds on a per share basis five percent (5%) of the average of the Closing Prices during the period beginning on the date after the first such Ex-Dividend Date in such period and ending on the date prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to the cash dividend to which this provision is being applied (except that if no other cash dividend has had an Ex-Dividend Date occurring in such period, the period for calculating the average of the Closing Prices shall be the period commencing 365 days prior to the date immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to the cash dividend to which this provision is being applied), such cash dividend together with each other cash dividend with an Ex-Dividend Date occurring in such 365-day period that is aggregated with such cash dividend in accordance with this paragraph shall be deemed to be an Extraordinary Cash Dividend.
 
The adjustment pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (C) shall be made successively whenever any distribution to which this paragraph (C) applies is made, and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution.
 
(D) If this Section 10.7(c)(v) requires adjustments to the Conversion Price under more than one of clause (4) of the first sentence of paragraph (A), paragraph (B) or paragraph (C), and the record dates for the distribution giving rise to such adjustments shall occur on the same date, then such adjustments shall be made by applying, first, the provisions of paragraph (A), second the provisions of paragraph (C) and, third, the provisions of paragraph (B).
 
(E) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) thereof;
provided, however
, that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (E) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 10.7(c)(v) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.
(F) In any case in which this Section 10.7(c)(v) shall require that an adjustment in the Conversion Price be made effective as of the record date for a specified event, the Corporation may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event (x) issuing to the holder of the Seventh Series the shares, if any, issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares, if any, issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the Conversion Price in effect prior to such adjustment, if the Seventh Series is converted after such record date, and (y) paying to the holder cash or its check in lieu of any fractional interest to which the holder would be entitled pursuant to Section 10.7(c)(iv);
provided
,
however
, that the Corporation shall deliver to the holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing the holders right to receive such additional shares and such cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
 
(G) If the Corporation consolidates with or merges into, or transfers (other than by mortgage or pledge) its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to, another Person or the Corporation is a party to a merger or binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Voting Common Stock, or the Voting Common Stock is converted into another class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the Corporation (or its successor in such transaction) or the transferee of such properties and assets shall make appropriate provision so that the holders certificate representing shares of Seventh Series shall thereafter be convertible,
21
upon the terms and conditions specified in the certificates, for the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Voting Common Stock purchasable upon conversion of the holders Seventh Series immediately before the effective date of such transaction (assuming, to the extent applicable, that such holder of Voting Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election with respect thereto, and received per share the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets received per share of Voting Common Stock by a plurality of the nonelecting shares of Voting Common Stock); and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set forth in this Section 10.7(c)(v) with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holder of the Seventh Series shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any such other securities or assets thereafter deliverable on the conversion of the holders Seventh Series. The subdivision or combination of the Voting Common Stock at any time outstanding into a greater or lesser number of shares of Voting Common Stock shall not be deemed to be a reclassification of the Voting Common Stock for the purposes of this subsection. The Corporation shall not effect any such consolidation, merger, transfer or binding share exchange unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor (if other than the Corporation) resulting from such consolidation or merger or the Person purchasing such assets or other appropriate Person shall assume, by written instrument, the obligation to deliver to the holders of the Seventh Series such securities, cash or other assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder may be entitled to purchase and the other obligations in this Section 10.7.
 
The Corporation may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) of this Section 10.7(c)(v), as it shall in its sole discretion determine to be advisable.
 
(H) Subject to Section 10.7(c)(v)(E) and to the remaining provisions of this Section 10.7(c)(v)(H), in the event that a holder of Seventh Series would be entitled to receive upon conversion thereof pursuant to this Section 10.7(c)(v) any Redeemable Capital Stock and the Corporation redeems, exchanges or otherwise acquires all of the outstanding shares or other units of such Redeemable Capital Stock (such event being a Redemption Event), then, from and after the effective date of such Redemption Event, the holders of shares of Seventh Series then outstanding shall be entitled to receive upon conversion of such shares, in lieu of shares or units of such Redeemable Capital Stock, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon the Redemption Event by a holder of the number of shares or units of such Redeemable Capital Stock into which such shares of Seventh Series could have been converted immediately prior to the effective date of such Redemption Event (assuming, to the extent applicable, that such holder failed to exercise any rights of election with respect thereto and received per share or unit of such Redeemable Capital Stock the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property received per share or unit by a plurality of the non-electing shares or units of such Redeemable Capital Stock), and (from and after the effective date of such Redemption Event) the holders of the Seventh Series shall have no other conversion rights under these provisions with respect to such Redeemable Capital Stock.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the redemption price for the shares of such Redeemable Capital Stock is paid in whole or in part in Redemption Securities, and the Mirror Preferred Stock Condition is met, the Seventh Series shall not be convertible into such Redemption Securities and, from and after the applicable redemption date, the holders of any shares of Seventh Series that have not been exchanged for Mirror Preferred Stock and Exchange Preferred Stock shall have no conversion rights under these provisions except for any conversion right that may have existed immediately prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event with respect to any shares of stock (including the Voting Common Stock) or other securities or property other than the Redeemable Capital Stock so redeemed. The Corporation shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Mirror Preferred Stock Condition is satisfied. The Mirror Preferred Stock Condition will be satisfied in connection with a redemption of any Redeemable Capital Stock into which the Seventh Series is then convertible if appropriate provision is made so that the holders of the Seventh Series have the right to exchange their shares of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Redemption Event for Exchange Preferred Stock of the Corporation and Mirror Preferred Stock of the issuer of the Redemption Securities. The sum of the initial liquidation preferences of the shares of Exchange Preferred and Mirror Preferred Stock delivered in exchange for a share of Seventh Series will equal the Liquidation Preference of a share of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Redemption Event. The Mirror Preferred Stock will have an aggregate initial liquidation preference equal to the product of the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the quotient of (x) the product of the amount of shares of the Redeemable Capital Stock for which each share of Seventh Series is then convertible to be redeemed (determined immediately prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event) and the average of the daily Closing Prices of the Redeemable
22
Capital Stock for the period of ten consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event, divided by (y) the sum of the amount determined pursuant to clause (x), plus the fair value of the shares of stock or other securities or property (other than the Redeemable Capital Stock being redeemed) that would have been receivable by a holder of Seventh Series upon conversion thereof immediately prior to the effective date of the Redemption Event (such fair value to be determined in the case of stock or other securities with a Closing Price in the same manner as provided in clause (x) and otherwise by the Board of Directors in the exercise of its judgment). The shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will have an aggregate initial liquidation preference equal to the difference between the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the aggregate initial liquidation preference of the Mirror Preferred Stock. No shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will be issued in exchange for the Seventh Series if the shares of Exchange Preferred Stock would have no Liquidation Preference as a result of the above formula.
 
(I) If the Corporation effects a Spin Off, the Corporation shall make appropriate provision so that the holders of the Seventh Series have the right to exchange their shares of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Spin Off for Exchange Preferred Stock of the Corporation and Mirror Preferred Stock of the issuer of the Spin Off Securities. The sum of the initial liquidation preference of the shares of Exchange Preferred Stock and Mirror Preferred Stock delivered in exchange for a share of Seventh Series will equal the Liquidation Preference of a share of Seventh Series on the effective date of the Spin Off. The Mirror Preferred Stock will have an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the product of the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the quotient of (x) the product of the number (or fraction) of Spin Off Securities that would have been receivable upon such Spin Off by a holder of the number of shares of Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Seventh Series immediately prior to the effective date of the Spin Off and the average of the daily Closing Prices of the Spin Off Securities for the period of ten consecutive trading days commencing on the tenth trading day following the effective date of the Spin Off, divided by (y) the sum of the amount determined pursuant to clause (x), plus the fair value of the shares of Voting Common Stock and other securities or property (other than Spin Off Securities) that would have been receivable by a holder of a share of Seventh Series in the Spin Off following conversion thereof immediately prior to the effective date of the Spin Off (such fair value to be determined in the case of Voting Common Stock or other securities with a Closing Price in the same manner as provided in clause (x) and otherwise by the Board of Directors in the exercise of its judgment). The shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will have an aggregate initial liquidation preference equal to the difference between the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Seventh Series exchanged therefor and the aggregate initial liquidation preference of the Mirror Preferred Stock. No shares of Exchange Preferred Stock will be issued in exchange for the Seventh Series if the shares of Exchange Preferred Stock would have no Liquidation Preference as a result of the above formula. From and after the effective date of such Spin Off, the holders of any shares of Seventh Series that have not been exchanged for Mirror Preferred Stock and Exchange Preferred Stock as provided above shall have no conversion rights under these provisions with respect to such Spin Off Securities.
 
(vi) The Corporation shall pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Voting Common Stock on the conversion of Seventh Series;
provided
,
however
, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any registration of transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Voting Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of Seventh Series converted or to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.
 
(d)
Liquidation Rights
. Subject to prior payment of preferred amounts to which any Senior Stock is entitled, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation the holders of the Seventh Series will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to stockholders, before any distribution of the assets shall be made to the holders of the Corporation Common Stock or any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Seventh Series upon liquidation, the sum of U.S. $1,000 per share (the Liquidation Preference), plus in each case any accumulated unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), to the date of final distribution. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation the amounts payable with respect to the Seventh Series and any other Parity Stock are not paid in full, the holders of the Seventh Series and such Parity Stock will share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distribution to which they are entitled, the holders of Seventh Series shall not be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the
23
Corporation. A consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into one or more other corporations (whether or not the Corporation is the corporation surviving such consolidation or merger), or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation. Notice of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the Seventh Series, and shall be mailed to the holders of Seventh Series at their last addresses as they shall appear on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, at least 20 business days before any such action, stating the date on which any such action is expected to become effective. The failure to give or receive the notice required by this section or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
 
(e)
Redemption.
 
(i)
General
. The Corporation may at its option redeem the Seventh Series in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the Liquidation Preference per share of Seventh Series, plus any accumulated unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) up to but excluding such redemption date. If less than all the outstanding Seventh Series is to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata as nearly as practicable or by lot, or by such other method as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be equitable, without regard to whether the shares to be redeemed are convertible into Series 1 Common Stock or Series 2 Common Stock. Shares so redeemed shall be cancelled and upon such cancellation shall be deemed to be authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Corporation but shall not be reissued as shares of the same series.
 
(ii)
Mandatory Redemption
. To the extent permitted by law, the Corporation shall redeem, on November 23, 2008 (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day thereafter) (subject to extension as provided in the last sentence of this Section 10.7(e)(ii), the Mandatory Redemption Date), all remaining shares of Seventh Series then outstanding, at the redemption price of $1,000 for each share outstanding, plus an amount in cash equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the Mandatory Redemption Date. Prior to authorizing or making such redemption with respect to the Seventh Series, the Corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors shall, to the extent of funds legally available therefor, declare a dividend on the Seventh Series payable on the Mandatory Redemption Date in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Seventh Series as of such date and, if the Corporation does not have sufficient legally available funds to declare and pay all dividends accrued at the time of such redemption, any remaining accrued and unpaid dividends shall be added to the redemption price. After paying any accrued and unpaid dividends pursuant to the foregoing sentence, if the funds of the Corporation legally available for redemption of shares of the Seventh Series then required to be redeemed are insufficient to redeem the total number of such shares then outstanding, those funds which are legally available shall be used to redeem the maximum possible number of shares of the Seventh Series. At any time and from time to time thereafter, when additional funds of the Corporation are legally available to discharge its obligation to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Seventh Series required to be redeemed pursuant to this section (the Mandatory Redemption Obligation), such funds shall be immediately used to discharge such Mandatory Redemption Obligation until the balance of such shares have been redeemed. If and so long as the Mandatory Redemption Obligation shall not be fully discharged, (x) dividends on any remaining outstanding shares of Seventh Series shall continue to accrue and be added to the dividend payable pursuant to the third preceding sentence and (y) the Corporation shall not declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on any Parity Stock or Junior Stock. With respect to any Exchange Preferred Stock or Mirror Preferred Stock, the Mandatory Redemption Date shall be the later to occur of (i) November 23, 2008, and (ii) the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance of such Exchange Preferred Stock or Mirror Preferred Stock.
 
(iii)
Notice

(C) the redemption price;
 
(D) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for redemption;
 
(E) the amount of full cumulative dividends per share of Seventh Series to be redeemed accrued and unpaid up to but excluding such redemption date, and that dividends on shares of Seventh Series to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date unless the Corporation shall default in payment of the redemption price plus such full cumulative dividends accrued and unpaid thereon;

Any notice that is mailed as set forth above shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of shares of Seventh Series receives such notice, and failure to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Seventh Series.
 
(iv)
Mechanics of Redemption
. Upon surrender in accordance with the aforesaid notice of the certificate for any shares so redeemed (duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer if so required by the Corporation), the holders of record of such shares shall be entitled to receive the redemption price, without interest, plus full cumulative dividends thereon accrued and unpaid up to but excluding such redemption date out of funds legally available therefor.

. On the date of any redemption being made pursuant to this section, the Corporation shall, and at any time after notice of such redemption shall have been mailed and before the date of redemption the Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Seventh Series to be redeemed the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust company in the City of New York having a capital and surplus of at least $1 billion, with instructions to such bank or trust company to pay the full redemption amounts as provided herein to the holders of shares of Seventh Series upon surrender of certificates for such shares;
provided
,
however
, that the making of such deposit shall not release the Corporation from any of its obligations hereunder. Any moneys so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for such redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation and, upon demand, such bank or trust company shall pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of shares of Seventh Series so redeemed shall look only to the Corporation for the payment of the full redemption amounts, as provided herein.

If the funds deposited are not sufficient for redemption of the shares of the Seventh Series that were to be redeemed, then no certificates evidencing such shares shall be deemed
25
surrendered and such shares shall remain outstanding and the rights of holders of shares of Seventh Series shall continue to be those of holders of shares of the Seventh Series.

30
subparagraph (e)(iii), at a redemption price equal to the Liquidation Preference thereof on the Optional Redemption Date, upon not less than 7 days notice of redemption given by mail to the Holders;
provided
that the Corporation may condition consummation of any such optional redemption (if it is to be effected by a redemption of shares of the Ninth Series for cash) on the occurrence of any event and/or satisfaction of any condition identified as such in the relevant Redemption Notice to the Holders, and may withdraw such Redemption Notice (and thereby terminate its obligation to effect such optional redemption) by written notice to that effect given by mail to the Holders at least 3 days prior to the relevant Optional Redemption Date.

(B) The right of the Holders voting separately as one class to elect two Directors as described in subparagraph (f)(iii)(A) shall continue until such time as (1) in the event such right arises due to failure by the Corporation to comply with its obligations set forth in paragraph (g), the Corporation remedies any such failure and (2) in the event such right arises due to a default by the Corporation in the payment of the Liquidation Preference of any share of the Ninth Series on the Mandatory Redemption Date, the Corporation remedies such default, at which time the term of any Directors elected pursuant to subparagraph (f)(iii)(A) hereof shall terminate and the number of Directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced to the number necessary to reflect the termination of the right of the Holders to elect Directors, subject always to the same provisions for the renewal and divestment of such special voting rights in the case of any future Voting
32
Rights Triggering Event. At any time after voting power to elect Directors shall have become vested and be continuing in the Holders pursuant to subparagraph (f)(iii)(A) hereof, or if vacancies shall exist in the offices of Directors elected by the Holders, a proper officer of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of the Holders of record of at least 25% of the shares of the Ninth Series then outstanding addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation shall, call a special meeting of the Holders, for the purpose of electing the Directors which such Holders are entitled to elect. If such meeting shall not be called by the proper officer of the Corporation within 30 days after personal service of said written request upon the Secretary of the Corporation, or within 30 days after mailing the same within the United States by certified mail, addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation at its principal executive offices, then the Holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of the Ninth Series may designate in writing one of their number to call such meeting at the expense of the Corporation, and such meeting may be called by the Person so designated upon the notice required for the annual meetings of stockholders of the Corporation and shall be held at the place for holding the annual meetings of stockholders or such other place in the United States as shall be designated in such notice. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph (f)(iii)(B), no such special meeting shall be called if any such request is received less than 40 days before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. Any Holder so designated shall have, and the Corporation shall provide to such designated Holder, access to the lists of Holders for purposes of calling a meeting pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph (f)(iii)(B).
 
(C) At any meeting held for the purpose of electing Directors at which the Holders shall have the right, voting separately as one class, to elect Directors as aforesaid, the presence in person or by proxy of Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Ninth Series shall be required to constitute a quorum of the Ninth Series.
 
(D) Any vacancy occurring in the office of a Director elected by the Holders may be filled by the remaining Director elected by such Holders unless and until such vacancy shall be filled by such Holders.
 
(iv) In any case in which the Holders shall be entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (f) or pursuant to Kansas law, each Holder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of the Ninth Series held. Any action that may be taken hereunder by the Holders at a meeting may be taken by unanimous written consent of the Holders.
 
(g)
Change of Control
. (i) A Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred at such time after the Effective Date if there shall occur:
 
(x) the acquisition by any Person of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of transactions, of shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitling such Person to exercise 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in elections of Directors, other than any such acquisition by the Corporation, any subsidiary of the Corporation or any employee benefit plan of the Corporation; or
(y) any consolidation of the Corporation with, or merger of the Corporation into, any other Person, any merger of another Person into the Corporation, or any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another Person (other than (a) any such transaction (A) which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Corporation Common Stock and (B) pursuant to which holders of Corporation Common Stock immediately prior to such transaction have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of capital stock (or equivalent unit of ownership interest) entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors (or other equivalent governing body) of the continuing or surviving Person immediately after such transaction and (b) any merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Corporation and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Corporation Common Stock solely into Common Shares of the surviving entity in such merger);
 
provided
,
however
, that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred if either (a) the closing price per share of the Series 1 Common Stock for any five Trading Days within the period of 10 consecutive Trading Days ending immediately after the later of the Change of Control or the public announcement of the Change of Control (in the case of a Change of Control under clause (x) above) or ending immediately before the Change of Control (in the
33
case of a Change of Control under clause (y) above) shall equal or exceed 105% of the effective conversion price in effect on each such Trading Day (i.e., the Liquidation Preference on such Trading Day, divided by the Conversion Rate in effect on such Trading Day), or (b) all of the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares) in the transaction or transactions constituting the Change of Control consists of Common Shares (or equivalent securities) traded on a national or regional securities exchange or quoted on the NNM and as a result of such transaction or transactions the Ninth Series becomes convertible solely into such Common Shares (or equivalent securities).
 
Beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Commission under the Exchange Act.
 
(ii) Within 30 days after the occurrence of any Change of Control, the Corporation shall mail a notice (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to each Holder (the Change of Control Corporation Notice) with a copy to the Transfer Agent stating that a Change of Control has occurred and that a special tender right has arisen as a result thereof.
 
(iii) (A) If a Change of Control occurs, the Corporation shall be required to make an offer (a Change of Control Offer) to each Holder to acquire any or all of such Holders shares of the Ninth Series on a date (an Acquisition Date) that is not more than 45 days after the date of the Change of Control at a tender price equal to the Liquidation Preference thereof on the Acquisition Date. The Corporation may, at its option, in lieu of paying the tender price in cash, pay the tender price or a portion thereof in Series 1 Common Stock or in a combination of cash and Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(B) To exercise the special tender right set forth in subparagraph (g)(iii)(A), a Holder must deliver on or before the 30th day after the date of the Change of Control Corporation Notice written notice to the Transfer Agent of the Holders exercise of such right, together with, in the case of shares of the Ninth Series held in definitive form, the Ninth Series certificates with respect to which the right is being exercised. In the case of shares of the Ninth Series held in book entry form, the applicable procedures of the depositary for the shares of Ninth Series with respect to redemption of shares by an issuer will apply. Any such notice by the Holder may be withdrawn by the Holder by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Transfer Agent prior to the close of business on the Acquisition Date. The notice of withdrawal shall state the number of shares of the Ninth Series and the certificate numbers of the Ninth Series certificates as to which the withdrawal notice relates and the number of shares, if any, which remain subject to the Holders notice of exercise.
 
(C) With respect to any Change of Control, the Change of Control Corporation Notice shall also specify (w) the tender price and the purchase date, which shall be 45 days after the date of the Change of Control Corporation Notice; (x) that the Liquidation Preference of any shares of the Ninth Series not tendered or converted will continue to accrete in accordance with the terms hereof; (y) that, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the tender price, the Liquidation Preference of all shares of the Ninth Series accepted for payment pursuant to this paragraph (g) shall cease to accrete on and after the Acquisition Date and all rights of the Holders accepted for payment shall terminate on and after the Acquisition Date and (z) a description of the procedures to be followed by such Holder in order to have its shares of the Ninth Series repurchased.
(D) On the Acquisition Date, the Corporation shall, to the extent lawful, (1) accept for payment shares of the Ninth Series tendered pursuant to this paragraph (g) and (2) promptly mail to each Holder of Ninth Series so accepted payment in an amount equal to the tender price for such shares and, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment for the shares of the Ninth Series tendered pursuant to this paragraph (g), the Liquidation Preference shall cease to accrete with respect to the shares of the Ninth Series tendered and all rights of Holders of such tendered shares shall terminate, except for the right to receive payment therefor, on the Acquisition Date. The Corporation shall publicly announce the results of its Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Acquisition Date.
 
(iv) (A) The Corporation shall comply with Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act and any securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable to the repurchase of shares of the Ninth Series in connection with a Change of Control.
 
34
(B) In the event the Corporation elects to pay all or a portion of the tender price in Series 1 Common Stock, upon determination of the actual number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock to be paid in lieu of cash in accordance with paragraph (h), the Corporation will publicly announce such determination and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission containing the information in such public announcement.
 
(C) If the Transfer Agent holds money or securities sufficient to pay the tender price on the Business Day following the Acquisition Date, then, on and after the Acquisition Date, each share of the Ninth Series tendered to the Corporation will cease to be outstanding and the Liquidation Preference thereon shall cease to accrete whether or not book-entry transfer of such Ninth Series is made or such Ninth Series is delivered to the Transfer Agent, and all other rights of the Holder thereof shall terminate (other than the right to receive the tender price, without interest, upon book-entry transfer or delivery of the Ninth Series certificate).
 
(D) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (g), the Corporation shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this paragraph (g) applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Corporation and purchases all shares of the Ninth Series validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to this paragraph (g).
 
(h)
Payments in Series 1 Common Stock
. (i) If the Corporation elects to pay any redemption price or tender price, in whole or in part, in Series 1 Common Stock, the number of shares to be delivered in respect of the portion of such redemption price or tender price to be paid in Series 1 Common Stock shall be equal to such portion of the redemption price or tender price divided by the Market Price of the Series 1 Common Stock. No fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock will be delivered upon any acquisition of Ninth Series by the Corporation through the delivery of Series 1 Common Stock in payment, in whole or in part, of the redemption price or tender price. Instead, the Corporation, at its option, will either round up to full shares or pay cash based on the Market Price for all fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock. The Corporation may elect to pay the redemption price or tender price in Series 1 Common Stock only if the Series 1 Common Stock is listed on a United States national or regional stock exchange or quoted by the NNM.
 
(ii) At least 23 Trading Days prior to any Redemption Date or Acquisition Date, the Corporation must give notice (a Corporation Notice) to the Holders of its intention to pay the redemption price or tender price, or any portion thereof, in Series 1 Common Stock (specifying the percentage thereof). Upon determination of the actual number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Corporation will publicly announce such determination and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission containing the information in such public announcement.
 
(iii) The Corporations right to pay the redemption price or tender price (or a portion thereof) in Series 1 Common Stock is subject to: (1) the delivery by the Corporation of a timely Corporation Notice of its election to purchase all or a specified percentage of the Ninth Series with Series 1 Common Stock as provided herein; (2) the registration of resales of the Series 1 Common Stock under the Securities Act, if required for the Series 1 Common Stock to be freely tradeable (assuming the Holder thereof is not an Affiliate of the Corporation); (3) the issuance of such Series 1 Common Stock being in compliance with other applicable federal and state securities laws, if any; and (4) the receipt by the Transfer Agent of an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel each stating that (A) the terms of the issuance of the Series 1 Common Stock are in conformity with the terms hereof and (B) the shares of Series 1 Common Stock to be issued by the Corporation in payment of the specified percentage of the tender price or redemption price have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered pursuant to the terms hereof in payment of the tender price or redemption price, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and, in the case of such officers certificate, stating that conditions (1), (2) and (3) above have been satisfied (and setting forth the Sale Price of a share of Series 1 Common Stock on each Trading Day during the period during which the Market Price is calculated and ending on the Acquisition Date or Redemption Date as applicable) and, in the case of such opinion of counsel, stating that conditions (2) and (3) above have been satisfied.
 
If such conditions are not satisfied by the applicable Acquisition Date or Redemption Date, the Corporation will pay the tender price or redemption price on such Acquisition Date or Redemption Date entirely in cash (except as provided in paragraph (g)).
 
35
(i)
Conversion
. (i) A Holder may convert its shares of the Ninth Series into Series 1 Common Stock and cash (as provided below), unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at any time prior to the close of business on December 23, 2013;
provided
that if a share of the Ninth Series is called for redemption, the Holder may convert it only until the close of business on the applicable Redemption Date unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price. Shares of the Ninth Series which a Holder has tendered for acquisition by the Corporation or, as described in paragraph (g), a third party acquiror pursuant to an offer to acquire, may be converted only if such Ninth Series is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of such offer.
 
Each share of the Ninth Series will initially be convertible into (a) shares of Series 1 Common Stock at an initial Conversion Rate (the Conversion Rate) equal to the product of (1) the conversion rate in effect with respect to the Nextel Communications, Inc. Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger times (2) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock into which each share of Nextel Class A common stock is converted pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, as described below, and (b) an amount in cash (the Merger Cash) equal to the product of (1) the conversion rate in effect with respect to the Nextel Communications, Inc. Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger times (2) the amount of cash (if any) into which each share of Nextel Class A common stock is converted pursuant to the Merger Agreement (excluding any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares). As promptly as practicable on or after the Conversion Date, the Corporation will (x) issue and deliver to the Transfer Agent a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion, with any fractional shares rounded up to full shares or, at the Corporations option, paid in cash in lieu of any fraction of a share, based on the Sale Price of the Series 1 Common Stock on the Trading Day preceding the Conversion Date and (y) deliver to the Transfer Agent the amount of Merger Cash (if any) payable upon conversion. In addition, if a Holder elects to convert, the Corporation will pay to such Holder, contemporaneously with the delivery of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion, the sum of $30.00 per share of Ninth Series (the Special Dividend).
 
(ii) The Corporations delivery to the Holder of (x) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock into which the Ninth Series is convertible (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock), (y) the amount of Merger Cash (if any) into which the Ninth Series is convertible and (z) the Special Dividend will be deemed to satisfy the Corporations obligation to pay the Liquidation Preference on the Ninth Series.
 
(iii) To convert certificated Ninth Series into Series 1 Common Stock and Merger Cash, a Holder must (i) complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the Ninth Series certificate (or complete and manually sign a facsimile thereof) and deliver such notice to the Transfer Agent, (ii) surrender the Ninth Series certificate to the Transfer Agent, (iii) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and (iv) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes. The date on which all of the foregoing requirements have been satisfied is the Conversion Date.
 
(iv) All shares of Series 1 Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Ninth Series shall be validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
(v) The Conversion Rate shall be subject to adjustments from time to time as follows:
 
(A) If the Corporation shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution in Series 1 Common Stock to all holders of any outstanding Series 1 Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined in subparagraph (viii) below) fixed for such dividend or distribution and of which the numerator shall be the sum of such number of outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock and the total number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this subparagraph (v)(A) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate
36
shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(B) If the Corporation shall offer or issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its outstanding Series 1 Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Series 1 Common Stock at a price per share less than the average market price (determined as provided in subparagraph (viii) below) on the Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date after such Record Date by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) at the close of business on the Record Date plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock which the aggregate subscription or purchase price of the total number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock subject to such rights, options or warrants would purchase at such average market price and of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) at the close of business on the Record Date plus the total number of additional shares of Series 1 Common Stock subject to such rights, options or warrants for subscription or purchase. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to purchase or receive such rights, options or warrants. To the extent that shares of Series 1 Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights, options or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights, options or warrants the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase Series 1 Common Stock at less than such average market price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Series 1 Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, options or warrants, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. In lieu of the foregoing adjustment the Corporation may make adequate provision so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a share of the Ninth Series (or any portion thereof) the amount of such rights, options or warrants such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such share of the Ninth Series (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date.
 
(C) If the outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased and, conversely, if the outstanding shares of Series 1 Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
(D) In case the Corporation shall issue any Series 1 Common Stock or Right (as defined in subparagraph (viii) below) (excluding (i) any Right issued in any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (v)(A) or (v)(B) above, (ii) Series 1 Common Stock issued pursuant to (x) any Rights outstanding on the Effective Date or (y) a Right, if on the date such Right was issued, the exercise, conversion or exchange price per share of Series 1 Common Stock with respect thereto was at least equal to the then average market price of the Series 1 Common Stock and (iii) any Series 1 Common Stock or Right issued as consideration when any corporation or business is acquired, merged into or becomes part of the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation in an arms-length transaction between the Corporation and another Person approved by the Board of Directors and, if such Person is an Affiliate of the Corporation, approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors who are neither (A) officers or employees of the Corporation nor (B) Affiliates of such other Person) at a price per share of Series 1 Common Stock
37
(determined in the case of any such Right, by dividing (x) the total consideration receivable by the Corporation in consideration of the sale and issuance of such Right, plus the total consideration payable to the Corporation upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (y) the total number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock covered by such Right) that is lower than the average market price per share of Series 1 Common Stock in effect immediately prior to such sale or issuance, then the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock thereafter issuable upon conversion of each share of the Ninth Series shall be determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) immediately after such sale or issuance and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding (including the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation) immediately prior to such sale or issuance plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received (determined as provided below) for such sale or issuance would purchase at such average market price per share of Series 1 Common Stock. For purposes of this subparagraph (v)(D), the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock which the holder of any such Right shall be entitled to subscribe for or purchase shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding as of the date of such sale and issuance and the consideration received by the Corporation therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the Corporation for such Right, plus the consideration or premiums stated in such Right to be paid for the Series 1 Common Stock covered thereby. In case the Corporation shall sell and issue Series 1 Common Stock or any Right for a consideration consisting, in whole or in part, of property other than cash or its equivalent, then in determining the price per share of Series 1 Common Stock and the consideration received by the Corporation for purposes of the first sentence of this subparagraph (v)(D), the Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith, the fair value of said property, which determination shall be evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors. In case the Corporation shall sell and issue any Right together with one or more other securities as part of a unit at a price per unit, then in determining the price per share of Series 1 Common Stock and the consideration received by the Corporation for purposes of the first sentence of this subparagraph (v)(D), the Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith, the fair value of the Right then being sold as part of such unit.
 
(E) If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Series 1 Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of any class of capital stock, or other property (including securities, but excluding (i) any rights, options or warrants referred to in subparagraph (v)(B) of this paragraph (i), (ii) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and (iii) any dividend or distribution referred to in subparagraph (v)(A) of this paragraph (i), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Record Date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the average market price per share of the Series 1 Common Stock on such Record Date less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) of the portion of the assets, shares or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Series 1 Common Stock and the numerator shall be such average market price per share of the Series 1 Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date;
provided
,
however
, that, in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the distributed assets or securities applicable to one share of Series 1 Common Stock is equal to or greater than the average market price of the Series 1 Common Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a share of the Ninth Series (or any portion thereof) the amount of distributed assets or securities such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such share of the Ninth Series (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this subparagraph (E) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities comprising such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average market price per share pursuant to subparagraph (viii)(A).
 
38
(F) If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, make a Cash Distribution in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (1) the aggregate amount of any other Cash Distributions made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such current Cash Distribution in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (v)(F) or subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made and (2) the aggregate amount of any Excess Purchase Payments made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such current Cash Distribution in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (v)(F) or subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made, exceeds 10% of the Corporations Market Capitalization on the Record Date for such current Cash Distribution (the amount of such excess being the Distribution Excess Amount), then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on the Record Date for such current Cash Distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on such Record Date by a fraction (I) the denominator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such Record Date less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the Distribution Excess Amount divided by (y) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding on such Record Date plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding on such Record Date and (II) the numerator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such Record Date. If such current Cash Distribution is not made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such current Cash Distribution had not been declared.
 
(G) If the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall make Excess Purchase Payments with respect to any tender offer in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (1) the aggregate amount of any other Excess Purchase Payments made within the 12 months preceding such current Excess Purchase Payment in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to subparagraph (v)(F) or this subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made and (2) the aggregate amount of any Cash Distributions made within the 12 months preceding such current Excess Purchase Payment in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to subparagraph (v)(F) or this subparagraph (v)(G) has been previously made, exceeds 10% of the Corporations Market Capitalization as of the Expiration Date for such tender offer (the amount of such excess being the Tender Excess Amount), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the Expiration Date, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business on the Expiration Date by a fraction (I) the denominator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the Expiration Date less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the Tender Excess Amount divided by (y) the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock outstanding on such Expiration Date plus the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding on such Expiration Date (but excluding any shares purchased in such tender offer) and (II) the numerator of which shall be equal to the average Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the Expiration Date. If the Corporation is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Corporation is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made.
 
(vi) No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such rate then in effect;
provided
,
however
, that any adjustments that would otherwise be required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Except as stated above, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Series 1 Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Series 1 Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing. All calculations under subparagraph (i)(v) shall be made by the Corporation and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value of the Series 1 Common Stock.
 
(vii) The Corporation will provide to the Holders reasonable notice (which obligation may be satisfied by means of a public announcement and the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Commission containing the information in such public announcement) of any event that would result in an adjustment to
39
the Conversion Rate pursuant to this paragraph (i) so as to permit the Holders to effect a conversion of Ninth Series into shares of Series 1 Common Stock prior to the occurrence of such event.
 
(viii) For purposes of this paragraph (i), the following terms shall have the meaning indicated:
 
(A) average market price means the average of the daily Sale Prices per share of Series 1 Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to the date in question.
 
(B) Cash Distribution means the distribution by the Corporation to all holders of its Series 1 Common Stock of cash (excluding any cash that is part of a distribution referred to in subparagraph (v)(E) or cash distributed upon a merger or consolidation described in subparagraph (i)(xii)).

Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Corporation shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment is effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder at such Holders last address appearing on the register of Holders maintained by the Transfer Agent within 20 days of the effective date of such adjustment.

Mandatory Conversion
. (i) At any time, if the Corporation reasonably believes that any shares of the Ninth Series are held by or on account of a Non-U.S. Holder, such Ninth Series will be subject to mandatory conversion (a
Mandatory Conversion), at the option of the Corporation, upon written notice (a Mandatory Conversion Notice) to such Non-U.S. Holder. In addition, upon any (x) optional redemption by the Corporation of a Holders shares of the Ninth Series, (y) tender by a Holder of any of such Holders shares of the Ninth Series for acquisition thereof by the Corporation, or (z) exercise by a Holder of any of its conversion rights, the Corporation reasonably believes that any such Holder is a Non-U. S. Holder, the shares of the Ninth Series held by such Holder will be subject to Mandatory Conversion, and such Mandatory Conversion will preempt any conversion or tender rights that any such Non-U.S. Holder would otherwise have in respect of its shares of the Ninth Series.
 
41
(ii) The Mandatory Conversion Notice will be mailed to the Non-U.S. Holders address as it appears on the stock transfer records of Holders maintained by the Transfer Agent and shall specify the number of the shares of the Ninth Series subject to such notice, the certificate numbers of such shares (if such shares are held in certificated form by such Non-U.S. Holder) and the basis for the Corporations belief that any such Holder is a Non-U.S. Holder. Such Holders shares of the Ninth Series will be deemed to have been converted as of the date of the Mandatory Conversion Notice unless such Holder has established within 10 days after the date of any such notice by written documentation or other evidence to the Corporations reasonable satisfaction that it is a U.S. Holder.
 
(iii) The Corporation will (i) issue and deliver to the Transfer Agent a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock issuable upon the Mandatory Conversion, with any fractional shares rounded up to full shares or, at the Corporations option, paid in cash in lieu of any fraction of a share, based on the Sale Price of the Series 1 Common Stock on the Trading Day preceding the applicable Mandatory Conversion Notice, and (ii) deliver to the Transfer Agent cash in an amount equal to the Merger Cash (if any) payable upon Mandatory Conversion. Any Mandatory Conversion will be conducted in accordance with the conversion procedures described under paragraph (i). The Corporations delivery to the Holder of the number of shares of Series 1 Common Stock and the amount of Merger Cash (if any) into which such Holders shares of the Ninth Series are convertible hereunder (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock, if any) will be deemed to satisfy the Corporations obligation to pay the Liquidation Preference on the Ninth Series to the applicable Conversion Date.
 
(iv) If the Transfer Agent holds, in accordance herewith, Series 1 Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Series 1 Common Stock, if any) sufficient to pay the conversion price and the amount of Merger Cash (if any) payable upon conversion on the date of the Mandatory Conversion Notice with respect to any shares of the Ninth Series, then, on and after such date, such shares of the Ninth Series will cease to be outstanding and the Liquidation Preference thereon shall cease to accrete whether or not book-entry transfer of such Ninth Series is made or such Ninth Series is delivered to the Transfer Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Series 1 Common Stock, Merger Cash, if any, and cash, if any, for fractional shares upon delivery of the Ninth Series certificate or book-entry transfer of such shares of the Ninth Series to the Transfer Agent).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of the Ninth Series, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any shares of the Ninth Series held by a non-consenting Holder): (A) alter the voting rights with respect to the Ninth Series or reduce the number of shares of the Ninth Series whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the terms of the Ninth Series, (B) reduce the amount of or rate of accretion of the Liquidation Preference of any share of the Ninth Series or adversely alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Ninth Series, or make any change that adversely affects the right to convert the Ninth Series or the right to require the Corporation to purchase the Ninth Series, (C) make any share of the Ninth Series payable in money other than United States dollars, (D) make any change in the provisions of this Section 10.8 relating to waivers of the rights of Holders to receive the Liquidation Preference on the Ninth Series or (E) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
 
(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Corporation may (to the extent permitted by Kansas law) amend or supplement this Section 10.8 to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated shares of the Ninth Series in addition to or in place of certificated shares of the Ninth Series or to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or to make any change that the Board of Directors determines, in good faith, is not materially adverse to the Holders.
