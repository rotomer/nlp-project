SPRINT NEXTEL REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2012
RESULTS AND UPDATES FULL YEAR FORECAST
The company's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call will be held at 8 a.m. ET today. Participants may dial 800-938-1120 in the U.S. or Canada (706-634-7849 internationally) and provide the following ID: 83798759 or may listen via the Internet at www.sprint.com/investors.
OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - July 26, 2012 - Sprint Nextel Corp. (NYSE: S)
today reported a net loss of $1.4 billion and a diluted net loss of $.46 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to a net loss of $847 million and a diluted net loss of $.28 per share in the second quarter of 2011. Sprint's second quarter 2012 results include accelerated depreciation of $782 million, or negative $.26 per share (pre-tax), primarily related to Network Vision, including the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform; $184 million, or negative $.06 per share (pre-tax), for the recognition of lease exit costs for the remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel sites shut down; and an impairment of $204 million, or negative $.07 per share (pre-tax), related to Sprint's investment in Clearwire.
The company reported wireless service revenues of $7.3 billion during the quarter, an increase of more than 8 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by Sprint platform postpaid ARPU growth of $4.31 - the largest quarterly year-over-year increase on record for the U.S. wireless industry.
1
Sprint platform postpaid net additions of 442,000 improved by 68 percent sequentially driven by best ever quarterly churn performance of 1.69 percent, a Nextel postpaid recapture rate of 60 percent and the continued strength of iPhone
sales. Sprint recorded nearly 1.5 million iPhone sales in the second quarter with 40 percent going to new postpaid customers.
The Sprint platform achieved best ever postpaid ARPU and customer churn that, combined with disciplined customer acquisition and cost management, contributed to our Adjusted OIBDA* of $1.45 billion, said Dan Hesse, Sprint CEO. Based on this performance, we are raising the 2012 Adjusted OIBDA* forecast to between $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion.
NETWORK VISION HIGHLIGHTS
Sprint's Network Vision initiative remains on track. The company has taken 9,600 Nextel sites off air to date - earlier than previous guidance. To date, the company has completed leasing agreements for more than 12,700 Network Vision sites and zoning requirements are completed for nearly 13,900 sites. In addition, nearly 6,300 sites are either ready for construction or already underway and more than 2,000 sites are on air and meeting speed and coverage enhancement targets. Sprint expects to bring 12,000 sites on air by the end of 2012 and to complete the majority of its Network Vision roll-out by the end of 2013.
As part of Network Vision, Sprint launched 4G LTE in five major markets and 15 cities on July 15 including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta and Kansas City.
Sprint launched its first four 4G LTE smartphones during the second quarter - Galaxy Nexus, LG Viper 4G LTE, HTC EVO 4G LTE and Samsung Galaxy S
III. Sprint also significantly expanded the coverage area of its Sprint Direct Connect push-to-talk service with the addition of roaming and Sprint 1xRTT coverage areas.
LIQUIDITY
During the second quarter, Sprint entered into a new $1 billion secured credit facility contingent on equipment-related purchases from Ericsson for Network Vision with a cost of funding of approximately 6 percent based on expected drawdowns. This followed debt offerings of $2 billion raised in the first quarter of 2012 and $4 billion raised in the fourth quarter of 2011 to help fund the Network Vision deployment, debt maturities and working capital requirements. The company also retired $1 billion of 2013 debt maturities during the quarter. Sprint's next scheduled debt maturities include $300 million due in May 2013 and $473 million due in October 2013. As of June 30, 2012, the company's liquidity was approximately $8 billion consisting of $6.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity available under its revolving bank credit facility. Additionally, the company had $1 billion of undrawn availability under the equipment financing credit facility. Sprint generated
$1.2 billion of net cash provided by operating activities and $209 million of Free Cash Flow* in the quarter.
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND BRAND HIGHLIGHTS
Sprint's leading customer experience continued to garner third-party accolades. In particular, the American Customer Satisfaction Index ranked Sprint number one among all national carriers in customer satisfaction and most improved, across all 47 industries, over the last four years. Sprint is the only U.S. company to go from last place to first place in its industry during this time. Sprint was the only telecom provider ranked in the top 50 by the Environmental Protection Agency Green Power Partners Fortune 500 list and for the third consecutive year Sprint won the International Electronics Recycling Conference and Expo Sustainability Leadership Award.
In addition to the new 4G LTE device launches, Sprint continued to strengthen its portfolio of products and services during the second quarter. Sprint's Virgin Mobile USA brand began offering the iPhone to prepaid customers. Virgin Mobile also launched HTC EVO V 4G and Boost Mobile launched HTC EVO Design 4G bringing the combination of 4G WiMax and the award-winning EVO family of devices to prepaid customers. Sprint also announced Sprint Wholesale Cloud Services, a unique combination of platform services, a full suite of enablement applications and one-on-one support for wireless resellers. Additionally, earlier this month Sprint announced an exclusive relationship with CSC to deliver cloud computing, cloud-based email, managed hosting and co-location services in the U.S. to commercial customers. The company also introduced Sprint Guardian, a collection of mobile safety and device security bundles that provide families relevant tools to help stay safe and secure.

Results include pre-tax, non-cash "Equity in losses of unconsolidated investments and other, net" of $398 million ($.13 per share), $273 million ($.09 per share) and $671 million ($.22 per share) in the second and first quarters and year-to-date periods of 2012, respectively, and $588 million ($.20 per share) and $1.0 billion ($.33 per share) in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2011.
(2)

(3)
The second quarter 2012 includes a non-cash impairment of $204 million to reflect a reduction of our investment in Clearwire to its estimated fair value.
(4)
For the second quarter 2012, lease exit costs are primarily associated with the shutdown of Nextel platform sites.
(5)
For the first quarter 2012, gains from asset dispositions and exchanges are primarily due to spectrum exchange transactions.
(6)
For the first quarter 2012, asset impairments and abandonments relate to a change in our backhaul architecture in connection to our Network Vision design from microwave to a more cost effective fiber backhaul.
(7)
On March 16, 2012, we elected to terminate the arrangement with LightSquared LP and LightSquared, Inc. (LightSquared). As we have no future service obligations with respect to the arrangement with LightSquared, we recognized $236 million of the advanced payments as other operating income in the first quarter of 2012. As a result of the termination of the hosting agreement, we impaired capitalized costs specific to LightSquared's 1.6 GHz spectrum that the Company no longer intends to deploy which totaled $66 million.
(8)
Favorable developments during the first quarter of 2012 relating to disagreements with local exchange carriers resulted in a reduction in expected access costs of $17 million.

*FINANCIAL MEASURES
Sprint Nextel provides financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and adjusted GAAP (non-GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures reflect industry conventions, or standard measures of liquidity, profitability or performance commonly used by the investment community for comparability purposes. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have defined below each of the non-GAAP measures we use, but these measures may not be synonymous to similar measurement terms used by other companies.
Sprint Nextel provides reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures in its financial reporting. Because Sprint Nextel does not predict special items that might occur in the future, and our forecasts are developed at a level of detail different than that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures, Sprint Nextel does not provide reconciliations to GAAP of its forward-looking financial measures.
The measures used in this release include the following:
OIBDA
is operating income/(loss) before depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted OIBDA
is
OIBDA
excluding severance, exit costs, and other special items.
Adjusted OIBDA Margin
represents Adjusted OIBDA divided by non-equipment net operating revenues for Wireless and Adjusted OIBDA divided by net operating revenues for Wireline. We believe that Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide useful information to investors because they are an indicator of the strength and performance of our ongoing business operations, including our ability to fund discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, spectrum acquisitions and other investments and our ability to incur and service debt. While depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under GAAP, these expenses primarily represent non-cash current period costs associated with the use of long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin are calculations commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare the periodic and future operating performance and value of companies within the telecommunications industry.
Free Cash Flow
is the cash provided by operating activities less the cash used in investing activities other than short-term investments and equity method investments during the period. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors, analysts and our management about the cash generated by our core operations after interest and dividends, if any, and our ability to fund scheduled debt maturities and other financing activities, including discretionary refinancing and retirement of debt and purchase or sale of investments.
Net Debt
is consolidated debt, including current maturities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and if any, restricted cash. We believe that Net Debt provides useful information to investors, analysts and credit rating agencies about the capacity of the company to reduce the debt load and improve its capital structure.

SAFE HARBOR
This release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. The words may, could, should, estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, anticipate, believe, target, plan, providing guidance, and similar expressions are intended to identify information that is not historical in nature. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future - including statements relating to network performance, subscriber growth, and liquidity, and statements expressing general views about future operating results - are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting management's judgment based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. With respect to these forward-looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, development and deployment of new technologies; efficiencies and cost savings of multimode technologies; customer and network usage; customer growth and retention; service, coverage and quality; availability of devices; the timing of various events and the economic environment. Sprint Nextel believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and speak only as of the date when made. Sprint Nextel undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our company's historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are incorporated herein by reference and when filed, Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.
Clearwire's second quarter 2012 results from operations have not yet been finalized. As a result, the amount reflected for Sprint's share of Clearwire's results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, is an estimate and, based upon the finalization of Clearwire's results, may need to be revised if our estimate materially differs from Clearwire's actual results. Changes in our estimate, if any, would affect the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire, net loss, basic and diluted net loss per common share, and comprehensive loss but would have no effect on Sprint's operating income, OIBDA*, Adjusted OIBDA* or consolidated statement of cash flows.
