Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and upon the terms and subject to the conditions described therein, each outstanding share of Series 1 common stock, $2.00 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than shares cancelled and retired at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or held by Parent and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted at the Effective Time into either (i) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock for which an election to receive cash has been effectively made, subject to the election and allocation procedures in the Merger Agreement, cash in an amount equal to $7.30 (subject to proration), (ii) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock for which an election to receive common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") has been effectively made, one share of Parent Common Stock (subject to proration), or (iii) with respect to shares of Company Common Stock for which no election to receive cash or Parent Common Stock has been effectively made, either (x) cash in an amount equal to $7.30, (y) one share of Parent Common Stock or (z) a combination of cash and a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). Immediately following the Merger, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, it is expected that HoldCo will hold shares of Parent Common Stock representing approximately 69.642% of the fully-diluted equity of Parent (excluding shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant contemplated by the Warrant Agreement discussed below), and the former stockholders and other former equityholders of the Company will hold, collectively, shares of Parent Common Stock and other equity securities of Parent collectively representing approximately 30.358% of the fully-diluted equity of Parent (excluding shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant contemplated by the Warrant Agreement discussed below). The exchanges for Parent Common Stock that occur pursuant to the Merger, taken together, are expected to constitute exchanges described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
At or prior to the Effective Time, SoftBank will cause HoldCo (i) to contribute to Parent not less than $17.04 billion (of which amount $12.14 billion will be paid to the Company's stockholders as part of the Merger Consideration and $4.9 billion will remain in the cash balances of Parent following the Effective Time) and (ii) to enter into a Warrant Agreement with Parent substantially in the form attached to the Merger Agreement (the "Warrant Agreement"). Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, for a period of five years after the Effective Date, HoldCo will have the right to purchase up to 54,579,924 shares of Parent Common Stock for a price of $5.25 per share.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement. The consummation of the Merger is also subject to the performance of covenants and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, including, among other things, (i) the effectiveness of the registration statement for the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, and the approval of the listing of such shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), (ii) receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including approvals of the Federal Communications Commission, applicable state public utility commissions, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and certain applicable non-U.S. competition laws, favorable completion of review by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States ("CFIUS") and the approval by the Defense Security Services of a plan to operate the business of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to a foreign ownership, control or influence ("FOCI") mitigation plan, and (iii) no material adverse effect with respect to the Company since the date of the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants customary for a transaction of this nature. The Company is subject to restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals and to provide information to, and engage in discussion with, third parties regarding such proposals, except under limited circumstances to permit the Company's board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances (including in connection with a superior offer), the Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $600 million to Parent. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Company's stockholders do not approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, and prior to such termination certain triggering events described in the Merger Agreement have not occurred, then the Company may be required to reimburse Parent for its fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement up to $75 million. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances (including failure of Parent to obtain financing), Parent may be required to pay a reverse termination fee of $600 million to the Company.
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, the Parent board of directors will consist of ten members, comprising six directors appointed by SoftBank (of which six members, three will be independent directors under the listing standards of the NYSE), three independent directors selected from the Company's board of directors immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Company's chief executive officer.
The representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of SoftBank, HoldCo, Parent and Merger Sub. In addition, such representations and warranties (A) have been made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement, (B) have been qualified by documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by the Company on or after January 1, 2012 and prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, (C) have been qualified by confidential disclosures made to SoftBank, HoldCo, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger Agreement, (D) are subject to materiality qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement, which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors, (E) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement and (F) have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the contracting parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding the Company or its business. Investors should not rely on the
representations and warranties or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Company that has been, is or will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, Forms 8-K, proxy statements, registration statements and other documents that the Company files with the SEC.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Bond Purchase Agreement
In connection with the Merger Agreement, on October 15, 2012, the Company entered into a Bond Purchase Agreement (the "Bond Purchase Agreement") with Parent pursuant to which Parent has agreed to purchase from the Company a Bond (the "Bond") in the principal amount of $3.1 billion, which Bond is convertible, subject to the provisions of the Bond Purchase Agreement, into an aggregate of 590,476,190 shares of Company Common Stock, or approximately 19.65% of the current outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (pre-conversion), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Bond Purchase Agreement. If not earlier converted, principal and any accrued but unpaid interest under the Bond will be due and payable on October 15, 2019. The principal balance of the Bond will bear interest at 1.0% per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, beginning on April 15, 2013.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Bond will be converted into shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bond Purchase Agreement, and the Bond may not otherwise be converted prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement without consummation of the Merger. Parent may convert the Bond into Company Common Stock at any time after the termination of the Merger Agreement without consummation of the Merger. Conversion of the Bond is subject in any case to receipt of any required approvals and, subject to certain exceptions, to receipt of waivers under the Company's existing credit facilities.
The Company has agreed to certain registration rights with respect to the Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Bond. Subject to certain exceptions, Parent may not transfer the Bond without the Company's consent.
Upon conversion of the Bond in full, and for so long as Parent and its affiliates hold (i) at least 10% of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, Parent shall have the right to designate two members of the Company's board of directors or (ii) less than 10%, but at least 5%, of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, Parent shall have the right to designate one member of the Company's board of directors, provided the Merger Agreement has been terminated without consummation of the Merger. The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to facilitate the appointment of the individuals designated by Parent to be elected as a member of the Company's board of directors. Parent's right to designate members of the Company's board of directors will terminate if Parent sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Company Common Stock received upon conversion of the Bond.
The closing of the purchase and sale of the Bond under the Bond Purchase Agreement is expected to occur on or before October 24, 2012, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein. If such conditions are satisfied, and Parent fails to purchase the Bond pursuant to the terms of the Bond Purchase Agreement on or prior to October 24, 2012, subject to certain conditions, the Company will have the right to terminate the Bond Purchase Agreement and also the Merger Agreement. In addition to the foregoing termination right, the Bond Purchase Agreement will terminate pursuant to its terms if the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated under the Bond Purchase Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Bond Purchase Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bond Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4(i) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the dividend or distribution date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the effective date in the case of such subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be. In the event that, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4(i), the Holder is entitled to receive any shares of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions contained in this Section 4 with respect to the Common Stock.
Subdivisions, Combinations and Dividends
(ii) . If any reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, by merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise, is effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive stock, securities, or other assets or property, then, as a condition of such reclassification, lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby the Holder shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive (in lieu of the shares of Common Stock purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such reclassification) such shares of stock, securities or other assets or property as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares of such Common Stock purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such reclassification. If the Company is acquired in an all cash transaction, the Holder shall thereafter have the right to receive cash equal to the value of the Warrant Shares issuable upon a cashless exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to the closing of such transaction. In any reclassification described above, appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder such that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustments of the Stock Purchase Price and of the number of shares purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall continue to apply in relation to any shares of stock, or other securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof.
Reclassification
(iii) . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, distributes to all holders of Common Stock for no consideration (w) evidences of its indebtedness, (x) any security (other than a distribution of Common Stock covered by the preceding paragraphs), (y) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security, or (z) any other asset, including cash (in each case, ""), then, upon any exercise of this Warrant that occurs after the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, the Holder shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the Warrant Shares otherwise issuable upon such exercise (if applicable), the Distributed Property that such Holder

would have been entitled to receive in respect of such number of Warrant Shares had the Holder been the record holder of such Warrant Shares immediately prior to such record date.
(iv) . Upon any adjustment of the Stock Purchase Price or any increase or decrease in the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall give, as promptly as possible, written notice thereof, by first class mail postage prepaid, addressed to the registered Holder at the address of such Holder as shown on the books of the Company. The notice shall be signed by the Company's chief financial officer and shall state the Stock Purchase Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares purchasable at such price upon the exercise of this Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company acknowledges that the Holder shall be entitled to the benefit of all adjustments in the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon conversion of the Common Stock which occur prior to the exercise of this Warrant, including without limitation, any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion as a result of a dilutive issuance of capital stock.

Any notice given in accordance with the foregoing clause (b) shall also specify the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization or reclassification.
5. . Nothing contained in this Warrant shall be construed as conferring upon the Holder the right to vote or to consent to receive notice as a stockholder of the Company or any other matters or any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise of this Warrant. No dividends or interest shall be payable or accrued in respect of this Warrant or the interest represented hereby or the shares purchasable hereunder until, and only to the extent that, this Warrant is exercised.

6. . Subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, this Warrant and all rights hereunder may be transferred, in whole or in part, without charge to the Holder upon surrender of this Warrant properly endorsed.

(a) At any time after the Merger Agreement has been terminated without consummation of the Merger (the ""), upon not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice, the holder of the Bond may convert any or all of the Bond into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). If, following the Termination Event, all required regulatory approvals to the issuance of such Common Stock have not been obtained within three (3) Business Days after any notice of conversion is given by the Purchaser, the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain, and pursuant to , cooperate with the Purchaser and its Affiliates to obtain, such regulatory approvals, and the Purchaser may convert any or all of the Bond at such time as may be designated by the Purchaser after all such regulatory approvals have been obtained.

(c) The Company will pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issuance of the shares of the Common Stock upon conversion of the Bond, unless the tax is due because the holder of the Bond requests such shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name, in which case the holder will pay the tax.
(d) The Purchaser has the right to convert the Bond in whole or in part immediately prior to any repayment of the Bond.
 
(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no conversion of the Bond, in whole or in part, shall be permitted until:
(i) All required regulatory approvals for the issuance of such Common Stock have been applied for and obtained (including, in the case of conversions by the Purchaser, approval by the FCC to exceed the foreign ownership restrictions of Section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act, which approval shall be required before any conversion of the Bond will be permitted regardless of whether the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of only a portion of the Bond would cause the Purchaser's ownership to exceed such restrictions); and

No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion. Instead, the Company will pay cash in lieu of any fractional share based on the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the relevant Conversion Date.
(b) Each conversion will be deemed to have been effected as to any portion of the Bond surrendered for conversion on the Conversion Date, and with respect to the shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon such conversion, the Person in whose name the certificate or certificates for such shares will be registered will be treated as the holder of record of such shares as of the Close of Business on the Conversion Date.
(c) The Company will deliver the consideration due in respect of any conversion on the third Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date.

Conversion Rate Adjustments
(a) If the Company (i) issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on its shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides Common Stock or (iii) combines Common Stock, the Conversion Rate will be calculated based on the following formula:
 
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately prior to the Open of Business on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be;
CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the Open of Business on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately prior to the Open of Business on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be; and
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be.
Any adjustment made under this will become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the Open of Business on the effective date of such subdivision or combination of Common Stock, as the case may be. If such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination described in this is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate will be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Company's board of directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or to effect such subdivision or combination, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or such subdivision or combination had not been announced.

(b) If an Ex-Dividend Date occurs for a distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock of any rights, options or warrants entitling such holders for a period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days from the announcement date for such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock), at a price per share less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the
 
Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the announcement date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate will be calculated based on the following formula:
 
where,

X = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; and
Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the announcement date for such distribution.
divided by
Any adjustment made under this will be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and will become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, including because the distributed rights, options or warrants were not exercised, the Conversion Rate will be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the distribution of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate will be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had not occurred.
Section 10.4(b)
For purposes of this , in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the Purchaser to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price that is less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the applicable ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period, there will be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration if other than cash to be determined in good faith by the Company's board of directors.

FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company's board of directors) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property or rights, options or warrants distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock as of the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
Any adjustment made under the above portion of this will become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution. No adjustment pursuant to the above formula will result in a decrease of the Conversion Rate. However, if such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
Section 10.4(c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, the Purchaser will receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock, without having to convert its Bond, the amount and kind of the Relevant Distribution that such holder would have received if such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for the distribution.

(3) In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event of the type described in the immediately preceding clause (2) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this was made:

Section 10.4(d)
(b) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.

The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph of this will be determined on the last day of the Valuation Period but will be given effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for the Spin-Off. In respect of any conversion during the Valuation Period for any Spin-Off, references within this related to ten (10) Trading Days will be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the effective date for such Spin-Off to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date.

C = the amount in cash per share of Common Stock the Company pays, or distributes, to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock.
Any adjustment made under this will become effective immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. No adjustment pursuant to the above formula will result in a decrease of the Conversion Rate. However, if any dividend or distribution described in this is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this , in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Bond becomes convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this , references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Closing Sale Price of one share of Common Stock will be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Bond is then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph will similarly apply to successive reclassifications.

succeeding the Expiration Date. In respect of any conversion during the ten (10) Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, references within this to ten (10) Trading Days will be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date. No adjustment pursuant to the above formula will result in a decrease of the Conversion Rate.
Section 10.4(e)
(f) To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Bond, the Purchaser will receive, in addition to the Common Stock received in connection with such conversion, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of the Company's capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property as described in , subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

(h) If the Company adjusts the Conversion Rate pursuant to the above provisions, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser a certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate, detailing the calculation of the Conversion Rate and describing the facts upon which the adjustment is based.
(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will the Purchaser be permitted to convert the Bond into a number of shares of Common Stock that would result in a violation of Section 312.03(c) or (d) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual due to an increase to the Conversion Rate (the "").

Such agreement will also provide for antidilution and other adjustments that are as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments described under (it being understood that no such adjustments will be required with respect to any portion of the Reference Property that does not consist of shares of capital stock (however evidenced)).

The Company will notify the Purchaser of the weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination is made.
10.6 . The Company will at all times reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion, in accordance herewith, of the Bond (assuming, for such purposes, that at the time of computation of such number of shares, the Bond would be converted by a single holder of the Bond).
Reserved Shares
All shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Bond will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will be free of preemptive or similar rights and free of any lien or adverse claim that arises from the action or inaction of the Company.
 
The Company will comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Bond and will list such shares on each national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the shares of Common Stock are listed on the applicable Conversion Date.
11. . Other than (a) in connection with a Synthetic Sale or (b) in connection with the exercise by any lenders of the Debt Financing (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any refinancing thereof of remedies with respect to the Liens over the Securities that secures such indebtedness, the Bond may not be transferred, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company. Any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion, including in connection with a Synthetic Sale, in whole or in part, of the Bond, may be transferred as provided herein and pursuant to applicable law; , , that other than sales of shares of Common Stock pursuant to , no such transfer of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Bond may be effected (and any such transfer will be invalid) to the extent that the transferee would, immediately following such transfer, be the direct or indirect "beneficial owner," as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of more than 5% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding equity.

If the Purchase and its Affiliates beneficially own less than five percent (5%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, the Purchaser will have no director designation rights. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the Purchaser sells or otherwise disposes of its economic interest in any shares of the Common Stock received upon conversion of the Bond (including through any derivative transaction referencing such shares of Common Stock or by engaging in short sale transactions with respect to the Company's Common Stock), the Purchaser's right to designate members to the Company's board of directors pursuant to this will terminate. Any person who is to be appointed to serve on the Company's board of directors (or who is so appointed) by the Purchaser pursuant to the rights under this is a "." The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to facilitate the appointment of each Designated Director pursuant to this to be elected as members of the Company's board of directors, including, but not limited to, ensuring that the approval of the appointees is recommended by (i) the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to the board of directors and (ii) the Company's board of directors to the Company's stockholders, and to permit the Purchaser to remove, replace or change any Designated Director from time to time and fill vacancies created by reason of death, removal or resignation of such appointees, including by calling a general meeting of stockholders of the Company for the purpose of voting on any such appointment, removal, replacement or change, or, if required, to amend the Company's existing bylaws to provide for an increase in the number of directors on the Company's board of directors. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights

The indemnity obligations under this will not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, loss, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
