(e) Shares of Class A Preferred Stock shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation, and a new certificate therefor, if any, issued, upon presentation at the office of the Secretary of the Corporation (or at such additional place or places as may from time to time be designated by the Secretary of the Corporation) of the certificate, if any, for the shares, in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all requisite stock transfer tax stamps, and such documentation as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, including documentation showing compliance with this Article Fourth.
 
(f) Any person (other than a permitted transferee) who takes shares of Class A Preferred Stock in a transfer otherwise permitted by Section (B)(7) may treat the endorsement on the certificate, if any, representing such shares, or the instrument accompanying the transfer of such shares, as authorizing such person on behalf of the transferor to convert the shares in the manner provided in Section (B)(7)(a) for the purpose of registering the transfer to such person of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, and to give on behalf of the transferor the written notice of conversion required by Section (B)(7)(b), and may convert such shares of Class A Preferred Stock accordingly.
 
(g) Upon any conversion of shares of Class A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Section (B)(7), any dividend, for which the record date is prior to and the payment date is subsequent to the conversion, that has been declared on the shares of Class A Preferred Stock so converted shall be deemed to have been declared, and shall be payable, with respect to the shares of Common Stock into or for which the shares of Class A Preferred Stock are so converted, that any such dividend, for which the record date is prior to and the payment date is subsequent to the conversion, that is declared on the shares of Class A Preferred Stock payable in shares of Class A Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been declared, and shall be payable, in shares of Common Stock.
provided
 
(h) Any shares of Class A Preferred Stock that have been converted to shares of Common Stock will be retired with no further action by the Corporation, and will resume the status of authorized and unissued Class A Preferred Stock.
 
(i) The Corporation at all times shall reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, at least the number of shares of Common Stock that would become issuable upon the conversion of all shares of Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding.
 
(j) Every certificate for shares of Class A Preferred Stock shall bear a legend on its face reading as follows:
 
"The shares of Class A Preferred Stock represented by this certificate may not be transferred (which term includes, without limitation, buying a put option, selling a call option or entering into any other hedging or insurance transaction relating to the shares) to any person in connection with a transfer that does not meet the qualifications set forth in Section (B)(7) of Article Fourth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, and no person who receives the shares represented by this certificate in connection with a transfer that does not meet the qualifications prescribed by Section (B)(7) of Article Fourth is entitled to own or to be registered as the record holder of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock represented by this certificate, but the record holder of this certificate may at any time (except as provided in Section (B)(7)(a) of Article Fourth) convert the shares of Class A Preferred Stock represented by this certificate into the same number of shares of Common Stock for purposes of effecting the sale or other disposition of the shares of Class A Preferred Stock to any person. Each holder of this certificate, by accepting the certificate, accepts and agrees to all of the foregoing."

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties mutually covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities as follows:
1. CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
2. AGREEMENT TO GUARANTEE. The Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
(a) To guarantee to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, jointly and severally with the Company and any other guarantor under the Indenture, fully and unconditionally, that:

Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantor shall be obligated to pay the same immediately, jointly and severally with the Company and any other guarantor under the Indenture.
(b) The obligations hereunder shall be full and unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Guarantor.

(f) The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any other guarantor or the Company so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
(g) The Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Securities, each Holder hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee not
 
constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any bankruptcy law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of the Guarantor will, after giving effect to any maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities that are relevant under any applicable bankruptcy or fraudulent conveyance laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contributions from or payments made by or on behalf of any other guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other guarantor under the Indenture, this Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount permissible such that the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
