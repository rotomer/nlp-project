Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
MCLEAN, Va., June 3, 2010 SAIC, Inc. (NYSE: SAI), a scientific, engineering, and technology applications company, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, which ended April 30, 2010.
"We won several significant contracts during the quarter in national priority areas such as cybersecurity and logistics," said Walt Havenstein, SAIC chief executive officer. "These awards reflect the strong alignment between our strategic capabilities and our customers' missions. We improved our book-to-bill ratio considerably to 1.2, and our outlook for fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged."
Summary Operating Results
Revenues for the quarter were $2.69 billion, up 1 percent from $2.65 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Internal revenue growth contracted 1 percentage point for the quarter. Internal revenue growth was adversely affected by fewer new contract starts from lower recent bookings, and lower demand for materials on a number of programs.
Operating income for the quarter was $207 million (7.7 percent of revenue), up 1 percent from $204 million (7.7 percent of revenue) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Operating income for the quarter included a $3 million severance charge in connection with the expiration of the Scottish Power IT outsourcing contract. Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $125 million, up 7 percent from $117 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The growth in income from continuing operations was primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate as a result of the resolution of income tax uncertainties.
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the quarter were $0.32, up 10 percent from $0.29 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, driven by the increase in income from continuing operations and a lower share count compared to the prior year quarter. The diluted share count for the quarter was 378 million, down 5 percent from 397 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, due primarily to share repurchases made over the last five quarters.
Cash Generation and Capital Deployment
Cash flow provided by operations for the quarter was $138 million (or 1.1 times income from continuing operations), down 15 percent from $163 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Days sales outstanding were 69 days in the quarter, compared to 68 days in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
During the quarter, the company used $140 million to fund the acquisition of CloudShield Technologies, a leading cybersecurity and management solutions provider. Also, the company used $291 million to repurchase approximately 16.1 million shares including 14.6 million under the company's stock repurchase program and the remainder in recurring repurchases from employees in settlement of withholding taxes associated with stock option exercises and vesting events. As of April 30, 2010, the company had $568 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion in long-term debt.
Mark W. Sopp, SAIC chief financial officer commented, "We continued to manage working capital well and deployed a significant amount of cash this quarter, particularly toward share repurchases. We expect these actions will contribute to earnings growth in future quarters, while we have retained ample capacity for investment opportunities ahead."
New Business Awards
Net new business bookings totaled $3.2 billion in the first quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. Net bookings are calculated as the current period's ending backlog plus the current period's revenues less the prior period's ending backlog and less the backlog obtained in acquisitions during the period.
Large, competitive definite delivery contract awards received during the quarter include:
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, SAIC also won several indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts that are not included in net bookings. The most notable IDIQ awards during the quarter were:
 
 
 
The company's backlog of signed business orders at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $16.1 billion, of which $5.6 billion was funded. As compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, total backlog increased 3 percent and funded backlog increased 7 percent. The negotiated unfunded backlog of $10.5 billion is the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts for which funding has not been authorized and unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles.
Forward Guidance
Given its operating and business development performance through the first quarter of the fiscal year, the company expects its fiscal 2011 results to be consistent with the forward guidance provided on March 30, 2010. These expectations are:
 
 
 
These operating margin and diluted earnings per share expectations exclude the charges from the previously announced expiration of the Scottish Power IT outsourcing contract, currently estimated to be in the range of $20 to $30 million.

In this release, SAIC, Inc. refers to internal revenue growth percentage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The company calculates its internal revenue growth percentage by comparing reported revenue for the current year period to the revenue for the prior year period adjusted to include the actual revenue of acquired businesses for the comparable prior year period before acquisition. This calculation has the effect of adding revenue for the acquired businesses for the comparable prior year period to the company's prior year period reported revenue.
SAIC, Inc. uses internal revenue growth percentage as an indicator of how successful it is at growing its base business and how successful it is at growing the revenues of the businesses that it acquires. The Company believes that the integration of acquired businesses allows current management to leverage business development capabilities, drive internal resource collaboration, utilize access to markets and qualifications, and refine strategies to realize synergies, which benefits both acquired and existing businesses. As a result, the performance of the combined enterprise post-acquisition is an important measurement. In addition, as a means of rewarding the successful integration and growth of acquired businesses, and not acquisitions themselves, incentive compensation for executives and the broader employee population is based, in part, on achievement of revenue targets linked to internal revenue growth.
The limitation of this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is that internal revenue growth percentage is one of two components of the total revenue growth percentage, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The company addresses this limitation by presenting the total revenue growth percentage next to or near disclosures of internal revenue growth percentage. This financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with SAIC, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The method that the company uses to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies.
Internal revenue growth percentages for the three months ended April 30, 2010 were calculated as follows:
 
In this release, SAIC, Inc. refers to year-to-date and expectations of operating income margin improvement and growth in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations excluding charges from the expiration of the Scottish Power IT Outsourcing Contract, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The company calculates these measures by excluding those year-to-date and expected charges from operating income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Those reconciliations, which are provided below, have the impact of reducing operating margin improvement and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth.
The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with visibility to how it expects its business to perform excluding the impact of the year-to-date and expected charges arising from the expiration of the Scottish Power IT Outsourcing Contract. The limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is that the company has incurred and expects to incur charges associated with this contract expiration which are not reflected in these non-GAAP financial measures. The company addresses this limitation by presenting this reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in connection with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
