On March 11, 2011, SAIC, Inc., as borrower, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Science Applications International Corporation, as guarantor, entered into an Amended and Restated Four Year Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with a syndicate of lending institutions named in the Agreement, including Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., The Bank of Nova Scotia and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-documentation agents. The Agreement amends and restates our prior Credit Agreement, dated June 6, 2006, as amended. We had no outstanding borrowings under our prior credity facility.
The Agreement provides us with a $750 million committed borrowing facility through March 11, 2015. We have the right to request increases in the lenders' commitments up to an additional $250 million and to request extensions of the commitment termination date. We also have the right to terminate all or part of the lenders' commitments in excess of any outstanding advances, but terminated commitments may not be reinstated.
Borrowings under the Agreement are unsecured and bear interest at a rate determined, at our option, based on either a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate, in each case with an applicable margin added to the underlying rate as follows:
 
 
The applicable margin will vary based on our long-term debt ratings. Based on our current debt ratings, the applicable margin is 0.2% for base rate advances and 1.2% for Eurocurrency advances.
We will pay a facility fee on the total commitment amount, irrespective of usage, that will vary depending upon our long-term debt ratings. Based on our current ratings, the facility fee per year is 0.175% of the total commitment.
The Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, as well as certain affirmative and negative covenants. The financial covenants require that, for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2011, we maintain a ratio of consolidated funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense no less than 3.5 to 1.0. Other covenants restrict certain other of our activities, including among other things, our ability to create certain liens, dispose of substantially all of our assets and merge or consolidate with other entities.
The Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including, among others, defaults based on certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment, cross-defaults to other debt, breach of specified covenants, ERISA events, material monetary judgments, change of control events and the material inaccuracy of our representations and warranties.
To receive an extension of credit under the Agreement, we must be in compliance with the financial covenants described above, not be in default, and satisfy other customary conditions.
The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is subject to and is qualified in its entirety by reference to all of the provisions of the Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
The information described above under "Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
(iii) if any Lender failed to make a payment funding a Loan, and fails to make such payment on the Business Day following the Credit Date, the applicable Borrower shall repay such Lender's failed payment funding of such Loan to the Administrative Agent immediately upon receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such failure to pay by any such Lender together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Borrower to the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at the rate of interest applicable to such Loan.

Taxes
Each payment of any amount payable by any Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction by reason of, any Applicable Taxes. To the extent that any Borrower is obligated by any Requirement of Law to make any deduction or withholding on account of Applicable Taxes from any amount payable to any Lender under this Agreement, such Borrower shall (i) make such deduction or withholding and pay the same to the relevant Governmental Authority and (ii) pay such additional amount to that Lender as is necessary to result in that Lender's receiving a net after-Applicable Tax amount equal to the amount to which that Lender would have been entitled under this Agreement absent such deduction or withholding. If a Lender shall become aware that receipt of such a payment resulted in an excess payment or credit to that Lender on account of such Applicable Taxes, that Lender shall promptly refund such excess to such Borrower. In addition, if any Governmental Authority imposes any Applicable Taxes on any Lender, such Borrower shall indemnify such Lender against such Applicable Taxes; , that such Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any Lender for penalties, interest or other liabilities to the extent arising from such Lender's failure to act in good faith in promptly notifying such Borrower thereof within 45 days from the date on which such Lender became aware of such Applicable Taxes. Payment by any Borrower under this Section shall be made within 30 days from the date any Lender makes written demand for indemnification hereunder, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount being requested from such Borrower. If a Lender shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund (including by way of a credit) from a relevant Governmental Authority directly attributable to Applicable Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of such refund (or credit) and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by such Borrower (whether as a result of notification that it has made to such Borrower or otherwise), make a claim to such Governmental Authority for such refund (or credit) at such Borrower's expense so long as making such a claim is not inconsistent with such Lender's internal policies and is not disadvantageous to such Lender.

Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make IBOR Loans shall be suspended until such Lender shall have notified the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist, that, if the designation of an alternative branch or lending office of the Lender will permit the Lender to make or maintain such IBOR Loans, the Lender will designate such alternative branch or lending office, subject to its determination that such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain IBOR Loans, as the case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until the Requisite Lenders revoke such notice in writing to the Company and the Administrative Agent; , , that no outstanding IBOR Loan shall be terminated prior to the expiration of the Interest Period unless required by law. Upon receipt of such notice, any Borrower may revoke any Request for Extension of Credit then submitted by it.

(c) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Requisite Lenders, or may with the consent of the Requisite Lenders, without notice to (except as expressly provided for in any Loan Document) or demand upon any Credit Party, which are expressly waived by any Credit Party (except as to notices expressly provided for in any Loan Document), proceed to protect, exercise and enforce the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents against any Credit Party and such other rights and remedies as are provided by Requirement of Law or equity.

Section 11.20. .
Tax Forms
(a) Each Lender that is a "foreign corporation, partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company, (a) within 20 days after the Closing Date, or (b) to the extent that it is lawfully able to do so, prior to accepting an assignment in respect of Dollar Loans, two duly signed completed copies of either Form W-8BEN (relating to such Person and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding on all payments to be made to such Person by any Credit Party pursuant to this Agreement) or Form W-8ECI (relating to all payments to be made to such Person by any Credit Party pursuant to this Agreement) of the United States Internal Revenue Service or such other evidence (including, if reasonably
 
necessary, Form W-8 or W-9) satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent that no withholding under the U.S. federal income tax laws is required with respect to such Person. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Person shall (a) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent and the Company two such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Person by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, but only to the extent that it is lawfully able to do so, and (b) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office, if any) to avoid any Requirement of Law that a Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Person or that would eliminate or reduce amounts payable by a Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01. If such Person fails to timely deliver the above forms or other documentation, then the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers may withhold from any interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction. If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers did not properly withhold any tax or other amount from payments made in respect of such Person, such Person shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest and costs and expenses (including reasonable Attorneys Fees of the Administrative Agent). The obligation of the Lenders under this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.
(b) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. For purposes of this Section 11.20(b) FATCA shall include any Treasury regulations or interpretations thereof.
(c) Any Lender that is a "U.S. person" (within the meaning of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
 
thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax.
Section 11.21. .

Judgment
(a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase Dollars with such other currency at Citibank's principal office in London at 11:00 A.M.

EXHIBIT H-1
The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
The Company has all requisite power and corporate authority to enter into and perform the [Credit Agreement], to own its properties and to carry on its business as, to our knowledge, it is now conducted.
The [Credit Agreement] has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company.
Assuming that the [Credit Agreement] is a valid and binding obligation of the Company under the laws of the State of New York, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, under the laws of the State of California, the [Credit Agreement] is a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement (i) to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii) to general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
No governmental consents, approvals authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings are required for the execution and delivery of the [Credit Agreement] on behalf of the Company, or the payment of the Company's obligations under the [Credit Agreement].
Neither the execution and delivery of the [Credit Agreement] on behalf of the Company, nor the payment of the Company's obligations under the [Credit Agreement] (i) violates any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, or (ii) violates any law applicable to the Company.
I do not have knowledge of any action, suit or proceeding against the Company that is either pending or that has been threatened in writing other than those set forth in Attachment A to the opinion letter.
 
EXHIBIT H-2
The Foreign Borrower is a [corporation] duly [incorporated], validly existing and in good standing under the laws of [Country]. The Foreign Borrower is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in the jurisdiction of its formation.
The Foreign Borrower has all requisite power and [corporate] authority to enter into and perform the [Credit Agreement], to own its properties and to carry on its business as, to our knowledge, it is now conducted.
The [Credit Agreement] has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Foreign Borrower and has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Foreign Borrower.
The governing law provisions of the [Credit Agreement] (which provides that the [Credit Agreement] shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York) are valid under the laws of [Country].
Assuming that the [Credit Agreement] is a valid and binding obligation of the Foreign Borrower under the laws of the State of New York, enforceable against the Foreign Borrower in accordance with its terms, under the laws of the State of [Country], the [Credit Agreement] is a valid and binding obligation of the Foreign Borrower, enforceable against the Foreign Borrower in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement (i) to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii) to general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
No governmental consents, approvals authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings are required for the execution and delivery of the [Credit Agreement] on behalf of the Foreign Borrower, or the payment of the Foreign Borrower's obligations under the [Credit Agreement].
Neither the execution and delivery of the [Credit Agreement] on behalf of the Foreign Borrower, nor the payment of the Foreign Borrower's obligations under the [Credit Agreement] (i) violates any provision of the [Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws] of the Foreign Borrower, or (ii) violates any law applicable to the Foreign Borrower.
A judgment (a "US Judgment") obtained by a Lender against the Foreign Borrower in an action taken in any federal or state court of the United States to enforce a payment obligation of the Foreign Borrower under the Credit Agreement or the Notes would be recognized and enforced by a [Country] court in a separate [Country] action
 
EXHIBIT H-2
 
without re-examination of the merits of the US Judgment [insert appropriate assumptions and qualifications].
All taxes, assessments and governmental charges and fees imposed by [Country] or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, the payment of which is required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or recording of the [Credit Agreement], have been paid.
It is not necessary under the laws of [Country] (i) in order to enable the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under the [Credit Agreement] to exercise their respective rights or remedies under the [Credit Agreement] or (ii) by reason only of the execution, delivery or performance of the [Credit Agreement], that any of them be licensed, qualified or entitled to carry on business in [Country]. The [Credit Agreement] is in proper legal form under the laws of [Country] for the enforcement thereof against the Foreign Borrower under the laws of [Country]; and to ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of the [Credit Agreement] in the courts of [Country].
The express submission by the Foreign Borrower to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York State and federal courts sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, would be regarded by a [Country] court as sufficient under [Country] law to grant personal jurisdiction over the Foreign Borrower to such court.
I do not have knowledge of any action, suit or proceeding against the Foreign Borrower that is either pending or that has been threatened in writing other than those set forth in Attachment A to the opinion letter.
