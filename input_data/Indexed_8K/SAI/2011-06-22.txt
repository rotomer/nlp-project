At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of SAIC, Inc. held on June 17, 2011, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to enable stockholders owning at least 10% individually, or 25% collectively, of the voting power of our outstanding shares to require the corporate secretary to call a special meeting of stockholders, subject to the provisions of our bylaws. Following stockholder approval of the amendment to our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors adopted, on June 17, 2011, corresponding changes to our bylaws, including requirements for requesting a special meeting and procedures to provide for an orderly process for calling a special meeting.
As amended, Section 2.02 of the bylaws provides that, for purposes of the ownership requirements, multiple special meeting requests will not be considered together if they relate to different items of business. In addition, in order to be valid, all special meeting requests must have been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated special meeting request. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice and must be a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law. Stockholders submitting a special meeting request are required to provide: (i) identifying information about each requesting stockholder, (ii) a brief description of each matter of business desired to be brought before the special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the special meeting, (iii) the text of the proposal or business, (iv) a description of any material interest of each requesting stockholder in the business to be brought before the special meeting, and (v) any other information that is required to be set forth in a stockholders notice to bring business or a nominee for director before an annual meeting. Section 2.02 also describes how a stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting.
The certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, are attached to this report as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively, and are incorporated by reference.
 
Our Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on June 17, 2011. The final results of the stockholders' vote on each of the matters presented for a vote is set forth below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Board of Directors recommended that stockholders vote to hold future advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers on an annual basis. In light of such recommendation and the strong support for an annual vote as reflected in the above voting results, we will hold future advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers annually.

Annual Meetings.
Section 2.02
Special Meetings.
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board, or by a committee of the Board which has been duly designated by the Board and whose powers and authority, as provided in a resolution of the Board or in the Bylaws, include the power to call such meetings, and shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation following the Secretary's receipt of written requests to call a meeting of stockholders (a "Special Meeting Request") from one stockholder of record owning at least ten percent (10%), or one or more stockholders of record of shares representing in the aggregate at least twenty-five percent (25%), in each case of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of all classes and series of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting, voting as a single class, and who have delivered such requests in accordance with and subject to the provisions of these Bylaws (as amended from time to time), including any limitations set forth in these Bylaws on the ability to make such a request for such a special meeting. Special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons; provided, however, that if and to the extent that any special meeting of stockholders may be called by any other person or persons specified in any provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment thereto or any certificate filed under Section 151(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law") (or its successor statute as in effect from time to time hereafter), then such special meeting may also be called by the person or persons, in the manner, at the times and for the purposes so specified.
(b) In determining whether Special Meeting Requests have met the requirements of this Section 2.02, multiple Special Meeting Requests will not be considered together if they relate to different items of business. Additionally, in order to be valid, all Special Meeting Requests must have been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated Special Meeting Request. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. A Special Meeting Request shall be signed by each stockholder, or duly authorized agent, requesting the special meeting and shall set forth: (i) a brief description of each matter of business desired to be brought before the special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the special meeting, (ii) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment), (iii) any material interest of each stockholder and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the special meeting is being requested in the business desired to be brought before the special meeting, (iv) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of each stockholder requesting the special meeting and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the special meeting is being requested, (v) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned by each stockholder requesting the special meeting and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the

A stockholder may revoke a Special Meeting Request at any time prior to the special meeting; provided however, that if any such revocations are received by the Secretary and, as a result of such revocation, the number of un-revoked Special Meeting Requests no longer represents at least the requisite number of shares entitling the stockholders to request the calling of a special meeting pursuant to Section 2.02(a), then the Board shall have the discretion to determine whether or not to proceed with the special meeting. If none of the stockholders who submitted the Special Meeting Request appear or send a qualified representative (as defined in these Bylaws) to present the proposal(s) or business submitted by the stockholders for consideration at the special meeting, such proposal(s) or business shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation or such stockholder(s).
A Special Meeting Request shall not be valid (and the Board shall have no obligation to call a special meeting in respect of such Special Meeting Request) if it relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law.
The Board shall determine the place, if any, and fix the date and time, of any stockholder requested special meeting. The Board may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at a stockholder requested special meeting.
Section 2.03 All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the State of Delaware, on such date and at such time as may from time to time be designated by the person or persons calling the respective meeting and specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.

Section 2.04
Notice of Meetings and Adjourned Meetings; Waivers of Notice.
(a) Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given to stockholders of the Corporation, as required by applicable law, which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice may be given by such delivery means (mail, telecopy, electronic or other) as the Secretary deems appropriate and in compliance with applicable law and shall be delivered to the stockholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. Unless otherwise required by Delaware Law, such notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. Unless otherwise expressly required by Delaware Law, when a meeting is adjourned to another time or place (whether or not a quorum is present), notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
(b) Any waiver of any such notice given by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
Business at Annual Meeting (other than the Election of Directors).
A stockholder's notice to the Secretary of the Corporation shall set forth: (a) as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and the text of the business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment), and (b) as to the stockholder
 
giving notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is being made, (i) the name and address of such person, (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the Corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation, and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation; (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between or among such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business and any material interest of such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such business, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person; (iv) whether the stockholder giving notice intends, or is part of a group that intends, to solicit proxies from other stockholders in support of such proposal; (v) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting; and (vi) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies by such person with respect to the proposed business to be brought by such person before the annual meeting pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
A stockholder providing notice of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting. Such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation not later than five business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting. Nothing contained in this Section 2.07 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (or any successor provision of law).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.07, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.07, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.07; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.07 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting.
The chair of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section 2.07 and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
Section 2.08 The Secretary of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, as required by applicable law. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
List of Stockholders.
 
Section 2.09 Prior to each meeting of the stockholders, one or more inspectors shall be appointed by the Board, or, if no such appointment shall have been made, such inspectors shall be appointed by the chair of the meeting, to act thereat. Each inspector so appointed shall first subscribe an oath or affirmation faithfully to execute the duties of an inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. Such inspector(s) shall take charge of the ballots at such meeting, count the ballots cast on any question and deliver a written report of the results thereof to the secretary of such meeting. The inspector(s) need not be stockholders of the Corporation. Any officer of the Corporation may be an inspector on any question other than a vote for or against his or her election to any position with the Corporation or on any other question in which he or she may be directly interested other than as a stockholder.
Inspectors.
Section 2.10 The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.

Section 3.03
Election of Directors.
(a) The directors shall be elected annually by the stockholders of the Corporation. A nominee for director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to such nominee's election, except that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in a contested election. An election is contested if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. For election of directors, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a nominee exceeds the votes cast "against" that nominee, without counting abstentions as votes cast. If directors are to be elected by a plurality vote, stockholders may not vote against a nominee.
Voting.
(b) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a meeting of stockholders (1) by or at the direction of the Board, (2) by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (or any other duly authorized committee of the Board), or (3) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of the giving of notice provided for in this Section 3.03(b) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 3.03(b). In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary of the Corporation must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the

Such stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of all stock of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of such shares of stock of the Corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation; and (iv) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice, and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, (i) the name and record address of such person; (ii) (A) the class or series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person and any affiliates or associates of such person, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such person or any affiliates or associates of such person, and the number of shares of stock of the Corporation held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest or other transaction has been entered into by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock of the Corporation) has been made by or on behalf of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, the effect or intent of any of the foregoing being to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, with respect to stock of the Corporation; (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements, or understandings (whether written or oral) between such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, and any proposed nominee or any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are being made by such person, and any material interest of such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person, in such nomination, including any anticipated benefit therefrom to such person, or any affiliates or associates of such person; (iv) a representation that the stockholder giving notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice; (v) a representation whether such stockholder intends, or is part of a group that intends, to solicit proxies from other stockholders in support of such nomination; and (vi) any other information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
 
 
A stockholder providing notice of any nomination proposed to be made at a meeting of stockholders shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 3.03(b) shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting. Such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation not later than five business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of such meeting.
No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 3.03(b) shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 3.03(b) to the contrary, a nomination of persons for election to the Board may be submitted for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to the final rules adopted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") providing for such nominations and inclusion ("final proxy access rules"), and, if such nomination is submitted under the final proxy access rules, such submission (xx) in order to be timely, must be delivered to, or be mailed and received by, the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation no later than 120 calendar days before the date that the Corporation mailed (or otherwise disseminated) its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting (or such other date as may be set forth in the final proxy access rules for companies without advance notice bylaws); (yy) in all other respects, must be made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the final proxy access rules, as in effect at the time of the nomination, or any successor rules or regulations of the SEC then in effect; and (zz) must provide the Corporation with any other information required by this Section 3.03(b) for nominations not made under the final proxy access rules except to the extent that requiring such information to be furnished is prohibited by the final proxy access rules. The provisions of this paragraph of this Section 3.03(b) do not provide stockholders of the Corporation with any rights, nor do they impose upon the Corporation any obligations, other than the rights and obligations set forth in the final proxy access rules.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.03(b), unless otherwise required by applicable law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 3.03(b), to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
