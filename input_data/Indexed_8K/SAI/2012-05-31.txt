MCLEAN, Va., May 31, 2012  SAIC, Inc. (NYSE: SAI), a scientific, engineering, and technology applications company, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, which ended April 30, 2012.
"Our performance for the quarter reflects a combination of pressures we are seeing in the market and internal investments being made to prepare for the future," said John P. Jumper, SAIC president and chief executive officer. "Despite these two factors, I am pleased we delivered positive revenue growth for the quarter, growth that can be attributed to a strategy that leverages our diverse portfolio of government and commercial offerings and the dedicated work of our employees who deliver the highest level of performance to our customers every day."
Summary Operating Results
Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $2.78 billion, up 3 percent from $2.69 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Internal revenue growth represented 2 percent of the consolidated revenue growth.
Operating income for the quarter was $208 million (7.5 percent of revenues), down from $230 million (8.6 percent of revenues) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The reduction in operating income was attributable to increased indirect spending, including bid and proposal costs; an $8 million reduction in net positive changes in contract estimates; and a $6 million gain on the sale of real estate in the prior year quarter.
Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $117 million compared to $130 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. This decline in income from continuing operations was attributable to the reduction in operating income described above, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $0.35, down 3 percent from $0.36 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The diluted share count for the quarter was 330 million, down 5 percent from 348 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Segment Operating Results
 
Defense Solutions
Defense Solutions revenues for the quarter increased 3 percent from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, all of which was internal growth. This growth was attributable to the continued ramp up of a program to operate and maintain the enterprise network IT infrastructure for the U.S. Department of State, increased activity on systems integration and logistics programs for tactical and mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, and the ramp up of a new program with the Defense Logistics Agency to provide supply chain management of military land and aircraft tires. These increases were partially offset by reduced revenue from the U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which was terminated during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Defense Solutions operating income for the quarter was 8.6 percent of revenue, up from 7.9 percent of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 due to reductions in indirect spending.
Health, Energy and Civil Solutions
Health, Energy and Civil Solutions revenues for the quarter increased 3 percent from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, primarily due to the August 2011 acquisition of Vitalize Consulting Solutions, Inc. Internal revenues decreased 3 percent due to declines in various U.S. federal civilian agency programs and program completions with federal health information technology customers, particularly U.S. Department of Defense military health system customers. These declines were partially offset by increased deliveries of non-intrusive cargo inspection systems, increased design-build volume related to geothermal and biomass power plant construction, and strong growth in commercial health technology consulting services.
Health, Energy and Civil Solutions operating income for the quarter was 6.9 percent of revenue, down from 8.2 percent of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. This decline was attributable to higher levels of indirect spending, an increase in amortization expense associated with a prior year acquisition, and unfavorable impacts of changes in contract estimates.
Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions
Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions revenues for the quarter increased 4 percent from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, all of which was internal growth, due to increased activity on airborne surveillance programs and cybersecurity programs. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenues on intelligence analysis programs, primarily due to the drawdown of overseas U.S. military forces and a contract completed in the prior year.
Intelligence and Cybersecurity Solutions operating income for the quarter was 7.1 percent of revenue, down from 9.6 percent of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 due to increased indirect spending, including increased bid and proposal costs and research and development spending; a reduction in net positive changes in contract estimates; and lower sales of propriety software products that have higher relative margins.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other segment operating income for the quarter declined from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 due to a $6 million gain on the sale of real estate in the prior year quarter.
Cash Generation and Capital Deployment
Cash flow used by operations for the quarter was $361 million, due to the payment of the $500 million CityTime settlement. Days sales outstanding were 70 days, improved from 72 days in the prior year quarter.
On April 30, 2012, the Company paid its initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. The Company intends to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future dividends will be determined by the Company's Board of Directors each quarter and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.
As of April 30, 2012, the Company had $1.17 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.85 billion in long-term debt.
New Business Awards
Net business bookings totaled $2.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.8. Notable awards received during the quarter include:
 
 
 
The Company's backlog of signed business orders at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 was $17.4 billion, of which $5.7 billion was funded. As compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, total backlog decreased 4 percent while funded backlog increased 14 percent. Negotiated backlog does not include any estimate of future task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles.
Forward Guidance
Based upon its operating and business development performance through the first quarter of the fiscal year, the Company expects its fiscal year 2013 results to be consistent with the forward guidance provided on March 20, 2012. These expectations are:
 
 
 
Fiscal year 2013 guidance excludes the impact of potential future acquisitions and other non-ordinary course items.

Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. SAIC, Inc. segregates its backlog into two categories: funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog. Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts, and does not include the unfunded portion of contracts where funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized on a quarterly or annual basis by the U.S. Government and other customers, even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. Funded backlog for contracts with non-government agencies represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which SAIC, Inc. is obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Negotiated unfunded backlog represents the estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from (1) negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and (2) unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedule, or other master agreement contract vehicles.
The estimated value of backlog as of the dates presented was as follows:
 
In this release, SAIC, Inc. refers to internal revenue growth (contraction) percentage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The company calculates its internal revenue growth (contraction) percentage by comparing reported revenue for the current year period to the revenue for the prior year period adjusted to include the actual revenue of acquired businesses for the comparable prior year period before acquisition. This calculation has the effect of adding revenue for the acquired businesses for the comparable prior year period to the company's prior year period reported revenue.
SAIC, Inc. uses internal revenue growth (contraction) percentage as an indicator of how successful it is at growing its base business and how successful it is at growing the revenues of the businesses that it acquires. The integration of acquired businesses allows current management to leverage business development capabilities, drive internal resource collaboration, utilize access to markets and qualifications, and refine strategies to realize synergies, which benefits both acquired and existing businesses. As a result, the performance of the combined enterprise post-acquisition is an important measurement. In addition, as a means of rewarding the successful integration and growth of acquired businesses, and not acquisitions themselves, incentive compensation for executives and the broader employee population is based, in part, on achievement of revenue targets linked to internal revenue growth.
The limitation of this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is that internal revenue growth (contraction) percentage is one of two components of the total revenue growth (contraction) percentage, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The company addresses this limitation by presenting the total revenue growth percentage next to or near disclosures of internal revenue growth (contraction) percentage. This financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with SAIC, Inc.'s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The method that the company uses to calculate internal revenue growth (contraction) percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies.
Internal revenue growth (contraction) percentages for the three months ended April 30, 2012 were calculated as follows:
