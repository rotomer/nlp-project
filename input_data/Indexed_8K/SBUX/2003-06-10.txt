EXHIBIT 99.1 [STARBUCKS LOGO] Contact: Audrey Lincoff Starbucks Coffee Company 206-318-5013 alincoff@starbucks.com Peter Maslen Resigns as President, Starbucks Coffee International For Health Reasons ______________________________________________________________________________ SEATTLE; June 10, 2003 - Starbucks Coffee Company (Nasdaq: SBUX) announced today that Peter Maslen has resigned as president, Starbucks Coffee International, Inc. Following a brief medical leave for a heart ailment, Maslen decided that he would focus on improving his health and spending quality time with his family. Orin Smith, president and ceo, Starbucks Coffee Company, will provide strategic direction and leadership to Starbucks Coffee International until Maslen's successor is named. Effective today, Troy Alstead, senior vice president, Finance and Business Development, will serve as the senior leader for Starbucks Coffee International, working closely with Smith during this interim period. Maslen will assist in the transition and serve in an advisory capacity. "For me, it has been a real privilege and a wonderful opportunity to work with the team we have built, and our business partners worldwide," said Maslen. "I am very proud of our achievements, and feel completely confident in the long-term success that we have created together." "Starbucks has benefited greatly from Peter Maslen's leadership," said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman and chief global strategist. "During Peter's tenure, Starbucks international business has grown from 11 countries in 1999 to 30 countries today." "In seven short years, we have grown our international business from one store in Japan to over 1500 stores in 30 countries, and expect it to be profitable in fiscal year 2004," continued Schultz. "From Asia to the Middle East to Europe, the Starbucks Experience has been embraced by millions of customers around the world. As a result of the brand's acceptance, coupled with the substantial investments we have made in roasting plants, systems and infrastructure, we are confident in our long-term target of 15,000 stores internationally. Additionally, we see significant opportunities to create complementary channels of distribution for Starbucks branded products, mirroring our success in North America. We are well on our way to achieving these goals thanks to Peter's contributions."
