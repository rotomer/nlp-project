Item 9. Information Furnished Under Item 12 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition).
     The information contained in this Item 9 of this Current Report is being furnished pursuant to "Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition" of Form 8-K in accordance with SEC Release Nos. 33-8216; 34-47583 (March 27, 2003).
     The information in this Current Report is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
     On July 24, 2003, Starbucks Corporation issued an earnings release announcing its financial results for the 13 and 39 weeks ended June 29, 2003. A copy of the earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
     Exhibit 99.1 to the report contains a "non-GAAP financial measure" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measure covers systemwide retail store sales. This non-GAAP financial measure is discussed below, including the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"), a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and the reasons why the Company believes the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to management and to investors. The non-GAAP financial measure should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
     On page 9 of the earnings release included in Exhibit 99.1, the Company indicated that systemwide retail store sales were $1.2 billion and $972 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, and June 30, 2002, respectively. Systemwide retail store sales were $3.5 billion and $2.8 billion for the 39 weeks ended June 29, 2003, and June 30, 2002, respectively. Management has indicated that the growth of these sales was primarily driven by the opening of 1,133 retail stores in the last 12 months and strong comparable store sales growth for Company-operated retail stores. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to the systemwide retail store sales measure is "Retail" revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings. The systemwide retail store sales measure also includes the net retail revenues generated by licensed stores, as reported by domestic and international licensees or estimated due to timing of periodic reporting by licensees.
     The following table reconciles the Company's total "Retail" revenues, prepared on the basis of GAAP, to total systemwide retail store sales for the periods presented:

     The following table provides a further break down of total systemwide retail store sales between the Company's North American and international operations:
     The systemwide retail store sales measure is useful to management and investors because it provides an indication of consumer spending in Starbucks retail stores, a growing portion of which is licensed and not consolidated into the financial results of Starbucks Corporation. The systemwide retail store sales measure is primarily used by the restaurant industry.

Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today announced revenues and earnings for its fiscal third quarter ended June 29, 2003.
SEATTLE; July 24, 2003 
For the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, consolidated net revenues increased 24 percent to $1.0 billion from $835 million for the same period in fiscal 2002. Net earnings for the 13-week period ended June 29, 2003 increased 23 percent to $68.4 million from $55.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $0.17 for the 13-week period ended June 29, 2003, compared to $0.14 for the comparable period in fiscal 2002.
For the 39 weeks ended June 29, 2003, consolidated net revenues increased 24 percent to $3.0 billion from $2.4 billion for the same period in fiscal 2002. Net earnings for the 39-week period ended June 29, 2003 increased 28 percent to $198.9 million from $155.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $0.50 for the 39-week period ended June 29, 2003, compared to $0.39 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2002.
increased 23.3 percent to $877.8 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of new Company-operated retail stores and an increase in comparable store sales of 8 percent for the period. The increase in comparable store sales was due almost entirely to an increase in customer transactions.
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
Retail revenues
increased 28.9 percent to $159.0 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003. The increase was attributable to growth in the Company's domestic retail licensing channel, foodservice accounts and international licensees.
Specialty revenues
costs were 41.1 percent of net revenues for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003 as compared to 40.4 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher green coffee costs, partially offset by lower food and packaging expenses. The Company's green coffee costs reached a seven-year low in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2002 and have increased gradually since then.
Cost of sales and related occupancy
 
as a percentage of retail revenues increased to 41.2 percent for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from 40.9 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing expenditures, and to a lesser extent, additional expenses incurred to support the Starbucks Card for North American Retail operations. Partially offsetting these increases were lower provisions recorded in the current quarter for asset impairment for international Company-operated retail operations, when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) increased to 26.4 percent of specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, compared to 23.7 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The increase is mainly attributable to continued infrastructure development of the domestic licensing and foodservice channels, including expanding field organizations, restructuring distribution channels and expanding marketing support of new and existing accounts.
Other operating expenses
increased to $59.8 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from $50.9 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002 due to the opening of additional North American and international Company-operated retail stores.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $49.3 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from $47.0 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The increase was attributable to higher payroll-related expenditures. However, as a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 4.8 percent from 5.6 percent.
General and administrative expenses
was $7.9 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, compared to $8.0 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The decrease was mainly attributable to the Company's 40 percent share of the net losses of Starbucks Japan, Ltd., this year compared to a net profit last year, as well as losses sustained by the Switzerland and Austria equity investees, which are in the start-up phase. Partially offsetting these losses were continued strong results experienced by The North American Coffee Partnership, the Company's 50 percent owned ready-to-drink partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, and the Starbucks Ice Cream Partnership with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc., from expanded product lines, lower direct costs and manufacturing efficiencies.
Income from equity investees
increased 21.7 percent to $106.1 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from $87.2 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, mainly due to revenue growth. The operating margin decreased to 10.2 percent of total net revenues in the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, compared to 10.4 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, primarily due to higher green coffee costs.
Operating income
increased to $5.1 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, compared to $1.5 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, primarily due to gains realized on market revaluations of the Company's trading securities, compared to realized losses on this portfolio in the same period last year.
Interest and other income
 
for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003 were based on an effective tax rate of 38.5 percent, compared to 37.2 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, as a result of a shift in the composition of the Company's pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2003.
Income taxes

In addition, Starbucks expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 to be approximately $410 million.

The Company's consolidated financial statements, operating segment results, and other additional information have been provided on the following pages in accordance with current year classifications, and should be reviewed in conjunction with this press release.
 
The following reconciliation of net earnings and earnings per share is provided to assist the reader with understanding the financial impact of one-time items:
 
 
 
Starbucks Corporation is organized into a number of business units that correspond to the Company's operating segments: North American Retail, Business Alliances, which includes North American store licensing and foodservice accounts, and All other business units, which includes international retail, international store licensing, grocery channel licensing, warehouse club accounts, interactive operations, equity investees and other initiatives.
Segment Results
North American Retail revenues increased 21.9 percent, to $803.2 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from $658.9 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, primarily due to the opening of new retail stores and an increase in comparable store sales of 9 percent. The increase in comparable store sales was due almost entirely to higher transaction volume. Operating income increased 14.0 percent to $128.0 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from $112.3 million in the corresponding period in 2002. Operating margin decreased from a record third quarter high of 17.0 percent in the prior year, to 15.9 percent primarily due to higher green coffee costs, higher marketing expenditures and slight increases as a percentage of related revenues in most store operating expenses, except payroll-related expenditures. The Company's green coffee costs reached a seven year low in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2002 and have increased gradually since then.
Business Alliances revenues increased 38.2 percent, to $77.9 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from $56.3 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2002, primarily due to the opening of new licensed stores and the resulting increase in product sales to and royalty revenues from those licensees. Growth in the foodservice channel also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased 1.8 percent to $16.3 million for the 13 weeks ended June 29, 2003, from $16.0 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2002. Operating margin decreased to 20.9 percent of related revenues from 28.4 percent in the prior year due to the change in sales mix to lower margin products and continued investments to restructure distribution channels and expand marketing support of new and existing accounts.
The tables below present net revenues, operating income by operating segment and operating income as a percentage of related revenues, net of intersegment eliminations for the periods indicated:
 
Systemwide retail store sales are used by industry analysts and by management to measure global penetration of Starbucks retail stores. However, this measure excludes revenues generated in non-retail-store channels, such as foodservice accounts, warehouse club accounts, interactive operations, distribution through the Company's grocery channel, or any of the external sales of bottled Frappuccino, Starbucks DoubleShot, or Tazo tea products.
Systemwide Retail Store Sales
Systemwide retail store sales, which include net sales for both Company-operated and licensed retail stores, net store openings per respective period and ending store counts were as follows:
The increases in systemwide retail store sales of 24 and 25 percent for both the 13-week and 39-week periods ended June 29, 2003, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2002 were primarily due to the opening of 1,133 stores in the last 12 months and strong comparable store sales growth for Company-operated retail stores.
