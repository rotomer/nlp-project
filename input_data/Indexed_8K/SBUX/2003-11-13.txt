Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today announced record revenues and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter and its 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003.
SEATTLE; November 13, 2003 
For the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, consolidated net revenues increased 25 percent to $1.1 billion from $865 million for the same period in fiscal 2002. Net earnings for the 13-week period ended September 28, 2003 increased 21 percent to $69.6 million from $57.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $0.17 for the 13-week period ended September 28, 2003, compared to $0.14 for the comparable period in fiscal 2002.
For the 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003, consolidated net revenues increased 24 percent to $4.1 billion from $3.3 billion for the same period in fiscal 2002. Net earnings for the 52-week period ended September 28, 2003 increased 26 percent to $268.3 million from $212.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $0.67 for the 52-week period ended September 28, 2003, compared to $0.54 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2002.
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 24.3 percent to $913.1 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 602 new Company-operated retail stores, the acquisition of Seattle's Best Coffee and Torrefazzione Italia stores in July, and an increase in comparable store sales of 9 percent for the period. The increase in comparable store sales was due almost entirely to an increase in customer transactions.
Retail revenues
increased 28.5 percent to $167.9 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in domestic retail licensing, the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company, and growth in the foodservice channel. The product innovations and promotions, which have driven sales in the Company-operated retail channels, have also contributed to the non-retail channels.
Specialty revenues
costs were 41.5 percent of net revenues for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, compared to 41.1 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to a shift in the non-retail revenue mix to lower margin products and higher green coffee costs. These increases were partially offset by leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base.
Cost of sales and related occupancy
 
as a percentage of retail revenues increased to 40.9 percent for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from 40.6 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to payroll-related expenditures and was partially offset by lower provisions for asset impairment for international Company-operated retail stores.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 26.0 percent of specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, compared to 26.1 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, primarily due to the additional revenue streams generated by Seattle Coffee Company, partially offset by higher payroll-related expenditures for non-retail channels.
Other operating expenses
increased to $62.7 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $54.4 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002 primarily due to the opening of additional North American and international Company-operated retail stores. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.8 percent from 6.3 percent.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $57.1 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $46.7 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures. However, as a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent.
General and administrative expenses
was $17.4 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, compared to $12.5 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to continued strong results by the North American Coffee Partnership, the Company's 50 percent owned ready-to-drink partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, from expanded product lines, lower direct costs, and manufacturing efficiencies. Also contributing to the increase was the addition of two profitable equity investees, as Starbucks increased its proportionate ownership in the Taiwan and Shanghai markets to 50 percent during the fourth quarter.
Income from equity investees
increased 26.5 percent to $112.4 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $88.8 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, mainly due to revenue growth. The operating margin increased to 10.4 percent of total net revenues in the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, compared to 10.2 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, primarily due to strong revenue growth during the quarter, partially offset by a shift in the revenue mix to lower margin products and higher green coffee costs.
Operating income
 
decreased to $0.8 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $3.2 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses related to a higher volume of Euro-based transactions and the relative decline in value of the United States dollar, compared to foreign currency exchange gains in the prior period.
Interest and other income
for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003 were based on an effective tax rate of 38.5 percent, compared to 37.3 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, as a result of a shift in the composition of the Company's pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2003. Operations based in the United States were more profitable than the prior year, and international operations, which are in various phases of development, generated greater non-deductible losses than anticipated.
Income taxes
Fiscal 2004 Targets
The Company reiterated the following fiscal 2004 targets:
In addition, Starbucks expects the effective tax rate to be 38.0 percent for fiscal 2004. The Company is planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of $450 to $475 million.

Segment Results
Starbucks Corporation is organized into a number of business units that correspond to the Company's two operating segments: North American Retail and Business Alliances, which includes North American store licensing and foodservice accounts. All other business units include international retail, international store licensing, grocery channel licensing, warehouse club accounts, interactive operations, equity investees and other initiatives.
The tables below present net revenues, operating income by operating segment and operating income as a percentage of related revenues, net of intersegment eliminations for the periods indicated:
(unaudited, in thousands)
    Included in all other business units are revenues for the Company's international retail business unit of $80,782 and $60,198 for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, respectively, and $290,399 and $209,148 for the 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, respectively. Revenues for both North American Retail and international retail are reflected in "Retail" revenues, and all other revenues are included in "Specialty" revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
(a)
    Unallocated corporate includes general and administrative expenses and certain depreciation expenses on general and administrative related assets.
(b)
North American Retail revenues increased 23.4 percent, to $832.3 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $674.3 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2002, primarily due to the opening of new retail stores, an increase in comparable store sales of 9 percent and the July 2003 acquisition of 49 Seattle's Best Coffee LLC and 21 Torrefazione Italia LLC stores. The increase in comparable store sales was due almost entirely to higher transaction volume, driven by product innovation and speed of service initiatives. Operating income increased 17.0 percent to $128.0 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $109.4 million in the corresponding period in 2002. Operating margin decreased from 16.2 percent in the prior year to 15.4 percent, primarily due to a continuing trend of increasing green coffee costs as well as higher payroll-related expenditures.
 
Business Alliances revenues increased 39.0 percent, to $81.6 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $58.7 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2002, primarily due to the opening of 323 new licensed stores predominantly in supermarkets, and the resulting increase in product sales to and royalty revenues from those licensees. Growth in the foodservice channel also contributed to the increase primarily due to the addition of new accounts and additional sales of non-coffee items, such as packaged food and tea products. Operating income increased 6.1 percent to $15.4 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $14.5 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2002. Operating margin decreased to 18.9 percent of related revenues from 24.7 percent in the prior year due to continued investments to restructure distribution channels and the change in sales mix to lower margin products.
Revenues for all other business units increased 26.5 percent, to $167.1 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $132.1 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2002. The increase was mainly due to 34.2 percent revenue growth for international retail operations, attributable to 67 new Company-operated retail stores and 9 percent comparable store sales growth, as well as the addition of Seattle Coffee Company non-retail channels. Operating income increased by 95.8 percent to $34.5 million for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2003, from $17.6 million in the corresponding period in 2002, primarily due to improved performance in international retail, the North American Coffee Partnership, international licensing and the addition of Seattle Coffee Company non-retail operations. Operating margin increased to 20.7 percent from 13.3 percent in the prior year.
Starbucks is currently evaluating a reorganization of its operating segments into two geographically distinct operations: United States and International. Starbucks plans to finalize these changes and prepare comparable segment data for prior periods in its annual report on Form 10-K.
Investment Accounting Change
During fiscal 2003, Starbucks increased its equity ownership to 50 percent for several of its international licensed operations, which enabled the Company to exert significant influence over their operating and financial policies. For these operations, consisting of Shanghai, Spain, and Taiwan, management determined that a change in accounting method, from the cost method to the equity method, was required. This accounting change included adjusting information reported prior to the 13-week period ended September 28, 2003, for the Company's proportionate share of net losses as required by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock."
As shown in the table below, the cumulative effect of the accounting change to the equity method resulted in a $0.1 million reduction of previously reported net earnings for the first three fiscal quarters of 2003. The restatements below include the accounting changes for Shanghai, Spain and Taiwan. These amounts are subsequent to the accounting changes for Switzerland and Austria, which were included in the Company's fiscal second quarter earnings release
:
 
Similarly, reductions of net earnings of $0.1 million for both the 52 weeks ended September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, have also been recorded. For fiscal years prior to 2001, the total impact of the accounting changes was a reduction of net earnings of $0.2 million. The following table summarizes the effects of the investment accounting change on net earnings and earnings per share for the periods indicated.
Acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company
On July 14, 2003, Starbucks completed its acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company from AFC Enterprises, Inc., in an-all cash transaction of approximately $73 million. Seattle Coffee Company includes the Seattle's Best Coffee ("SBC") and Torrefazione Italia Coffee ("TI") brands, which complements the Company's existing portfolio of products. Included in stores open as of September 28, 2003, are 43 SBC and 21 TI Company-operated stores and 74 SBC franchised stores.
