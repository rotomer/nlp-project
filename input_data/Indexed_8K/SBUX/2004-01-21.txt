Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today announced record revenues and earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended December 28, 2003.
SEATTLE; January 21, 2004 
For the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, consolidated net revenues increased 27.7 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.0 billion for the same period in fiscal 2003. Net earnings for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, increased 41.4 percent to $110.8 million from $78.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings were $0.27 per share for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $0.20 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.
"I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results. Our partners' focused execution at all levels of the business resulted in the most successful first quarter in Starbucks history," stated Orin Smith, president and ceo. "From a strong holiday promotion in our retail stores, to continued growth of our specialty and international operations, our performance sets a strong foundation for Starbucks fiscal year 2004."
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 27.2 percent to $1.1 billion for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, from $849.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 670 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 10 percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due almost entirely to an increase in the number of customer transactions.
Company-operated retail revenues
increased 30.3 percent to $200.7 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $154.0 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 34.9 percent growth in licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, grocery and warehouse club licensing, and certain other branded-product operations. The Company added 704 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Additionally, the Company's foodservice business contributed to the growth as a result of the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2003 and the addition of new Starbucks foodservice accounts.
Specialty revenues
 
were 41.4 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to 41.8 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to efficiencies gained in the Company's international supply chain operations and leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by a shift in sales mix toward lower margin products.
Cost of sales and related occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 37.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, from 37.7 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on fixed expenditures spread over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by higher holiday marketing expenditures.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) increased to 22.0 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to 20.5 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily attributable to expanding the foodservice distribution network and maintaining new and existing customer accounts.
Other operating expenses
increased to $65.9 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $57.4 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 670 Company-operated retail stores and the refurbishment of existing Company-operated retail stores. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.1 percent for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, from 5.7 percent for the same period in fiscal 2003.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $69.6 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $60.9 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures. However, as a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.4 percent for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, from 6.1 percent for the same period in fiscal 2003.
General and administrative expenses
increased $3.8 million to $10.4 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, from $6.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to new licensed retail store openings, improved operating results in several international markets, and the July 2003 increase in the Company's ownership interest from 5 percent to 50 percent for the Taiwan and Shanghai licensed operations.
Income from equity investees
 
increased 45.3 percent to $175.5 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $120.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 13.7 percent of total net revenues in the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to 12.0 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to the leverage gained in most operating expense line items from strong revenue growth.
Operating income
decreased to $3.2 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, from $4.5 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 related to the Company's application of the spot-to-spot method for net investment hedges, and a small loss this year compared to a small gain last year related to transactions based in currencies other than the United States dollar.
Interest and other income
Fiscal 2004 Targets
The Company also provided updated fiscal 2004 targets:
 
In addition, Starbucks is continuing to target an effective tax rate of 38.0 percent for fiscal 2004. The Company continues to plan for capital expenditures to be in the range of $450 to $475 million. Based on the strength of the Company's core business as reflected in its first quarter results, Starbucks believes it is well-positioned to aggressively pursue its goals of approximately 20 percent revenue growth and 20 to 25 percent earnings per share growth over the next three to five years.

Segment Results
Segment information is prepared consistent with the basis on which the Company's management internally reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes, which correlates to two distinct operating segments: United States and International.
United States
United States operations ("United States") sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company-operated retail stores. Specialty operations within the United States include: retail store and other licensing operations, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Company's core businesses.
International
International operations ("International") sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company-operated retail stores in Canada, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Australia, as well as through retail store licensing operations and foodservice accounts in these and 27 other countries. Because International operations are in an early phase of development and have country-specific regulatory requirements, they require a more extensive administrative support organization, compared to the United States, to provide resources and respond to business needs.
Unallocated Corporate
Unallocated corporate expenses pertain to certain functions, such as executive management, administration, tax, treasury, and information technology infrastructure, and include related depreciation and amortization expenses.
Historical annual and quarterly financial data for the United States and International operating segments as well as the statements of earnings reclassifications for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 will be posted on the Investor Relations page at http://www.starbucks.com by February 2004.
The tables below present, by operating segment, total net revenues, operating income and operating income as a percentage of related revenues, net of intersegment eliminations for the periods indicated:

United States
United States total net revenues increased by $231.2 million, or 26.9 percent, to $1.1 billion for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $859.4 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased by $189.1 million, or 25.7 percent, to $924.5 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $735.4 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to the opening of 563 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 11 percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was almost entirely due to an increase in the number of customer transactions. Total United States specialty revenues increased $42.1 million, or 33.9 percent, to $166.1 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $124.0 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to growth in the foodservice and grocery businesses as a result of the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2003, as well as the opening of 428 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.
 
United States operating income increased by 27.4 percent to $216.7 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003 from $170.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 19.9 percent of related revenues from 19.8 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on fixed operating costs spread over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by higher expenditures to support the Company's expansion of its specialty operations and higher dairy costs.
International
International total net revenues increased by $46.5 million, or 32.3 percent, to $190.6 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $144.1 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003.

Total international specialty revenues increased $4.6 million, or 15.2 percent, to $34.6 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, compared to $30.1 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 276 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, partially offset by proportionate eliminations of sales to equity investees, in which the Company increased its ownership interests in late fiscal 2003.
International operating income increased to $11.0 million for the 13 weeks ended December 28, 2003, from ($1.4) million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 5.8 percent of related revenues from (1.0) percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on fixed costs spread over an expanded revenue base, increased earnings generated by equity investees and efficiencies gained in the Company's international supply chain operations.
