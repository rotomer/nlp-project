Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today announced revenues and earnings for its fiscal second quarter ended March 28, 2004.
SEATTLE; April 21, 2004 
For the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, consolidated net revenues increased 30 percent to $1.2 billion from $954 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Net earnings for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, increased 53 percent to $79 million from $52 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings were $0.19 per share for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to $0.13 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.
For the 26 weeks ended March 28, 2004, consolidated net revenues increased 29 percent to $2.5 billion from $2.0 billion for the same period in fiscal 2003. Net earnings for the 26 weeks ended March 28, 2004, increased 46 percent to $190 million from $130 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings were $0.46 per share for the 26 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to $0.33 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.
"During the second quarter, all areas of our business, from our retail operations both domestically and internationally, to our specialty businesses delivered strong financial performance," stated Orin Smith, president and ceo. "Company-operated retail stores posted the strongest quarterly comparable store sales gain for the Company in more than ten years. Additionally, innovation was prevalent throughout the Company and we believe recently announced initiatives combined with our core retail business provide a powerful platform for future growth."
increased 30 percent to $1.1 billion for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, from $809 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 671 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 12 percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to an 11 percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a one percent increase in the average dollar value per transaction.
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
Company-operated retail revenues
 
increased 32 percent to $191 million for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to $145 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Licensing revenues increased 33 percent to $123 million due to the addition of 705 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months as well as growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses. Foodservice and other revenues increased 29 percent to $68 million primarily due to the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2003 and growth in new and existing Starbucks foodservice accounts.
Specialty revenues
were unchanged at 41.1 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. A shift in sales mix toward lower margin products and higher green coffee and dairy commodity costs were offset by efficiencies in supply chain distribution operations and leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs spread over an expanded revenue base.
Cost of sales and related occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, from 40.7 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003 primarily due to leverage gained on fixed occupancy and personnel expenditures spread over an expanded revenue base. This leverage was partially offset by costs associated with retail management participation in the Company's global leadership conference held in March 2004. The conference is an important investment in the Company's development of its partners (employees).
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 21.4 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to 25.2 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to leverage in the current fiscal period on most fixed expenditures spread over an expanded revenue base and a $2.0 million provision recorded in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003 for dissolving the Company's licensed Israel operations.
Other operating expenses
increased to $72.0 million for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to $58.0 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 671 Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with the Company's foodservice operations. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.8 percent for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, from 6.1 percent for the same period in fiscal 2003.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
 
increased to $80.0 million for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to $59.6 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.4 percent for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, from 6.2 percent for the same period in fiscal 2003. As a percentage of total net revenues, the increase was due to a higher provision for incentive compensation based on the Company's outstanding performance during the quarter.
General and administrative expenses
increased $5.7 million to $12.3 million for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, from $6.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The increase was attributable to volume driven operating results in international markets, particularly in Japan, as well as the North American Coffee Partnership. New licensed retail store openings and the July 2003 increase in the Company's ownership interest from five percent to 50 percent for the Taiwan and Shanghai licensed operations also contributed to the growth.
Income from equity investees
increased 45.6 percent to $124.5 million for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to $85.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 10.0 percent of total net revenues in the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, compared to 9.0 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to reductions in store operating, other operating, and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.
Operating income
increased to $3.7 million for the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2004, from $1.2 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash and liquid investment balances and a smaller loss this year compared to last year related to transactions based in currencies other than the United States dollar.
Interest and other income
The Company also provided updated fiscal 2004 targets:
