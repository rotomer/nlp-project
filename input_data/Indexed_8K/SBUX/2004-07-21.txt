Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today announced record revenues and earnings for its fiscal third quarter ended June 27, 2004.
SEATTLE; July 21, 2004 
For the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, consolidated net revenues increased 27 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.0 billion for the same period in fiscal 2003. Net earnings for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, increased 44 percent to $98 million from $68 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $0.24 for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to $0.17 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.
For the 39 weeks ended June 27, 2004, consolidated net revenues increased 28 percent to $3.8 billion from $3.0 billion for the same period in fiscal 2003. Net earnings for the 39 weeks ended June 27, 2004, increased 45 percent to $288 million from $199 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $0.70 for the 39 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to $0.50 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.
"Our third quarter financial results demonstrate the on-going strength of our business," commented Orin Smith, president and ceo. "Starbucks operations are functioning at a more sophisticated level than ever before. Our consistently strong performance positions us well to achieve our aggressive fiscal 2005 goals  including an acceleration of store growth as we pursue the Company's expanding global opportunity."
increased 26 percent to $1.1 billion for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, from $878 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 651 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 11 percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 10 percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a one percent increase in the average dollar value per transaction.
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
Company-operated retail revenues
 
increased 32 percent to $211 million for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to $159 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Licensing revenues increased 33 percent to $139 million due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 727 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2003, and growth in the grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 31 percent to $71 million primarily due to the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company and growth in new and existing Starbucks foodservice accounts.
Specialty revenues
were unchanged at 41.1 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs were offset by efficiencies in supply chain distribution operations and leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base.
Cost of sales and related occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.4 percent for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, from 40.9 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher costs in the prior year associated with regional leadership conferences and provisions for asset impairment for international Company-operated retail stores. In the fiscal second quarter of 2004, the Company held its first global leadership conference for retail management partners (employees), which replaced regional conferences held during the fiscal third quarter of 2003. The conferences are important investments in the development of the Company's retail management partners (employees).
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 21.0 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to 22.5 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payroll-related expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by provisions for asset impairment related to integrating Seattle Coffee Company grocery operations into Starbucks distribution channels.
Other operating expenses
increased to $70.6 million for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to $59.8 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 651 Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with the Company's foodservice operations. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 5.4 percent for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, from 5.8 percent for the same period in fiscal 2003.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
 
increased to $73.4 million for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to $58.1 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to additional staff to support the accelerated retail store growth. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses were unchanged at 5.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, and June 29, 2003.
General and administrative expenses
increased $5.6 million to $13.5 million for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, from $7.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume driven operating results for the North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks Double Shot coffee drinks, and new licensed retail store openings, particularly in Japan. The July 2003 increase from five percent to 50 percent in the Company's ownership interest in the Taiwan and Shanghai licensed operations also contributed to the growth.
Income from equity investees
increased 45.1 percent to $153.8 million for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to $106.0 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 11.7 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, compared to 10.2 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to reductions in store operating and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.
Operating income
decreased to $4.4 million for the 13 weeks ended June 27, 2004, from $5.1 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to lower gains realized on market revaluations of the Company's trading securities.
