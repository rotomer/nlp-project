EXHIBIT 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX) today announced revenues and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 3, 2004, which included 14 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively. The fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 28, 2003, included 13 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively.
SEATTLE; November 10, 2004 
For the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, consolidated net revenues increased 34 percent to $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased 25 percent when calculated on a comparative 13-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Net earnings for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, increased 49 percent to $103 million from $70 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $0.25 for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $0.17 per share for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2003.
For the 53-week fiscal year ended October 3, 2004, consolidated net revenues increased 30 percent to $5.3 billion from $4.1 billion for fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased 27 percent when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Net earnings for fiscal 2004 increased 46 percent to $392 million from $268 million for fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $0.95 for fiscal 2004, compared to $0.67 per share for fiscal 2003. For the 14 weeks and 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, diluted earnings per share included an estimated $0.03 per share benefit from the extra week in fiscal September 2004.
"Fiscal 2004 has been an amazing year of outstanding performance throughout our business," stated Howard Schultz, chairman. "Our aggressive global store expansion, innovation ranging from food and beverage to music and execution of new and expanded agreements for licensing, grocery and foodservice all contributed to our results. We look forward to building on this momentum in fiscal 2005."
"We achieved remarkable financial results during fiscal 2004," stated Orin Smith, president and ceo. "In addition to posting the first year of double digit comparable store sales increase in more than a decade  a particularly notable accomplishment when considering the size of our Company-operated business, we also reported earnings per share of $0.95 for fiscal 2004, a full $0.10 above the high end of our original target announced in July of 2003."
 
"We are very excited about the upcoming holiday season and believe our comprehensive promotion will enable us to continue our strong momentum," stated Jim Donald, ceo designate. "Our stores, together with our exciting food and beverage line-up, will provide a respite for our customers during this busy season. Additionally, our promotion includes a great variety of relevant gifting options for holiday shoppers."
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 33 percent to $1.2 billion for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from $913 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, Company-operated retail revenues increased 24 percent to $1.1 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 634 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of nine percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to an increase of eight percent in the number of customer transactions and a one percent increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales percentages were calculated excluding the sixth week of fiscal September 2004.
Company-operated retail revenues
increased 40 percent to $235 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $168 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Licensing revenues increased 45 percent to $165 million due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 710 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 30 percent to $70 million primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, total specialty revenues increased 30 percent to $218 million.
Specialty revenues
increased to 42.4 percent of total net revenues for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to 41.5 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs. The Company gained leverage from occupancy costs, which are largely fixed expenses, due to the extra sales week in fiscal September 2004.
Cost of sales and related occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 41.9 percent for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 40.6 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures and costs for maintaining retail stores and equipment due to sustained high traffic levels.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 18.3 percent of total specialty revenues for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to 22.4 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payroll-related expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base.
Other operating expenses
 
increased to $71.6 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $62.7 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 634 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with shortened estimated useful lives of equipment deployed in the Company's foodservice operations. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 4.9 percent for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 5.8 percent for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to the leverage of fixed depreciation expenses from the extra sales week in 2004.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $80.5 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $65.9 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to additional employees to support planned acceleration of retail store growth. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.5 percent for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.1 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003.
General and administrative expenses
increased $7.1 million to $24.5 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from $17.4 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume driven operating results for the North America Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot coffee drinks, and improved profitability of Starbucks Japan.
Income from equity investees
increased 39 percent to $156.3 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $112.4 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 10.7 percent of total net revenues for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to 10.4 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained from the additional sales week in the fourth quarter this year compared to last year.
Operating income
increased to $2.8 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from $0.8 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash and liquid investment balances.
Interest and other income
for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.0 percent, compared to 38.5 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, and a full year 2004 effective tax rate of 37.2 percent. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to improved operating results as fewer non-deductible losses were generated from international markets, which are in various phases of development.

Segment Results
Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Company's management internally reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.
United States
United States operations ("United States") sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company-operated retail stores.

The tables below present, by operating segment, total net revenues, operating income and operating income as a percentage of related revenues, net of intersegment eliminations for the periods ended
(in thousands):
 
United States
United States total net revenues increased by $306 million, or 33 percent, to $1.2 billion for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $918 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, United States total net revenues increased 24 percent to $1.1 billion. Company-operated retail revenues increased $251 million, or 32 percent, to $1.0 billion for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $779 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to the opening of 514 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of nine percent. The increase in comparable store sales was due to an eight percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a one percent increase in the average dollar value per transaction. Comparable store sales percentages were calculated excluding the sixth week of fiscal September 2004.
Total United States specialty revenues increased $56 million, or 40 percent, to $194 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $139 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Licensing revenues increased $42 million, or 48 percent, to $129 million from $87 million in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to volume driven growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business as a result of expanded agreements with Kraft including the addition of six new Starbucks coffees, along with a selection of Tazo teas. In addition, product sales and royalty revenues increased as a result of opening 417 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased $14 million, or 26 percent, to $65 million from $51 million in fiscal 2003, due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.
United States operating income increased 23 percent to $188 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from $152 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Operating margin decreased to 15.4 percent of related revenues from 16.6 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. This was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures to support the Company's planned acceleration of retail store growth, as well as higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, partially offset by leverage gained on fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base.
International
International total net revenues increased by $66 million, or 40 percent, to $229 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $163 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, international total net revenues increased 31 percent to $213 million. Company-operated retail revenues increased by $54 million, or 41 percent, to $188 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $134 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 120 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, the weakening of the United States dollar against both the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar and comparable store sales growth of five percent. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a four
 
percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a one percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Total international specialty revenues increased $11 million, or 39 percent, to $41 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $29 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003.

International operating income increased to $20 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, compared to $12 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 8.8 percent of related revenues from 7.1 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. Excluding Canadian operations, operating income increased to $10 million for the 14 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from $5 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2003.
