     Under the Agreement, Mr. Smith will continue to serve as president and chief executive officer of the Company through March 31, 2005.

Depending upon the Company's performance and in accordance with the terms of the EMB Plan, Mr. Smith will be eligible for a pro rated bonus for the Company's fiscal year ending October 2, 2005 ("Fiscal 2005") based on the approximately six months during Fiscal 2005 during which Mr. Smith will have served as the Company's president and chief executive officer.
