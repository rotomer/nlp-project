Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 26 percent to $1.4 billion for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, from $1.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 642 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 10 percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a six percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a four percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Company-operated retail revenues
increased 15 percent to $231 million for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, compared to $201 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. Licensing revenues increased 18 percent to $157 million primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 740 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 10 percent to $74 million primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts.
Specialty revenues
 
decreased to 40.9 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, compared to 41.4 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to a higher average value per retail transaction, partially offset by higher initial costs associated with the Company's recent expansion of the food program in Company-operated retail stores.
Cost of sales and related occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 38.3 percent for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, from 37.6 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher marketing and payroll-related expenditures for planned acceleration of Company-operated retail store growth and to ensure a consistent in existing stores, partially offset by strong revenue growth.

Starbucks Experience
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 19.2 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, compared to 21.8 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to efficiencies gained from fully integrating the Seattle Coffee Company during fiscal 2004 and lower expenditures related to marketing and distribution within the grocery and warehouse club businesses.
Other operating expenses
increased to $76 million for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, compared to $66 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004.

Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $84 million for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, compared to $70 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures and professional fees in support of both domestic and international expansion. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.3 percent for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, from 5.5 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004.
General and administrative expenses
increased $3 million to $13 million for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, from $10 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot coffee drinks, and improved results from international investees as a result of new licensed retail store openings.
Income from equity investees
 
increased 30 percent to $227 million for the 13 weeks ended January 2, 2005, compared to $175 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2004.

Stock Compensation Expense
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("FAS 123R"), a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." FAS 123R will require Starbucks to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using the fair value method and record compensation expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Starbucks is evaluating the impact of FAS 123R and will implement this new rule no later than the Company's fiscal fourth quarter of 2005. In the interim, the Company will continue to regularly disclose the pro forma impact of stock compensation on the Company's net earnings and earnings per share within its periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with current accounting rules.
