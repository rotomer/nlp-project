Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 22 percent to $1.3 billion for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, from $1.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 669 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of seven percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a four percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a three percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Company-operated retail revenues
 
increased 23 percent to $235 million for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to $191 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. Licensing revenues increased 32 percent to $161 million primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 758 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased eight percent to $73 million primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts.
Specialty revenues
increased to 41.4 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to 41.0 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to higher initial costs associated with the Company's continued expansion of the lunch program in Company-operated retail stores, as well as higher dairy costs, offset in part by a higher average value per retail transaction.
Cost of sales and related occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 41.5 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, from 40.6 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures for future planned acceleration in Company-operated store openings, extended store operating hours and a higher number of drive-thru locations opened in the past year, as well as higher maintenance and repair expenditures to ensure a consistent in existing stores.
Store operating expenses
Starbucks Experience
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 19.7 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to 21.4 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures within the grocery and warehouse club businesses and efficiencies gained from the expansion of the foodservice distribution network.
Other operating expenses
increased to $88 million for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to $74 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 669 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 5.8 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, from 6.0 percent for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2004.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $82 million for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to $80 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees in support of both domestic and international expansion, partially offset by a lower provision for incentive compensation. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.4 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, from 6.4 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004.
General and administrative expenses
 
increased to $16 million for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to $12 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot coffee drinks, and improved results from international investees as a result of new licensed retail store openings, particularly in Japan.
Income from equity investees
increased 27 percent to $157 million for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to $124 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2004. Operating margin increased to 10.3 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to 10.0 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to strong revenue growth and leverage of general and administrative and other operating expenses, partially offset by higher retail store operating expenses.
Operating income
remained unchanged at $4 million for both the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, and March 28, 2004. Higher interest income earned on higher cash and liquid investment balances was offset by a decrease in the market value of trading securities for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, compared to an increase in market value in the corresponding period in fiscal 2004.
Interest and other income
for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, increased 27 percent to $101 million from $79 million for the same period in fiscal 2004. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2005, increased 26 percent to $0.24, compared to $0.19 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2004.

Stock Compensation Expense
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS 123R will require Starbucks to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using the fair value method and record compensation expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Starbucks is continuing to evaluate the impact of SFAS 123R and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") interpretive guidance released in late March 2005. In the interim, the Company will continue to regularly disclose the pro forma impact of stock compensation on the Company's net earnings and earnings per share within its periodic filings with the SEC in accordance with current accounting rules.
