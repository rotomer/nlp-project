Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced revenues and earnings for its fiscal third quarter ended July 3, 2005.
SEATTLE; July 27, 2005 
For the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, consolidated net revenues increased 21 percent to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion for the same period in fiscal 2004. Net earnings for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, increased 29 percent to $126 million from $98 million for the same period in fiscal 2004. Earnings were $0.31 per share for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to $0.24 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2004.
"We are very pleased with the strength of both U.S. and International operations  reflected in our solid third-quarter revenue results and the expansion of our operating margin during the quarter," commented Jim Donald, Starbucks president and ceo. "We remain committed to building shareholder value by executing our strategy and realizing the tremendous growth opportunities available to Starbucks on a global basis. Our strong performance year-to-date positions us well to achieve our fiscal 2005 goals  and gives us confidence in the aggressive store growth targets we have established for fiscal 2006."
increased 22 percent to $1.4 billion for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, from $1.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 713 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of seven percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a four percent increase in the average value per transaction and a three percent increase in the number of customer transactions.
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
Company-operated retail revenues
 
increased 16 percent to $245 million for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to $211 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. Licensing revenues increased 17 percent to $170 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 839 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 14 percent to $75 million, primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts.
Specialty revenues
decreased to 40.6 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to 41.0 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The decrease is primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, offset in part by higher average rent expense in International markets. Dairy costs were moderately lower for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to the same period in fiscal 2004.
Cost of sales and related occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.2 percent for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to 40.4 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, partially offset by higher payroll expenditures. In order to facilitate ongoing, accelerated retail store growth, the Company has been increasing the number of assistant store managers and opening a higher number of drive-thru locations over the past year, which has contributed to the higher payroll expenditures.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 19.8 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to 21.0 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures within the grocery and warehouse club channels, partially offset by higher costs associated with expanding emerging specialty businesses, such as music and consumer products.
Other operating expenses
increased to $85 million for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to $73 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 713 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 5.3 percent for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, from 5.5 percent for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2004.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $91 million for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to $73 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation and increased charitable commitments. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 5.7 percent for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, from 5.6 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004.
General and administrative expenses
 
increased to $18 million for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to $13 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for the North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot espresso drink, and improved operating results from international investees, particularly in Korea and Japan.
Income from equity investees
increased 30 percent to $200 million for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to $153 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2004. As a result of lower store and other operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues, operating margin increased to 12.5 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to 11.6 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2004.
Operating income
for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, increased 29 percent to $126 million from $98 million for the same period in fiscal 2004. Earnings were $0.31 per share for the 13 weeks ended July 3, 2005, compared to $0.24 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2004.

Stock Compensation Expense
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS 123R will require Starbucks to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using the fair value method and record compensation expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Starbucks is continuing to evaluate the impact of SFAS 123R and all related interpretive guidance. In the interim, the Company will continue to regularly disclose the pro forma impact of stock compensation on the Company's net earnings and earnings per share within its periodic filings with the SEC in accordance with current accounting rules. The pro forma impacts for the 13 and 39 weeks ended July 3, 2005, and June 27, 2004, were as follows for the information presented ():
