Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced revenues and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 2, 2005, which included 13 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 3, 2004, included 14 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively. All applicable references to earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the recent two-for-one stock split completed on October 21, 2005.
SEATTLE; November 17, 2005 
For the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, consolidated net revenues increased to a record $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004. Net revenues increased 23 percent when calculated on a comparative 13-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Net earnings for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, increased 21 percent to $124 million from $103 million for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.16 for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $0.12 per share for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004.
For the 52-week fiscal year ended October 2, 2005, consolidated net revenues rose to a record $6.4 billion from $5.3 billion for fiscal 2004. Net revenues increased 23 percent when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Net earnings for fiscal 2005 increased 27 percent to $494 million from $389 million for fiscal 2004. Earnings per share were $0.61 for fiscal 2005, compared to $0.47 per share for fiscal 2004.
"Starbucks record results in fiscal 2005 reflect the exciting momentum that we continue to see throughout our business, and demonstrate the underlying power of the Starbucks brand," commented Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman. "We are particularly encouraged by the early success and the continuously expanding development potential of our International business. From opening a record number of new stores, to the ongoing popularity of our core beverage and food items, to enhancing the customer experience through unique offerings in music and consumer products, Starbucks is appealing to a broad and diverse global consumer base."
Schultz continued, "During the year, Jim Donald successfully transitioned into his new role as president and ceo. His contributions and leadership are evident in our record results this year."
 
"This year, we again leveraged cross-market learnings into innovative and successful new products that, combined with our popular core offerings, stirred enthusiastic response from our customers," Jim Donald added. "Starbucks terrific financial performance, while pursuing aggressive growth, shows our ability to translate our efforts into long-term shareholder value."
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 14 percent to $1.4 billion for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from $1.2 billion for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, Company-operated retail revenues increased 23 percent. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 735 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of eight percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a four percent increase in the average value per transaction and a four percent increase in the number of customer transactions. Comparable store sales were calculated excluding the 14th week of fiscal fourth quarter 2004.
Company-operated retail revenues
increased 13 percent to $267 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $235 million for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, specialty revenues increased 22 percent. Licensing revenues increased 12 percent to $184 million in fiscal 2005 and increased 20 percent on a comparable 13-week basis over fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 937 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 17 percent to $82 million in fiscal 2005 and increased 27 percent on a comparable 13-week basis over fiscal 2004, primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts and, to a lesser extent, growth in the emerging entertainment business.
Specialty revenues
decreased to 40.9 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to 42.3 percent for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction.
Cost of sales including occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to 41.9 percent for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) increased to 21.7 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to 18.3 percent for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures to support the Company's emerging entertainment business and to support the growth of Seattle's Best Coffee licensed caf operations. In addition, marketing expenditures were higher in support of the launch of ready-to-drink coffee beverages in Japan and Taiwan.
Other operating expenses
 
increased to $88 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $74 million for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 735 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses increased to 5.3 percent for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.1 percent for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to the extra sales week in fiscal 2004.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $101 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $81 million for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased charitable commitments and higher provisions for incentive compensation. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1 percent for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.5 percent for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004.
General and administrative expenses
increased to $29 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $24 million for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for the North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot espresso drink, and improved operating results from international investees.
Income from equity investees
increased 27 percent to $197 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $155 million for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. The operating margin increased to 11.8 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to 10.7 percent for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. This improvement was due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, offset in part by higher general and administrative and other operating expenses.
Operating income
for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, resulted in an effective tax rate of 38.1 percent, compared to 35.1 percent in the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. For the full year of fiscal 2005, the effective tax rate was 37.9 percent, compared to 37.3 percent for the full year 2004, due to a variety of factors, none of which were individually significant.
Income taxes
for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, increased 21 percent to $124 million from $103 million for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004. Earnings were $0.16 per share for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $0.12 per share for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004.

The Company's consolidated financial statements, operating segment results, and other additional information have been provided on the following pages in accordance with current year classifications.

Stock Compensation Expense
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS 123R requires Starbucks to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record compensation expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Starbucks will adopt SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method in its first fiscal quarter of 2006, which ends January 1, 2006.
The Company discloses the pro forma impact of stock compensation on the Company's net earnings and earnings per share through fiscal year end 2005 within its periodic filings with the SEC in accordance with current accounting rules. The pro forma impacts for the 13 and 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, and the 14 and 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, were as follows for the information presented ():

Business Acquisitions
In July 2005, Starbucks increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in Southern China and Chile, to 51 percent and 100 percent, respectively, for a combined purchase price of $15 million. Previously, Starbucks owned less than 20 percent in each of these operations, which were accounted for under the cost method. These increases in equity ownership resulted in a change of accounting method, from the cost method to the consolidation method, on the respective dates of acquisition. This accounting change also included adjusting previously reported information for the Company's proportionate share of net losses in Southern China and Chile. The cumulative effect of the accounting change for previously reported information resulted in a reduction of net earnings of $0.1 million for the 39 weeks ended July 3, 2005, and a reduction of retained earnings of $0.4 million prior to fiscal 2005.

The increase in comparable store sales was due to a five percent increase in the average value per transaction, including three percent attributable to a beverage price increase in October 2004, and a four percent increase in the number of customer transactions.
Total United States specialty revenues increased by $22 million to $216 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $194 million in the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, United States specialty revenues increased 20 percent. United States licensing revenues increased to $140 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 17 percent on a comparable 13-week basis, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 596 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. United States foodservice and other revenues increased to $76 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 27 percent on a comparable 13-week basis, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, as well as growth in the emerging entertainment business.
United States operating income increased by 28 percent to $239 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from $187 million for the 14-week period in fiscal 2004. This improvement was primarily due to the increase in revenues discussed above. Operating margin increased to 17.3 percent of related revenues from 15.3 percent in the 14-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, which favorably impacted cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses. This improvement was partially offset by higher payroll-related expenditures to support the emerging entertainment business and to support the growth of Seattle's Best Coffee licensed caf operations.
International
International total net revenues increased by $51 million to $279 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $229 million for the 14-week period of fiscal 2004.

Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, international Company-operated retail revenues increased 31 percent, primarily due to the opening of 161 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of six percent for the quarter and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate for the Canadian dollar. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a four percent increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a two percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Total international specialty revenues increased to $50 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $41 million in the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, international specialty revenues increased 33 percent. International licensing revenues increased to $44 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 33 percent on a comparable 13-week basis, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 341 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, volume driven growth in the Canadian grocery and warehouse club businesses and, to a lesser extent, the launch of new ready-to-drink coffee
 
beverages in Japan and Taiwan. International foodservice and other revenues increased 31 percent from fiscal 2004, on a comparable 13-week basis, due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.
International operating income increased by 54 percent to $30 million for the 13 weeks ended October 2, 2005, compared to $20 million in the 14-week period of fiscal 2004. This increase was due to both revenue growth and margin improvement. Operating margin increased to 10.9 percent of related revenues from 8.6 percent in the 14-week period of fiscal 2004, due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues, partially offset by increased other operating expenses related to launching the new ready-to-drink coffee beverages in Japan and Taiwan.
