     In accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Starbucks Corporation insider trading policy, James L. Donald, the Company's president and chief executive officer, entered into a selling plan on November 21, 2005. Under the selling plan, Mr. Donald will sell 150,000 shares of the Company's common stock on January 3, 2006 so long as the market price of the common stock is higher than a minimum threshold price specified in the plan. The number of shares subject to the selling plan represents less than 5% of Mr. Donald's total Company stock holdings, including vested and unvested stock option shares, as of November 17, 2005.
     Rule 10b5-1 permits an insider to implement a written prearranged trading plan entered into at a time when the insider is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company and allows the insider to trade on a one-time or regularly scheduled basis regardless of any material nonpublic information about the Company thereafter received by the insider.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
