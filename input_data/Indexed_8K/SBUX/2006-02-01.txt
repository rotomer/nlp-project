Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On February 1, 2006, Starbucks Corporation (the "Company") issued an earnings release announcing its financial results for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006. A copy of the earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
     Effective October 3, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), requiring all share-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment using the modified-prospective transition method, as permitted under SFAS 123R; therefore results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), the attached press release (at page 8) includes certain "non-GAAP financial measures" under applicable SEC rules because they exclude the share-based payment expense that is included in the directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, to which the non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled in a table. The non-GAAP financial measures provided on page 8 of the attached press release and calculated in this manner are: cost of sales including occupancy costs, store operating expenses, other operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, operating income, earnings before income taxes, income taxes, net earnings and net earnings per common sharediluted. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for the reported GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
     The Company's management finds these non-GAAP financial measures useful, and believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations, because they have been prepared on a basis comparable to that used in prior periods. Management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Company, both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to review financial results because the Company's internal budgets and targets (including under the Company's incentive compensation plans) for fiscal 2006 were established prior to the Company's adoption of SFAS 123R. Therefore, assessing performance against those budgets and targets, and the related management reporting, requires exclusion of share-based compensation expense. Management further believes that, where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP (pro forma) net earnings and net earnings per common sharediluted are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the consolidated statement of earnings, investors may find it useful to know how these specific line items in the consolidated statement of earnings are affected by these adjustments. In particular, now that the Company has adopted SFAS 123R, management believes investors may find it useful to understand how the expenses recorded as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R are reflected in its consolidated statement of earnings.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced record earnings for its fiscal first quarter for the period ended January 1, 2006, and revenues for the four-week period ended January 29, 2006.
SEATTLE; February 1, 2006 
Fiscal First Quarter 2006 Results:
January 2006 Revenue Highlights:
Updated Fiscal 2006 Target:
For the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, consolidated net revenues increased 22 percent to $1.9 billion from $1.6 billion for the same period in fiscal 2005, and net earnings increased 20 percent to $174 million from $145 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.22 for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to a split-adjusted $0.17 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2005. The Company adopted the new accounting requirements related to expensing stock-based compensation in the first fiscal quarter of 2006, which reduced net earnings by $0.02 per share in the quarter.
"I am very pleased with our first quarter performance, which demonstrated focused execution at all levels of the business and delivered the most successful first quarter in Starbucks history," commented Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman. "Our core beverages, coupled with a strong holiday promotion, drove results in our retail stores, while solid growth in licensed locations led to the increase in our specialty business revenues. We ended the first quarter with a strong foundation for Starbucks fiscal year 2006 which gave us the confidence to raise our full year earnings per share target range by $0.05 per share to $0.68 to $0.70 per share."
 
"Building on the success of our first quarter, we are proud that revenue results for the month of January were just as impressive," commented Jim Donald, Starbucks president and ceo. "Due to the strength of the Starbucks brand and the exemplary execution of our holiday promotion, a record number of Starbucks Cards were activated during the holiday season and are bringing valued customers, both existing and new, into Starbucks stores in record numbers. We are very pleased with 10 percent comparable store sales growth in January, but we also recognize that same store sales growth at this level is not sustainable. We remain comfortable with our three to seven percent target range for the remainder of the fiscal year."
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 20 percent to a record $1.6 billion for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $1.4 billion for the same period in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 803 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of seven percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a six percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a one percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Company-operated retail revenues
increased 33 percent to a record $306 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $231 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. Licensing revenues increased 39 percent to $219 million primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 1,049 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 18 percent to $87 million due to growth in both new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts.
Specialty revenues
decreased to 40.2 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to 40.8 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher occupancy costs in the prior year resulting from store maintenance activities, as well as fixed rent costs in the current year being distributed over an expanded revenue base.
Cost of sales including occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 38.2 percent for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to 38.3 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payroll-related expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by recognition of stock-based compensation expense in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 related to new accounting requirements. Additional details on this new accounting standard can be found on page 8.
Store operating expenses
 
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) increased to 19.3 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to 19.2 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense.
Other operating expenses
increased to $91 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $79 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 803 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 4.7 percent for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to 4.9 percent for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $123 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $84 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures from stock-based compensation and higher provisions for incentive compensation based on the Company's strong operating results for the fiscal first quarter of 2006, as well as increased charitable contributions. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.4 percent for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to 5.3 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005.
General and administrative expenses
increased to $20 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $13 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks Doubleshot coffee drinks, and improved results from international investees primarily as a result of new licensed retail store openings.
Income from equity investees
increased 23 percent to $280 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $227 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 14.5 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to 14.3 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, offset in part by higher general and administrative expenses.
Operating income
, decreased to $0.3 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $5.1 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to interest expense recognized on the borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, which was entered into in August of 2005.
Interest and other income, net
 
for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, increased 20 percent to $174 million from $145 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Earnings were $0.22 per share for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $0.17 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2005.

Stock-based Compensation Expense
Effective October 3, 2005, the beginning of Starbucks first fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R requires all stock-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment using the modified prospective transition method, as permitted under SFAS 123R; therefore results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. Accordingly, stock-based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes. The Company is providing the table below because management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations by separately identifying the stock-based compensation expense and providing reported amounts on a basis comparable to that used in prior periods. In addition, the Company's internal reporting and budgeting, as well as the calculation of its incentive compensation payments, includes the use of reported amounts excluding stock-based compensation. The amounts shown in the column below entitled "Using Previous Accounting" are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under applicable SEC rules because they exclude the stock-based payment expense that is included in the directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States, which are shown in the column entitled "As Reported." These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for the reported GAAP measures.
The application of SFAS 123R had the following effect on reported amounts for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006 relative to the amounts that would have been reported using the intrinsic value method under the Company's previous accounting ():

Segment Results
Segment information is prepared on the basis that the Company's management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. The tables below present, by operating segment, total net revenues, operating income and operating income as a percentage of related revenues, net of intersegment eliminations for the periods ended
(in thousands):
 
 
United States
United States total net revenues increased by $282 million, or 21 percent, to $1.6 billion for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $1.3 billion for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased by $221 million, or 19 percent, to $1.4 billion for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $1.1 billion for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to the opening of 634 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of seven percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a six percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a one percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Total United States specialty revenues increased by $61 million, or 32 percent, to $250 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $189 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased 40 percent to $170 million from $121 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 651 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. United States foodservice and other revenues increased to $80 million, or 18 percent, from $68 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.
United States operating income increased by 28 percent to $339 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $266 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 20.9 percent of related revenues from 19.8 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to store operating and general and administrative expenses distributed over an expanded revenue base. Although store operating expenses as a percentage of U.S. Company-operated retail revenues remained at 38.6 percent for both 13-week periods ended January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, these expenses as a percentage of U.S. total net revenues improved by 60 basis points compared to the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily due to the specialty revenue component of total net revenues growing at a higher rate than Company-operated retail revenues, as noted above.
International
International total net revenues increased by $63 million, or 25 percent, to $314 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $251 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. International Company-operated retail revenues increased by $48 million, or 23 percent, to $257 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $209 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to the opening of 169 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of eight percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a five percent increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a three percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Total international specialty revenues increased by $14 million, or 35 percent, to $56 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $42 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. International licensing revenues increased $14 million, or 38 percent, to $50 million, compared to $36 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 398 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and sales of ready-to-drink coffee beverages introduced in Japan and Taiwan in September 2005, and in Korea in late October 2005. International foodservice and other revenues increased 16 percent from the corresponding period of fiscal 2005 due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.
International operating income increased by 79 percent to $35 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $20 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 11.3 percent of related revenues from 7.9 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses as a percentage of total International net revenues. Also contributing to the margin expansion was an increase in income from equity investees, particularly from Japan and Korea, due to an increase in the Company's store base as well as improved comparable same store sales. Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in other operating expenses for marketing and advertising related to the recent launch of Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee beverages in Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
 
Unallocated Corporate
Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $94 million for the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2006, compared to $58 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenses from stock-based compensation and higher provisions for incentive compensation based on the Company's strong operating results for the quarter, as well as increased charitable contributions. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 4.8 percent for the 13-weeks ended January 1, 2006 compared to 3.7 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005.
