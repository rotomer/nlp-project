     In accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Starbucks Corporation insider trading policy, Paula E. Boggs, the Company's executive vice president, general counsel and secretary, entered into a selling plan on February 3, 2006. Under the selling plan, between March 6, 2006 and the plan's termination date of February 3, 2007, Ms. Boggs will sell a total of 71,800 shares of the Company's common stock so long as the market price of the common stock is higher than a minimum threshold price specified in the plan. Up to 35,900 shares of common stock may be sold beginning March 6, 2006, and up to 35,900 additional shares of common stock may be sold beginning July 3, 2006.
     Rule 10b5-1 permits an insider to implement a written prearranged trading plan entered into at a time when the insider is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company and allows the insider to trade on a one-time or regularly scheduled basis regardless of any material nonpublic information about the Company thereafter received by the insider.
