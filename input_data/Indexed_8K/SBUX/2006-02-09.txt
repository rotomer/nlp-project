Exhibit 99.1
Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) announced today that its shareholders overwhelmingly approved management's proposal to amend its articles of incorporation and eliminate the classification of the Company's Board of Directors. The declassification means that all directors will be elected to one-year terms beginning with the 2007 Annual Meeting.
SEATTLE; Feb. 8, 2006 
"Management's proposal to declassify the Board demonstrates Starbucks Board of Directors commitment to good corporate governance practices," said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman. "The Board believes that the annual election of directors is a primary means for shareholders to influence corporate governance policies and hold management accountable for implementing those policies."
Currently, the Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with the directors in each class standing for election at every third annual meeting of shareholders. To facilitate the transition from classified three-year terms to non-classified one-year terms, each director whose term would not otherwise expire at the 2007 Annual Meeting has agreed to tender his or her resignation effective immediately prior to the 2007 Annual Meeting.
