     On March 3, 2006, Starbucks Corporation ("Starbucks") received a letter from Gregory B. Maffei resigning from the Starbucks Corporation Board of Directors and from his position as Chair of Starbucks Audit and Compliance Committee, effective March 3, 2006. Mr. Maffei wrote that he was promoted on March 1, 2006 to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Media Corporation, ahead of the company's originally planned schedule. Mr. Maffei had been serving as CEO-Elect of Liberty Media since November 2005. Mr. Maffei stated that the increased demands on his time arising from his new position with Liberty Media would make it difficult for him to continue to serve on the Starbucks Board. The Starbucks Board of Directors has not yet selected Mr. Maffei's successor as Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board.
