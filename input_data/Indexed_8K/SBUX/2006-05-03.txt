Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On May 3, 2006, Starbucks Corporation (the "Company") issued an earnings release announcing its financial results for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006. A copy of the earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
     Effective October 3, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), requiring all share-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment using the modified-prospective transition method, as permitted under SFAS 123R; therefore results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), the attached press release (at page 9) includes certain "non-GAAP financial measures" under applicable SEC rules because they exclude the share-based payment expense that is included in the directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, to which the non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled in a table. The non-GAAP financial measures provided on page 9 of the attached press release and calculated in this manner are: cost of sales including occupancy costs, store operating expenses, other operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, operating income, earnings before income taxes, income taxes, net earnings and net earnings per common sharediluted. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for the reported GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
     The Company's management finds these non-GAAP financial measures useful, and believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations, because they have been prepared on a basis comparable to that used in prior periods. Management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of the Company, both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to review financial results because the Company's internal budgets and targets (including under the Company's incentive compensation plans) for fiscal 2006 were established prior to the Company's adoption of SFAS 123R. Therefore, assessing performance against those budgets and targets, and the related management reporting, requires exclusion of share-based compensation expense. Management further believes that, where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP (pro forma) net earnings and net earnings per common sharediluted are based on specific, identified charges that impact different line items in the consolidated statement of earnings, investors may find it useful to know how these specific line items in the consolidated statement of earnings are affected by these adjustments. In particular, now that the Company has adopted SFAS 123R, management believes investors may find it useful to understand how the expenses recorded as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R are reflected in its consolidated statement of earnings.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced record earnings for its fiscal second quarter for the period ended April 2, 2006, revenues for the four-week period ended April 30, 2006, and updated targets for fiscal 2006.
SEATTLE; May 3, 2006 
Fiscal Second Quarter 2006 Results:
April 2006 Revenue Highlights:
Updated Fiscal 2006 Targets:
For the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, consolidated net revenues increased 24 percent to $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion for the same period in fiscal 2005, and net earnings increased 27 percent to $127 million from $100 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.16 for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to a split adjusted $0.12 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2005. The Company adopted the new accounting requirements related to expensing stock-based compensation at the beginning of its fiscal 2006 year, which reduced net earnings by $0.02 per share in the second quarter.
"Our outstanding quarterly results reflect diligent execution throughout our business," commented Jim Donald, Starbucks president and ceo. "Continued innovation and an expanding retail footprint allowed us to reach more customers through more channels worldwide than any time in the history of Starbucks, and keeps the Company on track to achieve our long-term growth targets."
 
Donald added, "We started the third quarter with strong 23 percent revenue growth in April and six percent comparable store sales growth  near the top of our three to seven percent target range. These results were driven by continued customer demand for our handcrafted beverages, with particular strength in our spring line up of Green Tea beverages."
"Our strong first half performance  and increased confidence in our second half forecast  has allowed us to raise our full year earnings per share target and narrow the range to $0.71 to $0.72 from the prior range of $0.68 to $0.70," commented Michel Casey, Starbucks chief financial officer. "We are very pleased with our year-to-date results and believe that we have laid a solid foundation toward achieving our targets and delivering superior value to our shareholders."
Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary
increased 25 percent to $1.6 billion for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, from $1.3 billion for the same period in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 874 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of ten percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to an eight percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a two percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Company-operated retail revenues
increased 22 percent to $286 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $235 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. Licensing revenues increased 25 percent to $202 million primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,090 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 14 percent to $84 million primarily due to growth in the U.S. foodservice business.
Specialty revenues
improved to 40.3 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to 41.4 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily due to fixed rent costs in the current year being distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as higher occupancy costs in the prior year resulting from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable items, together with other lesser improvements, offset higher green coffee costs in the second quarter.
Cost of sales including occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased slightly to 41.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, from 41.5 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures for incentive compensation based on the Company's strong operating results in fiscal 2006 and the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. The increase was partially offset by higher costs in the prior year associated with the North American leadership conference held for retail management employees, as well as leverage gained from higher retail revenues. Regional leadership conferences in fiscal 2006 will be held during the Company's third fiscal quarter.
Store operating expenses
 
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) increased to 22.3 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to 19.7 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense as well as higher payroll-related expenditures to support the expansion of U.S. and International licensed retail store businesses.
Other operating expenses
increased to $95 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $88 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 874 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 5.0 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, from 5.8 percent for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $120 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $82 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures from stock-based compensation, additional employees to support continued global growth and higher provisions for incentive compensation based on the Company's strong operating results in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.3 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, from 5.4 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005.
General and administrative expenses
increased 23 percent to $20 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $16 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot coffee drinks, and improved results from international investees primarily as a result of additional licensed retail stores.
Income from equity investees
increased 28 percent to $202 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $157 million for the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 10.7 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to 10.4 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs, offset in part by higher general and administrative expenses.
Operating income
for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, increased 27 percent to $127 million from $100 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Earnings per share were $0.16 for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $0.12 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2005.

Stock Compensation Expense
Effective October 3, 2005, the beginning of Starbucks first fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R requires all stock-based compensation, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment using the modified prospective transition method, as permitted under SFAS 123R; therefore results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. Accordingly, stock-based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes. The Company is providing the table below because management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations by separately identifying the stock-based compensation expense and providing reported amounts on a basis comparable to that used in prior periods. In addition, the Company's internal reporting and budgeting, as well as the calculation of its incentive compensation payments, includes the use of reported amounts excluding stock-based compensation. The amounts shown in the column below entitled "Using Previous Accounting" are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under applicable SEC rules because they exclude the stock-based payment expense that is included in the directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States, which are shown in the column entitled "As Reported." These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for the reported GAAP measures.
The application of SFAS 123R had the following effect on reported amounts for the 13 and 26 weeks ended April 2, 2006 relative to the amounts that would have been reported using the intrinsic value method under the Company's previous accounting ():

The tables below present operating segment results net of intersegment eliminations for the 26 weeks ended April 2, 2006
(in thousands):
 
 
United States total net revenues increased by $294 million, or 23 percent, to $1.6 billion for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $1.3 billion for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased by $253 million, or 23 percent, to $1.3 billion, primarily due to the opening of 660 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of ten percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to an eight percent increase in the number of customer transactions and a two percent increase in the average value per transaction.
United States
Total United States specialty revenues increased by $41 million, or 21 percent, to $232 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $192 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased 26 percent to $156 million from $124 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 685 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. United States foodservice and other revenues increased to $77 million, or 13 percent, from $68 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.
United States operating income increased by 36 percent to $266 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, from $196 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 16.9 percent of related revenues from 15.4 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to leverage gained from fixed costs, including occupancy, depreciation and general and administrative expenses, distributed over an expanded revenue base in the current year period, and to higher costs in the prior year period for intensified store maintenance activities in Company-operated retail stores.
International total net revenues increased by $73 million, or 30 percent, to $315 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $242 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. International Company-operated retail revenues increased by $63 million, or 31 percent, to $262 million, primarily due to the opening of 214 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of nine percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a seven percent increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a two percent increase in the average value per transaction.
International
Total international specialty revenues increased by $11 million, or 24 percent, to $54 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $43 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 405 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and expansion of the Canadian grocery and warehouse club business.
International operating income increased by 29 percent to $22 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $17 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. Operating margin decreased slightly to 7.1 percent of related revenues from 7.2 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses and an increase in other operating expenses for expanding infrastructure to support global growth, as well as increased retail store operating expenses related to higher provisions for incentive compensation. These were partially offset by lower costs of sales including occupancy costs due primarily to leverage gained from fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as improvements in the food program.
Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $87 million for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to $56 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenses from stock-based compensation, higher provisions for incentive compensation based on the Company's strong operating results for the quarter and additional employees to support continued rapid global growth. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 4.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 2, 2006, compared to 3.7 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2005.

Store Data
The Company's store data for the periods presented are as follows:
 
April 2006 Revenues
Starbucks Corporation today also reported consolidated net revenues of $597 million for the four-week period ended April 30, 2006, an increase of 23 percent from consolidated net revenues of $487 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. On a comparable store sales basis (stores open for at least 13 months), sales at Company-operated stores increased six percent for the four weeks ended April 30, 2006, as compared to the same four-week period in fiscal 2005.
For the 30 weeks ended April 30, 2006, consolidated net revenues were $4.4 billion, an increase of 23 percent from consolidated net revenues of $3.6 billion for the same 30 week period in 2005.

April's comparable store sales growth  near the top of the Company's three to seven percent target range  was driven primarily by sales of handcrafted beverages, including new seasonal offerings as well as core beverages, and food. Strong customer demand for Starbucks Green Tea beverages led to robust blended beverage sales during the month.
