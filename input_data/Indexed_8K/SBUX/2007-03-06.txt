Pace, the Company's executive vice president, Partner Resources, entered into a selling plan effective March 1, 2007. Under the selling plan, between April 23, 2007 and December 31, 2007, Mr. Pace will sell a total of 60,000 shares of the Company's common stock so long as the market price of the common stock is higher than a minimum threshold price specified in the plan.
