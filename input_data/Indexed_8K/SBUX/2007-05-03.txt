SEATTLE; May 3, 2007  Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced financial results for
its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, 2007.
Fiscal Second Quarter 2007 Highlights:
"We are pleased with the strength of our business  reflected by solid revenue growth and the opening of 560 new stores during the quarter," said Jim Donald, Starbucks president and ceo. "We continue to build a solid global foundation, which will enable us to execute our strategy and realize the tremendous growth opportunities available to Starbucks. We remain committed to and believe we are well-positioned to continue building shareholder value."
Michael Casey, Starbucks chief financial officer, commented, "During the second quarter, we demonstrated our ability to deliver solid performance and effectively manage our operations despite difficult comparisons and a more challenging cost environment this year. As a result, we recorded operating margin that was comparable to last year's record second-quarter performance while continuing to substantially expand our business."
increased 20 percent to $1.9 billion for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, from $1.6 billion for the same period in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 1,279 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of four percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a three percent increase in the average value per transaction and a one percent increase in the number of customer transactions.
Consolidated Financials and Operating Summary
Company-operated retail revenues
 
increased 16 percent to $333 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $286 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Licensing revenues increased 16 percent to $235 million primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,224 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 17 percent to $98 million primarily due to growth in new and existing accounts in the U.S. foodservice business.
Specialty revenues
increased to 41.9 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to 40.3 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to a shift in sales to higher cost products, increased distribution costs due to the Company's expanding store base and food programs, and higher rent expense attributed to growth in higher priced real estate markets.
Cost of sales including occupancy costs
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, from 41.6 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) increased to 22.7 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to 22.3 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing costs related to expansion of ready-to-drink coffee beverages in the Asia-Pacific region.
Other operating expenses
increased to $113 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $95 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,279 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses were 5.0 percent for both periods.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $126 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $120 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures and professional fees in support of continued global growth, partially offset by lower provisions for incentive compensation due to exceptional performance in the prior year. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.6 percent for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, from 6.3 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006.
General and administrative expenses
increased 31 percent to $26 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $20 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily from the North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages, including Starbucks bottled Frappuccinocoffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot espresso drinks, and higher equity income from international investees.
Income from equity investees
 
increased 19 percent to $241 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $202 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Operating margin was 10.7 percent of total net revenues for both the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007 and April 2, 2006. For the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, higher cost of sales including occupancy costs were offset by lower store operating expenses and lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.
Operating income
, decreased to expense of $0.6 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to income of $3.1 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher borrowings and higher interest rates on the Company's revolving credit facility.
Interest and other income, net
for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007 resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.2 percent, compared to 37.9 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006.
Income taxes
for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007 increased 18 percent to $151 million from $127 million for the same period in fiscal 2006. Earnings per share increased by 19 percent to $0.19 for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $0.16 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2006.

Segment Results
The tables below present reportable segment results net of intersegment eliminations for the 13 and 26 weeks ended April 1, 2007
(in thousands):
United States
 
United States total net revenues increased by $280 million, or 19 percent, to $1.8 billion for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $1.5 billion for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased by $244 million, or 18 percent, to $1.6 billion, primarily due to the opening of 1,042 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of three percent for the quarter resulting from a three percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Total United States specialty revenues increased by $36 million, or 23 percent, to $194 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $158 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. United States licensing revenues increased 29 percent to $105 million from $81 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 768 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. United States foodservice and other revenues increased by 17 percent to $89 million, from $77 million in fiscal 2006, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.
United States operating income increased by 16 percent to $268 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, from $231 million for the same period in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 15.0 percent of related revenues from a record second quarter high of 15.3 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The decrease was due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs, primarily due to a shift in sales to higher cost products such as food and merchandise, higher rent expenses, and increased distribution costs due to expansion of the Company's store base and food programs. Partially offsetting this was lower store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance.
 
International
 
International total net revenues increased by $89 million, or 30 percent, to $387 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $298 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. International Company-operated retail revenues increased by $79 million, or 32 percent, to $327 million, primarily due to the opening of 237 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of seven percent for the quarter and favorable foreign currency exchange for the British pound sterling. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a five percent increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a two percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Total International specialty revenues increased by $10 million, or 21 percent, to $60 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $50 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 456 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.
International operating income increased by nine percent to $21 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $19 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 5.5 percent of related revenues from 6.5 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher other operating expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues resulting from increased payroll-related expenditures to support continued rapid international store growth.
 
Global Consumer Products Group (CPG)
CPG total net revenues increased by $0.6 million, or one percent, to $79 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $78 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased product sales and royalties in the International ready-to-drink business. Partially offsetting this was decreased shipments into the U.S. packaged coffee and tea distribution system, despite higher sales to grocery retailers, resulting in lower inventory levels throughout the system.
CPG operating income was $38 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, relatively flat with the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 47.8 percent of related revenues, from 48.6 percent in fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased other operating expenses. The increase in other operating expenses was due to higher marketing expenditures to support continued international expansion of ready-to-drink beverages. Partially offsetting the increase in other operating expenses was higher income from equity investees, attributable to the ready-to-drink beverage business in the U.S.
 
Unallocated Corporate
Unallocated corporate expenses decreased to $85 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007, compared to $87 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006.
