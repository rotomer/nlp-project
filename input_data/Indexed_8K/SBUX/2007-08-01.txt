Reporting Fiscal Third Quarter 2007 Highlights
:
Maintaining Fiscal 2007 Targets:
Introducing Fiscal 2008 Targets:
 
"In the third quarter, Starbucks delivered solid financial performance while expanding globally," said Jim Donald, Starbucks president and ceo. "Record store openings helped drive revenue growth of 20 percent. Starbucks ability to balance strong top line growth, global expansion, and delivering a solid bottom line in a challenging environment was due to the hard work and dedication of our partners across the Company. Despite the difficult operating environment of rising expenses  particularly higher dairy costs  we continued to execute on our growth strategy. We will strive to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures while remaining focused on delivering legendary service to our customers."
Consolidated Financials and Operating Summary
increased 21 percent to $2.0 billion for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, from $1.7 billion for the same period in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 1,369 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of four percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a three percent increase in the average value per transaction and a one percent increase in the number of customer transactions.
Company-operated retail revenues
increased 15 percent to $348 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $303 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Licensing revenues increased 18 percent to $255 million primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,243 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 24 percent increase in licensing revenues from the Company's Global Consumer Products business.
Specialty revenues
increased to 42.6 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to 41.0 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to a shift in sales to higher cost products, the rise in dairy costsand higher rent expense.
Cost of sales including occupancy costs
,
as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.7 percent for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, from 41.3 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to controlled discretionary spending.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the Company's specialty operations) decreased to 22.0 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to 23.0 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The decline resulted primarily from lower marketing and advertising costs in fiscal 2007.
Other operating expenses
 
increased to $119 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $99 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,369 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses increased slightly to 5.1 percent for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, from 5.0 percent for the corresponding period in fiscal 2006.
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased to $120 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $115 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of continued global growth. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.1 percent for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, from 5.9 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006.
General and administrative expenses
decreased 5 percent to $25 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $26 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to lower sales volumes for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages, including Starbucks bottled Frappuccinocoffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot.
Income from equity investees
increased 14 percent to $245 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $215 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 10.4 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, from 10.9 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Higher cost of sales including occupancy costs were offset, in part, by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses.
Operating income
was an expense of $2.2 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to income of $5.0 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to a higher level of borrowings outstanding.
Net interest and other
for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007 reflected an effective tax rate of 34.8 percent, compared to 33.7 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 37 percent for the full fiscal year of 2007.
Income taxes
for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007 increased 9 percent to $158 million from $145 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2006. Earnings per share increased by 17 percent to $0.21 for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $0.18 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2006.

(in thousands):
United States
 
 
United States total net revenues increased by $284 million, or 18 percent, to $1.8 billion for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $1.6 billion for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased by $265 million, or 19 percent, to $1.6 billion, primarily due to the opening of 1,116 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of four percent for the quarter resulting from a three percent increase in the average value per transaction and growth in transactions of less than one percent.
Total United States specialty revenues increased by $19 million, or 11 percent, to $194 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $175 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. United States licensing revenues increased 14 percent to $110 million from $96 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 777 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.
United States operating income increased by 12 percent to $253 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, from $225 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 13.8 percent of related revenues from 14.5 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The decrease was due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs, primarily due to higher dairy costs, a shift in sales to higher cost products such as food and merchandise, and higher rent expenses. Partially offsetting these were lower other operating expenses, lower general and administrative expenses, and lower store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. The decline in both other operating expenses and store operating expenses was primarily due to controlled discretionary spending. General and administrative expenses were lower, primarily due to decreased salary and related benefits expense as well as lower professional fees.

CPG total net revenues increased by $17 million, or 24 percent, to $87 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, compared to $70 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006.

Unallocated Corporate

Balance Sheet Commentary
Management is currently evaluating a range of alternatives for raising long-term financing to enable Starbucks to pay down short-term debt and take advantage of opportunities for repurchasing shares. These include a long-term bond financing and/or an interim credit facility containing terms substantially similar to those contained in the Company's existing revolving credit facility. Any funding would be consistent with the Company's strategy of targeting leverage and coverage levels to be roughly commensurate with a high triple B rating over the medium term.
     During the third quarter, the Company repurchased a total of 2.5 million shares. For the nine months ended July 1, 2007, Starbucks had repurchased 20.3 million shares. Under authorized plans, approximately 26 million shares remained available for repurchase at the end of the fiscal third quarter.
