Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On August 20, 2007 (the "Effective Date"), Starbucks Corporation (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Banc of America Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., acting on behalf of themselves and the other underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), for the public offering of $550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due August 15, 2017 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes were issued under a base indenture dated as of August 23, 2007 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of August 23, 2007 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee. The issuance and sale of the Senior Notes closed on August 23, 2007. The Company will pay interest on the Senior Notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2008. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Senior Notes, after deducting expenses and underwriter discounts, are approximately $545.3 million.
     The underwriters and their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, commercial and investment banking services for the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees. In addition, affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Banc of America Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are lenders under (i) a 364-day credit facility the Company entered into on August 7, 2007 and (ii) a $1 billion revolving credit facility under a credit agreement dated August 12, 2005, as amended, which serves as a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program. The lender affiliates of the underwriters will receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering in repayment of outstanding indebtedness under the 364-day credit facility.
     The Senior Notes were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ASR (the "Registration Statement") (File Number 333-145572), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 20, 2007, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 21, 2007.
     The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, conditions to closing, indemnification and contribution rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, will limit the ability of the Company to create certain liens to: secure other indebtedness; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company's assets. The Indenture provides for customary events of default. Upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture), the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. In addition, the Company may redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part prior to their maturity at any time at a price that includes a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
     The foregoing descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Senior Notes and the Supplemental Indenture do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the form of Senior Note and the form of Supplemental Indenture, each of which is filed as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

          (h) To pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act;

               (i) Each of the Company and Starbucks Coffee International, Inc. is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Washington, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus;
               (ii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
               (iii) The Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and, when executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms; and the Securities and the Indenture conform to the descriptions thereof in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus;
               (iv) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other
 
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
               (v) The issue and sale of the Securities by the Company pursuant to the Agreement and the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement and the Indenture and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated do not: (i) result in a breach of or a default under any of the material contracts, as amended through the date of this Agreement, listed on the exhibit index to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, and to the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2006, April 1, 2007 and July 1, 2007; (ii) result in any violation of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, in each case as currently in effect; (iii) violate the Washington Business Corporation Act or any federal, Washington or New York statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company; or (iv) require any consent, approval or authorization to be obtained by the Company from, or any registrations, filings or qualifications to be made by the Company with, any governmental agency or body under any federal, Washington or New York statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company except as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations, filings or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters;
               (vi) The statements set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, and under the caption "Underwriting" solely as such statements relate to the contents of this Agreement, insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate descriptions or summaries in all material respects;
               (vii) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof, will not be an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act; and
               (viii) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any further amendments and supplements thereto, as applicable, made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; it being understood, however, that such counsel expresses no view with respect to Regulation S-T. For purposes of this paragraph, such counsel may assume that the statements made in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus are correct and complete.
          In addition, such opinion shall also contain a statement that such counsel has participated in conferences and telephone conversations with officers and representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company and the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the final term sheet in the form attached as Schedule I hereto and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed; although they do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness
 
or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (vi) of this Section 8(c), no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that lead such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief), including the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) as of its date and as of the Time of Delivery, the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
          (d) Andrew M. Paalborg, Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary for the Company, shall have furnished to you his written opinion (a form of such opinion is attached as Annex III hereto), dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:
               (i) Each of the Company and Starbucks Coffee International, Inc. has been duly organized under the laws of the State of Washington. All of the issued shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrance, equities or claims;
               (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in violation of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or equivalent or comparable constitutive documents), in each case as currently in effect, or in default in the performance or observance of any material contract, as amended through the date of this Agreement, listed on the exhibit index to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, and to the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2006, April 1, 2007 and July 1, 2007;
               (iii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus and are not so described; and
               (iv) The documents incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to
 
which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and they have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when such documents became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading;
          (e) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto (the executed copy of the letter delivered prior to the execution of this Agreement is attached as Annex I(a) hereto and a form of letter to be delivered on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement and as of the Time of Delivery is attached as Annex I(b) hereto);
          (f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (other than changes due to repurchases or the Company's common stock under the Company's share repurchase program previously announced and described in the Pricing Prospectus, and changes due to issuances of the Company's common stock in the ordinary course of business under the Company's existing share-based employee benefits and options plans described in the Pricing Prospectus) or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
          (g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under
 
surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
          (h) On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the Nasdaq Global Select Market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by Federal, New York State or Washington State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in your judgment makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
          (i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement;
          (j) The Securities shall be eligible for clearance and settlement through DTC; and
          (k) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the final term sheet in the form attached hereto as Schedule I, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the final term sheet in the form attached
 
hereto as Schedule I, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
          (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the final term sheet in the form attached hereto as Schedule I, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, the final term sheet in the form attached hereto as Schedule I, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director
 
of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.

DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium or interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required no later than five days after becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.
          13. . The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.
