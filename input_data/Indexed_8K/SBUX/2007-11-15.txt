Starbucks Experience
 
Consolidated net revenues increased 22 percent to $2.4 billion for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $2.0 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. Net earnings totaled $159 million in the fourth quarter 2007 versus $117 million for the same period a year ago. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter rose to $0.21 from $0.15 in the prior year period. Net earnings and earnings per share in fiscal 2006 included a one-time cumulative accounting charge of $17 million or $0.02 per share recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 resulting from the company's adoption of the new accounting requirements of FIN 47, which addresses asset retirement obligations. Excluding the cumulative effect of the adjustment, fiscal 2007 fourth quarter earnings grew 18 percent and earnings per share increased 24 percent.
Fiscal Year 2007 in Review
Fiscal year 2007 consolidated net revenues increased 21 percent to $9.4 billion, compared to $7.8 billion for the 52 weeks ended October 1, 2006. Company-operated retail revenues in fiscal 2007 rose 21 percent to $8.0 billion from $6.6 billion in fiscal 2006, predominantly due to the opening of 1,342 stores and comparable store sales growth of five percent. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a four percent increase in the average value per transaction and one percent growth in the number of customer transactions. Specialty revenues grew 17 percent to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2006.
For fiscal 2007, operating income increased to $1.1 billion, compared to $894 million for fiscal 2006. Operating margin contracted 30 basis points to 11.2 percent of total net revenues for the full year ended September 30, 2007, from 11.5 percent for the same period a year ago. Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by lower general and administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.
Net earnings rose to $673 million in fiscal 2007 from $564 million for the previous year. Earnings per share for the period increased to $0.87 compared to $0.71 a year ago. Excluding the adjustment for FIN 47 in fourth quarter 2006, earnings grew 16 percent and earnings per share increased 19 percent.
Fourth Quarter Summary of Results
increased 21 percent to $2.1 billion for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, from $1.7 billion for the same period in fiscal 2006, resulting primarily from opening 1,342 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of four percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a four percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Company-operated retail revenues
 
increased 24 percent to $383 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $309 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Licensing revenues increased 27 percent to $283 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, driven by revenue growth of 44 percent from the company's Global Consumer Products business, and from higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.
Specialty revenues
increased to 43.7 as a percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to 41.7 percent in the corresponding 13-week period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher dairy costs.
Cost of sales including occupancy
as a percentage of company-operated retail revenues improved to 41.0 percent for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, from 42.1 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The improvement was due to the benefit gained from price increases coupled with leverage on regional overhead, partially offset by higher payroll expenditures from wage increases for retail store partners.
Store operating expenses
(expenses associated with the company's specialty operations) decreased to 19.5 percent of total specialty revenues for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to 21.4 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The improvement resulted primarily from lower payroll-related expenditures as a percentage of total specialty revenues.
Other operating expenses
as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 5.0 percent for the fourth quarter fiscal 2007, from 5.8 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The improvement was a result of leveraging of the company's scale and infrastructure against continued global growth.
General and administrative expenses
increased to $248 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $198 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Operating margin increased 30 basis points to 10.2 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, from 9.9 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Lower store operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues more than offset the increase in cost of sales including occupancy.
Operating income
was an expense of $1.2 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to income of $3.9 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to a higher level of borrowings outstanding, which include the $550 million senior notes issued in August 2007.
Net interest and other
 
Fourth Quarter Results  United States
United States total net revenues increased 19 percent to $1.9 billion for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $1.6 billion for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. United States company-operated retail revenues increased 19 percent to $1.7 billion, primarily due to the opening of 1,065 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of four percent for the quarter. Comparable store sales growth was due to a five percent increase in the average value per transaction, which included the impact of price increases taken during the fiscal year, partially offset by a one percent decrease in number of transactions.
Total United States specialty revenues increased 16 percent to $201 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $173 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. United States licensing revenues in the fourth quarter 2007 increased 17 percent to $111 million from $95 million for the same period a year ago. The growth was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 723 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.
United States operating income increased 12 percent to $225 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, from $201 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 12.1 percent of related revenues from 12.8 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The decrease was driven by higher cost of sales including occupancy costs, primarily due to higher dairy costs.
Fourth Quarter Results  International
International total net revenues increased 31 percent to $472 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $361 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. International company-operated retail revenues increased 32 percent to $399 million, primarily due to the opening of 277 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, favorable foreign currency exchange for the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar, and comparable store sales growth of six percent for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a five percent increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a one percent increase in the average value per transaction.
Total International specialty revenues increased by $13 million, or 23 percent, to $73 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $59 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The growth was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 506 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.
International operating income increased to $51 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $27 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. Operating margin increased 350 basis points to 10.8 percent of related revenues from 7.3 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses and lower store operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues, as well as higher income from equity investees.
 
Fourth Quarter Results  Global Consumer Products Group
For the Global Consumer Products Group (CPG), total net revenues increased by $33 million, or 44 percent, to $110 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $76 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher sales of U.S. packaged coffee and tea and increased product sales and royalties in the international ready-to-drink business.
CPG operating income increased to $62 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2007, compared to $47 million in the same period of fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 56.9 percent of related revenues from 61.8 percent in fiscal fourth quarter 2006. Contraction of operating margin for the quarter was due to slower growth in income from equity investees from The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages.
Fourth Quarter Results  Unallocated Corporate Expenses
Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues improved to 3.7 percent for the 13-weeks ended September 30, 2007, from 3.8 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006, primarily due to leverage from growth.
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet
For the 52 weeks ended September 30, 2007, net cash flow from operating activities totaled $1.3 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2007 were $1.1 billion, of which approximately 80 percent was used to fund new store openings and existing store remodels.
On August 23rd, the company issued $550 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due in August 2017. The proceeds were primarily used to repay short-term borrowings and fund additional share repurchases.
During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased a total of 12.6 million shares at a cost of $342 million. During fiscal year 2007, Starbucks repurchased 33.0 million shares at a cost of $1.0 billion.
