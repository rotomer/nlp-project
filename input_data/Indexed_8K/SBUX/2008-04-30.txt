Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On April 30, 2008, Starbucks Corporation issued an earnings release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March 30, 2008. A copy of the earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
SEATTLE; April 30, 2008  Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended March 30, 2008 and provided updated information about its revenue expectations for fiscal 2008, expanding on the preliminary results announced by the company on April 23, 2008. The company also announced its financial targets for the three-year period of fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2011.
Consolidated net revenues increased 12 percent to $2.5 billion for the second quarter of 2008, compared to $2.3 billion for the second quarter of 2007. For the 13-week period ended March 30, 2008, net earnings totaled $108.7 million versus $150.8 million for the same period a year ago, a decline of 28 percent. Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was $0.15, down 21 percent from the $0.19 per share earned in the prior year period. The company estimates that costs associated with the implementation of its transformation agenda and charges related to the rationalization of its store portfolio negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share.
"Fiscal 2008 is a transitional year for Starbucks and, while our financial results are clearly being impacted by reduced frequency to our U.S. stores, we believe that as we continue to execute on the initiatives generated by our transformation agenda, we will reinvigorate the for our customers, and in doing so, deliver increased value to our shareholders," commented Howard Schultz, chairman, president and ceo.
Starbucks Experience
Schultz continued, "Over the past several months, we have evaluated our business to assess the opportunities to better leverage resources and gain efficiencies in our cost structure, while continuing to invest in our innovation pipeline to create customer demand. We believe this balanced approach, which includes substantially reducing our planned U.S. store openings and lowering our capital spending, will allow us to set the stage for the next evolution of Starbucks and lead to significant improvement in our long-term financial performance."
Second Quarter Financials
The 12 percent growth in consolidated net revenues in the second quarter 2008 was heavily influenced by the U.S. business, which contributed 77 percent of total net revenue. Lower than expected revenue was driven by a mid-single-digit decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by decreased traffic. For the quarter, U.S. total net revenues increased by $146.9 million, or 8 percent, to $1.9 billion mainly due to increased revenues from company-operated retail stores. International total net revenues expanded 27 percent, or $106.1 million, to $493.4 million for the 13 weeks ended March 30, 2008 as the company continued to expand its store presence in its 43 markets outside the U.S. For the Global Consumer Products Group (CPG), total
 
net revenues increased by $17.4 million, or 22 percent, to $96.3 million for the second quarter fiscal 2008, primarily due to increased sales of packaged coffee and tea.
Consolidated cost of sales including occupancy costs increased 190 basis points to 43.8 percent of total net revenues for the 13 weeks ended March 30, 2008, compared to 41.9 percent in the corresponding period in fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher occupancy costs and higher dairy costs as a percent of revenues, in the U.S. business.
Store operating expenses as a percentage of related company-operated retail revenues rose 270 basis points to 43.3 percent in the second quarter 2008, from 40.6 percent for the prior year period. In addition to softer revenues, expenses rose during the period, which contributed to the increase as a percent of related revenues. The largest expense drivers were charges associated with rationalization of the company's store portfolio and costs related to its transformation agenda initiatives.
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues improved 100 basis points to 4.7 percent for the second quarter 2008, from 5.7 percent for the corresponding period of fiscal 2007. The favorability was primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses.
Consolidated operating income declined 26 percent to $178.2 million for the 13 weeks ended March 30, 2008. Operating margin contracted 360 basis points to 7.1 percent of total net revenues in the second quarter, from 10.7 percent for the same period a year ago, due to the softness in U.S. revenues along with higher store operating expenses and cost of sales including occupancy costs.
For second quarter fiscal 2008, United States operating income declined by 27.5 percent to $193.9 million. Operating margin contracted 500 basis points to 10.0 percent of related revenues from 15.0 percent in the corresponding period of fiscal 2007. The decrease was driven by lower than expected revenues, higher store operating expenses and higher cost of sales including occupancy costs.
International operating income declined 15.6 percent to $17.8 million for the second quarter 2008. Operating margin contracted 180 basis points to 3.6 percent of related revenues from 5.4 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The primary reasons for this decline were costs associated with rationalization of the store portfolio and higher cost of sales including occupancy costs.
Operating income for the CPG segment increased to $42.7 million for the 13 weeks ended March 30, 2008, a 13.3 percent increase over second quarter 2007. Operating margin contracted 350 basis points to 44.3 percent of related revenues from 47.8 percent for the prior year period, due to lower income from equity investees resulting from product write-offs within the NACP partnership.
For the first half of fiscal 2008, consolidated net revenues increased 15 percent to $5.3 billion, compared to $4.6 billion for the same period a year ago. Net earnings totaled $316.8 million for the 26-week period ended March 30, 2008, versus $355.8 million for the first half of fiscal 2007, down 11 percent, while EPS for the period decreased 7 percent to $0.43 from $0.46 in the first half of fiscal 2007.
 
Full-Year 2008 Updates
As indicated in the April 23, 2008 announcement, Starbucks expects full-year fiscal 2008 EPS to be somewhat lower than the $0.87 reported in fiscal 2007. The company is not providing a more precise expectation, due to the lack of visibility into near-term economic conditions. In line with this revised view, Starbucks anticipates total net revenue growth of 13 percent to 14 percent in fiscal year 2008.
In the second quarter, Starbucks continued to refine its planned fiscal 2008 U.S store openings given the current economic environment and its impact on financial results. The company lowered its U.S. store opening targets for fiscal 2008 to approximately 1,020 net new stores; 620 company-operated and 400 licensed stores. International store openings are expected to remain as previously announced at 975 stores. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2008 are still expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, as the reduction in store opening investment is being offset by investment in the company's transformation agenda around innovation.
Schultz added, "The second half of 2008 marks the beginning of an exciting wave of meaningful innovation coming to life in our stores. The summer launch of our new, distinctive cold beverage platform will bring the excitement and uniqueness that our customers expect, deserve and will continue to see more of as we execute on our transformation agenda and reaffirm our leadership position."
Longer-Term Financial Targets: 2009  2011
Today, Starbucks is announcing the following key financial and operational metrics to provide more clarity regarding its financial targets beyond 2008. The company believes this will assist investors in measuring Starbucks progress against the transformation and evolution of the company.
Pete Bocian, executive vice president and cfo, commented, "Despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we are focused on the parts of the business we can control such as: store count, use of capital, and controlling expenses, while still investing for the long term. We believe our plan balances these key objectives and drives long-term shareholder value."
Investment in Stores
Starbucks plans to open significantly fewer new stores in the U.S., over the 2009 to 2011 period, to less than 400 net new stores per year, opening approximately 250 company-operated stores in each of the three years. At the same time, the company plans to continue to accelerate its International unit expansion, targeting net new store openings as follows; approximately 1,050 in 2009, 1,150 in 2010, and 1,300 in 2011. Including a somewhat lower 2008 store target for the U.S., total store count will be approximately 21,500 stores by the end of fiscal 2011, with the company's international presence growing from approximately 30 percent to over 40 percent of the global store portfolio.
Use of Capital
The company expects capital expenditures of roughly $800 million per year, beginning in fiscal 2009. Of this amount, approximately 70 percent will be for investment in stores.
 
Revenue Growth
Starbucks is targeting International revenue growth at a compound annual growth rate of 20 percent over the three-year period, driven by new store openings and continued growth in existing stores. CPG is expected to grow at least 15 percent per year, through product and channel expansion. The U.S. segment is expected to continue to grow, but at a slower pace than in previous years, in line with the slowing of new store openings, and more conservative expectations of same store sales growth that assumes a continued difficult consumer economic environment. For the U.S. segment, Starbucks is expecting revenue growth of about 5 percent in 2011, with a three-year compound annual growth rate of just over 6 percent. Total company revenues are expected to be just over $14 billion in 2011, representing a 10 percent three-year compound annual growth rate, with growth moderating slightly over the three-year period.
Earnings Per Share (EPS) Expansion
The company is providing EPS target ranges for each year, with broader ranges reflecting both greater uncertainty of projecting years farther out, as well as the near-term uncertainty of the economic environment. For fiscal 2011, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.50. For fiscal 2010, Starbucks anticipates EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. In 2009, the company is targeting an EPS range of $0.90 to $1.00, as it will continue to invest in its transformation agenda, with the benefits still in the early stages.
Operating Margin Targets
Starbucks expects International operating margin improvements of approximately 100 basis points per year, reaching about 12 percent in 2011. CPG operating margin is expected to remain flat with fiscal 2007 at 50 percent each year over the 2009 to 2011 period. Operating margin for the U.S. segment is expected to stabilize after 2008, at an average of approximately 11.5 percent from 2009 to 2011. Total company operating margin is expected to improve over the three-year period from the 2008 level, but will remain below 2007 operating margin of 11.2 percent, driven by the erosion in the U.S. business.
In addition, the company expects to gain leverage of approximately one percent of revenues from unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses by 2011 from the level in fiscal 2007, with improvement proportionately over the four-year period due to the company's cost saving initiatives. Starbucks also expects its tax rate to continue to improve over the horizon with an effective tax rate of 34 percent in fiscal 2009, and 33 percent in 2010 and 2011, due to a greater contribution to operating income from the International segment.
Free Cash Flow Generation
In line with the targets referenced above, the company expects to generate over $4.4 billion in cash from operating activities and have $2.4 billion in capital expenditures, leading to $2 billion in cumulative free cash flow from 2009 through 2011. This compares to an aggregate expected free cash flow of close to $800 million from 2006 through 2008, derived from an expected $3.8 billion of cash from operating activities and $3 billion in capital expenditures. Starbucks defines free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures. The company intends to use this excess cash to return value to shareholders through share repurchases, or drive increased value through investment in new opportunities with attractive expected returns on capital.
