Shares Subject to the Plan
          (a) . The shares of Common Stock reserved under this Plan will include reserved shares of Common Stock that are not subject to a grant or as to which the option award granted has been forfeited under the Former Plans, and an additional 24,000,000 shares of Common Stock.

Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be increased by any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding awards under the Former Plans on the date of shareholder approval of the Plan that later cease to be subject to such awards for any reason other than such awards having been exercised, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Section 5, which shares of Common Stock shall, as of the date such shares cease to be subject to such awards, cease to be available for grant and issuance under the Former Plans, but shall be available for issuance under the Plan. The Shares may be authorized but unissued, or reacquired shares of Common Stock.

Securities Law Compliance
          (d) .

The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 4(a) may be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Awards before and after the substitution.
Substitutions and Assumptions
     . If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan and (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award.

In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 5, the Committee may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including the restrictions of applicable law and the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and in light of such factors may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 5, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."
Section 5.
Adjustments to Shares Subject to the Plan

If an Option is in tandem with a SAR, such that the exercise of the Option or SAR with respect to a Share cancels the tandem SAR or Option right, respectively, with respect to each Share, the tandem Option and SAR rights with respect to each Share shall be counted as covering but one Share for purposes of the Maximum Annual Participant Award.

Procedure
 
 
exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records.

Shares used to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date. Payment of the aggregate exercise price by means of tendering previously-owned shares of Common Stock shall not be permitted when the same may, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, cause the Company to record a loss or expense as a result thereof.
Method of Payment
          (c) . To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, the Committee may and/or a Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise with respect to any Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option, SAR, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or any sale of Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue Shares or to recognize the disposition of such Shares until such obligations are satisfied. These obligations may be satisfied by having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued to a Participant under such Award or by tendering Shares previously acquired by the Participant in accordance with rules established by the Committee from time to time.
Withholding Obligations
          (d) . Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award.
Shareholder Rights
          (e) . An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in exchange for consideration, except that an Award may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant; unless the Committee permits further transferability, on a general or specific basis, in which case the Committee may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.

     (b) shall not be transferable by the Optionee or by operation of law other than (i) by will of, or by the laws of descent and distribution applicable to, a deceased Optionee, (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order; (iii) to the extent permitted by the Board or Committee, to one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved form who may exercise the Option after the Optionee's death; and/or (iv) in the case of Nonqualified Stock Options, by gift to a Family Member of the Optionee;
     (c) unless transferred as permitted by Section 3.5(b), shall automatically terminate and expire upon any other sale or transfer, any other attempted sale or transfer or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Optionee or Optionee's estate;
     (d) shall grant no right to the Optionee to receive any dividend on or to vote or exercise any right with respect to any Shares unless and until the Optionee has exercised Stock Options for such Shares and Beneficial Ownership of such Shares has been transferred to the Optionee;

     (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, upon approval of the Company's shareholders, the Committee may provide for, and the Company may implement, a one-time-only option exchange offer, pursuant to which certain outstanding Options could, at the election of the person holding such Option, be tendered to the Company for cancellation in exchange for the issuance of a lesser amount of Options with a lower exercise price, provided that such one-time-only option exchange offer is commenced within six months of the date of such shareholder approval.
     
3.6 Exercise of Options
     An Optionee, an Optionee's personal representative or a permitted transferee desiring to exercise Stock Options granted and exercisable hereunder shall notify the Company or, if required by the Company, the brokerage firm designated by the Company to facilitate exercises and sales under this Plan, specifying the number of Stock Options to be exercised. The notification to the brokerage firm shall be made in accordance with procedures of such brokerage firm approved by the Company. The notification to the Company or the designated brokerage firm shall be accompanied by (i) payment of the aggregate exercise price of the Stock Options in cash or by tender of Shares that have been held by the Optionee for at least six (6) months that have an aggregate Fair Market Value of at least the aggregate exercise price, (ii) a request that the designated brokerage firm conduct a cashless exercise of the Stock Options, or (iii) in the case of Nonqualified Stock Options only, a request that the Company withhold sufficient Shares to pay the aggregate exercise price and an attestation that the Optionee or the permitted transferee has held a number of shares equal to the number to be withheld to pay the aggregate exercise price for at least six (6) months. Payment of the aggregate exercise price by means of tendering or attesting to the ownership of previously-owned shares of the Company's common stock shall not be permitted when the same may, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, cause the Company to record a loss or expense as a result thereof.
     
3.7 Recapitalization.
     The aggregate number of Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Stock Options granted hereunder, the number of Stock Options previously granted hereunder and the exercise price per Share for each Stock Option previously granted hereunder shall be proportionately adjusted for an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split or reverse split or any other capital adjustment. The Board may, in its discretion, authorize the proportionate adjustment to the maximum number of Stock Options that may be granted to an Optionee in any one year. If the exercise of the adjusted number of Stock Options results in an obligation of the Company to issue a fractional Share, the number of Shares to be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. Under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to issue fractional shares pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options granted under this Plan. All adjustments made pursuant to this Section shall be determined by the Board or the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding, and conclusive.
 
     
3.8 Substitutions and Assumptions.
     The Board or the Committee shall have the right to substitute or assume Stock Options in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other "corporate transactions" as that term is defined in and said substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
     
3.9 Amendment or Termination of the Plan.
     This Plan and all rules, guidelines, and regulations adopted with respect hereto may be terminated, suspended, modified, or amended at any time by a majority vote of the Board or the Committee, provided, however, that the following modifications or amendments require approval of or ratification by the shareholders of the Company: (i) any increase in the number of Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Stock Options granted under the Plan, other than in connection with any adjustment under Section 3.7 of this Plan; and (ii) any change in Section 3.5(h) that would permit the exercise price of Stock Options to be set at an amount less than Fair Market Value of a Share of Common Stock on the date of grant. The Board or the Committee may amend the terms and conditions of outstanding Stock Options, provided, however, that (i) no such amendment would adversely affect the holders of such Stock Options without the holders' consent, (ii) no such amendment shall change the length of the term of a Stock Option, and (iii) the amended provisions of such Stock Options would be permitted under this Plan.
     
3.10 Withdrawal.

     In addition to the provisions of Section 3 above, the following paragraph shall apply to all Stock Options granted under this Plan that are not Incentive Stock Options.

     The amount to be paid by the Optionee, his or her personal representative or permitted transferee upon the exercise of Nonqualified Stock Options shall be the full aggregate exercise price thereof, together with the amount of federal, state, and local income and FICA taxes required to be withheld by the Company. The Optionee, his or her personal representative, or permitted transferee may elect to pay the federal, state, or local income and FICA withholding tax in cash, by having the designated brokerage firm forward payment of such taxes to the Company from the proceeds of a cashless exercise, or by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the amount required to be withheld, such withholding to be done at the minimum tax rate required under applicable law. If Shares are to be withheld to pay required taxes, the Optionee, his or her personal representative or permitted transferee must deliver an attestation that he or she has held a number of Shares equal to the number to be withheld to pay such taxes for at least six (6) months.
5. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE SOLELY TO INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS
     In addition to the provisions of Section 3 above, the following paragraphs shall apply to all Stock Options granted under this Plan that are Incentive Stock Options.

     Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan shall conform to, be governed by, and be interpreted in accordance with the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder as amended from time to time, including, without limitation, those provisions of Section 422 of the Code that prohibit an Incentive Stock Option by its terms to be exercisable after ten (10) years from the date that it was granted. Only Employees of the Company or of a "subsidiary corporation" within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code may be granted Incentive Stock Options hereunder. To the extent that Stock Options granted hereunder as Incentive Stock Options fail to conform to the foregoing requirements, such Stock Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
     
5.2 Limitation on Amount of Incentive Stock Options.
     The aggregate Fair Market Value of shares subject to Incentive Stock Options (determined on the date of grant) that vest in any one calendar year (under this Plan or any other plan of the Company that authorizes Incentive Stock Options) shall not exceed the maximum amount allowed in any one year by the Code in connection with the grant of Incentive Stock Options.
     
5.3 Limitation on Grants to Substantial Shareholders.
     An Employee may not, immediately prior to the grant of Incentive Stock Options hereunder, own stock in the Company representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company unless the exercise price per Share specified by the Board or the Committee, as the case may be, for Incentive Stock Options granted to such an Employee is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant and such Stock Options, by their terms, are not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant. For purposes of this limitation, Section 425(d) of the Code governs the attributes of stock ownership.
6. FOREIGN EMPLOYEES OR CONSULTANTS
     Without amending the Plan, the Board or the Committee may grant Stock Options to eligible Employees or Consultants who are foreign nationals on such terms and conditions not inconsistent with those specified in this Plan as may, in the judgment of the Board or the Committee, as the case may be, be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan. In furtherance of such purposes, the Board or the Committee may approve such modifications, amendments, procedures, sub-plans, and the like as may be necessary or advisable to comply with the provisions of the laws in other countries in which the Company operates or has Employees or Consultants.
7. COSTS AND EXPENSES
     Except as provided herein with respect to the payment of taxes, all costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.

Effect of Change in Control

               A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an acquisition by (i) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined);
               (b) Cessation for any reason of the individuals who are members of the Board as of August 28, 2000 (the "Incumbent Board") to constitute at least two-thirds of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for election by the Company's common shareholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of this Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided further, however, that no individual shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or
               (c) The consummation of:
     (i) A merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the Company or in which securities of the Company are issued, unless such merger, consolidation or reorganization is a "Non-Control Transaction." A "Non-Control Transaction" shall mean a merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the Company or in which securities of the Company are issued where:
 
     (A) the shareholders of the Company, immediately before such merger, consolidation or reorganization, own directly or indirectly immediately following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately before such merger, consolidation or reorganization,
     (B) the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing for such merger, consolidation or reorganization constitute at least two-thirds of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation, or a corporation directly or indirectly beneficially owning a majority of the Voting Securities of the Surviving Corporation, and
     (C) no Person other than (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary, (iii) any employee benefit plan (or any trust forming a part thereof) that, immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or reorganization, was maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iv) any Person who, immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities or Shares, has Beneficial Ownership of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then outstanding voting securities or its common stock.
(ii) A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or
     (iii) The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any Person (other than a transfer to a Subsidiary).
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding Shares or Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Shares or Voting Securities by the Company which, by
 
reducing the number of Shares or Voting Securities then outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Shares or Voting Securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Shares or Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Shares or Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.
          Section 5.9 set forth above applies to any Option granted or Change in Control occurring after June 4, 1998; provided, however, that in the event that the adoption of Section 5.9 as set forth above is considered to be an alteration of equity interests in contemplation of a pooling of interests transaction, the adoption of Section 5.9 shall be automatically rescinded. Upon the rescission of the adoption of Section 5.9 set forth above, the effect of a merger, consolidation, tender or takeover bid shall be governed by the terms of Section 2.6 of the Plan in effect prior to June 4, 1998.
