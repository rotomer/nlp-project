Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Credit Agreement
On November 17, 2010, Starbucks Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and each of the Lenders a party thereto.
The Credit Agreement provides for a $500,000,000 unsecured, revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to mature on November 17, 2014 (of which $100,000,000 may be used for the issuances of letters of credit). Provided there is no default, the Company may, from time to time, request an increase in the aggregate commitments by an amount not exceeding $500,000,000 for a total aggregate facility commitment not to exceed $1,000,000,000.
The current interest rate for any borrowings under the Credit Agreement, based on the Company's current ratings, is 1.50% over LIBOR. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio. During an event of default under the Credit Agreement, interest on the outstanding amount of the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% in excess of the interest then borne by such borrowings.
The Credit Agreement contains provisions requiring the Company to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1. The Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, invalidity of any loan document, material judgments, bankruptcy and insolvency events, and change of control, subject, in certain instances, to cure periods. Obligations under the Credit Agreement may be declared due and payable upon the occurrence of such events of default.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference as though it were fully set forth herein. The description above is a summary of the Credit Agreement, does not provide a complete description of the Credit Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Credit Agreement itself.
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 17, 2010, in connection with the Company's entry into the Credit Agreement discussed in Item 1.01, the Company terminated the Credit Agreement, dated August 12, 2005 and as amended, among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, Wachovia Bank N.A. and Citibank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents, Banc of America Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and the other Lenders party thereto.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, the Company is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, it will make such payment in US Dollars in the US Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 1:00 p.m., in the case of payments in US Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, will in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee will continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Company will come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment will be made on the next following Business Day, except (i) as otherwise set forth in the definition of Interest Period, (ii) that no payment will extend past the Maturity Date or the end of the Availability Period, or (iii) as otherwise agreed between the Company and Bid Lender with respect to a Bid Loan, and such extension of time will be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Company to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Company, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Company and such Lender will pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent will promptly remit to the Company the amount of such interest paid by the Company for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid will constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Company will be without prejudice to any claim the Company may have against a Lender that will have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in US Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, US Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in US Dollars, to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans, will be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Company will, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in US Dollars, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate),
3.02 Illegality.
 
either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Company will also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in US Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan (whether denominated in US Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans in the affected currency or currencies will be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(iv) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing will be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Company will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

Capital Requirements
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in  or  of this Section and delivered to the Company will be conclusive absent manifest error.
