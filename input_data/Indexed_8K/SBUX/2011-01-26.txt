Exhibit 99.1
SEATTLE; January 26, 2011  Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended January 2, 2011. The previously-announced restructuring program, which was in effect during the fiscal 2008-2010 period, was completed at the end of fiscal year 2010. As a result, there are no restructuring charges reflected in fiscal Q1 2011.

"Our holiday lineup, bolstered by Christmas Blend and Starbucks Christmas VIA along with the world-class service of our partners, resonated well with customers and led to record results for the quarter," said Howard Schultz, chairman, president and ceo. "The strength in our top line  combined with continued improvement in operations  continues a recent trend of record quarterly operating profits and margins, enabling us to more than offset the impact of unusually high coffee costs. As Starbucks approaches our 40th anniversary in March 2011, we look forward to taking full advantage of the many exciting growth opportunities that exist for us all around the world."
"Starbucks delivered another record-breaking quarter as our customers continue to respond favorably to new offerings and an improved store experience," commented Troy Alstead, cfo. "The strong momentum in our global business in fiscal 2011 positions us to deliver 15% to 20% EPS growth compared to last year's results, and to reaffirm our 2011 guidance despite dramatically higher coffee costs. Through the strength of our global retail business and the exciting future growth opportunities in consumer products and Seattle's Best Coffee, we are on track with our plans to grow and diversify Starbucks and pursue a larger share of global coffee consumption," added Alstead.

Consolidated net revenues were a record $3.0 billion for Q1 FY11, an increase of 8% over Q1 FY10. The increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in global comparable stores sales, comprised of a 5% increase in the number of transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket.
Operating income for Q1 FY11 totaled a record $501.9 million, representing operating margin expansion of 400 basis points to a record 17.0%. This improvement was primarily due to sales leverage on occupancy costs and store operating expenses, partially offset by higher coffee costs.

International net revenues were a record $640.0 million in Q1 FY11, an increase of 9% over Q1 FY10. The increase was primarily due to a 5% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 2% increase in the number of transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket. Also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in specialty revenue due to higher royalties and product sales related to our existing licensed stores, and the opening of 267 net new licensed stores over the last 12 months.
International operating income increased to $104.5 million in Q1 FY11, compared to $42.9 million for the same period a year ago, with the related operating margin expanding 900 basis points to 16.3% from 7.3% in Q1 FY10. The margin increase was primarily driven by sales leverage on both occupancy costs and store operating expenses. Also contributing to the margin improvement were lower impairment charges compared to the prior-year period.
 
Q1 Global Consumer Products Group Segment Results
 
CPG net revenues were $195.2 million in Q1 FY11, an increase of 12% over Q1 FY10. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sales in our U.S. packaged coffee and Starbucks VIA Ready Brew businesses.
Operating income for the CPG segment was $67.5 million in Q1 FY11 compared to $63.9 million in Q1 FY10, with the operating margin decreasing to 34.6% of net revenues from 36.6% in the prior-year period, due primarily to higher coffee costs.

Fiscal First Quarter 2011 Store Data

Non-GAAP Disclosure
In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share (non-GAAP EPS) for fiscal 2010. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share (non-GAAP EPS) are operating income, operating margin, and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.
The non-GAAP financial measures provided in this release exclude 2010 restructuring charges, primarily related to previously-announced company-operated store closures. The company's management believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures better enables investors to understand and evaluate the company's historical and prospective operating performance. More specifically, for historical non-GAAP financial measures, management excludes restructuring charges because it believes that these costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
