Starbucks opened 241 net new stores globally, reaching 500 stores in both mainland China and Latin America

st
EPS increased 11% to a record $0.50 per share, compared to $0.45 per share in Q1 FY11
"Starbucks continues to expand our global footprint and accelerate the innovation and momentum in our CPG business, said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman, president and ceo. Our first quarter performance represents the highest quarterly earnings in the history of the company, and is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our 200,000 partners (employees) around the world. Starbucks is firing on all cylinders and taking full advantage of the many global opportunities that lie ahead," Schultz added.
"Our first quarter results demonstrate the fundamental strength of the Starbucks business and the powerful momentum we carried into fiscal 2012, commented Troy Alstead, cfo. A very successful holiday season drove strong global same store sales, which, combined with continued operational efficiencies, delivered record results despite continued commodity cost pressures. We are well positioned to continue to drive strong revenue and profit growth throughout this year, and in years to come.
Consolidated net revenues reached a record $3.4 billion in Q1 FY12, an increase of 16% over Q1 FY11. The increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in global comparable stores sales, and 72% growth in the CPG segment. The 9% increase in comparable store sales was comprised of a 7% increase in the number of transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket. Additionally, licensed store revenue growth of 21% contributed to overall consolidated net revenues.
Consolidated operating income increased to $556.0 million in Q1 FY12, compared to $501.9 million for the same period a year ago. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 16.2% in Q1 FY12 compared to 17.0% in the prior-year period. This margin contraction was due to higher commodity costs. The increase in commodity costs, primarily coffee, negatively impacted Q1 FY12 operating income and operating margin by approximately $105 million and 300 basis points, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year.
Net revenues for the Americas segment were $2.6 billion in Q1 FY12, an increase of 11% over Q1 FY11. The increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in comparable store sales, driven by strong sales performance in the U.S. Additionally, licensed store revenue growth of approximately 25% contributed to the Americas segment results. Comparable store sales growth in the U.S. of 9% was comprised of an 8% increase in the number of transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket.
Operating income increased to $563.2 million in Q1 FY12, compared to $527.0 million for the same period a year ago. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 21.8% in Q1 FY12 compared to 22.6% in the prior-year period. The margin contraction was due to higher commodity costs.
Net revenues for the EMEA segment were $303.0 million in Q1 FY12, an increase of 17% over Q1 FY11. The increase was due to an increase in company-operated store revenues, primarily driven by incremental revenues from the consolidation of the Switzerland and Austria markets.
Operating income decreased to $19.8 million in Q1 FY12, compared to $25.2 million for the same period a year ago. Operating margin was 6.5% in Q1 FY12 compared to 9.7% in the prior-year period. The margin contraction was primarily driven by higher distribution costs related to the transition to a consolidated distribution center in the UK.
Net revenues for the China/Asia-Pacific segment were $166.9 million in Q1 FY12, an increase of 38% over Q1 FY11. The increase was due to incremental revenues from 85 net new company-operated store openings over the last 12 months, and a 20% increase in comparable store sales. The 20% increase in comparable stores sales was the result of a 15% increase in the number of transactions and a 5% increase in average ticket.
Operating income increased to $57.8 million in Q1 FY12, compared to $46.0 million for the same period a year ago. Operating margin was 34.6% in Q1 FY12 compared to 38.1% in the prior-year period. The margin contraction was primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation, higher operating expenses in support of the continued expansion of the region and higher commodity costs.
CPG net revenues were $335.8 million in Q1 FY12, an increase of 72% over Q1 FY11. The increase was primarily due to sales of Starbucks- and Tazo-branded K-Cup portion packs, and the benefit of recognizing the full revenue from packaged coffee and tea sales under the direct distribution model.
CPG operating income was $79.7 million in Q1 FY12 compared to $71.1 million for the same period a year ago. Operating margin was 23.7% in Q1 FY12 compared to 36.4% in the prior-year period. The margin contraction was primarily due to higher coffee costs.
Fiscal 2012 Targets
Starbucks continues to target the opening of approximately 800 net new stores globally.
Approximately 400 net new stores in the Americas, with licensed stores comprising approximately one-half of the new additions.
Approximately 300 net new stores in China and Asia Pacific, with licensed stores comprising approximately two-thirds of the new additions. One-half of the China and Asia Pacific new stores are planned for China.
Approximately 100 net new stores in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Russia and Africa), with licensed stores comprising approximately two-thirds of the new stores.
The company continues to target approximately 10% revenue growth, driven by mid-single-digit comparable store sales growth, 800 net new store openings, and strong growth in the CPG business.
Starbucks is maintaining its full-year operating margin improvement target of 50 to 100 basis points over FY11 non-GAAP results on a consolidated basis.
The company continues to expect commodity costs will add approximately $230 million of cost pressure to FY12, with the majority expected to impact the first half of the year.
Given the strong Q1 FY12 results, the company has raised its expectation for earnings per share to a range of $1.78 to $1.82, representing 17% to 20% growth over the $1.52 EPS in FY11, excluding the non-routine gains. EPS growth is expected to be approximately 10% in the first half of FY12 and approximately 25% in the second half of FY12, reflecting the expected distribution of unfavorable commodity cost impact throughout the year.

Non-GAAP Disclosure
In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share (non-GAAP EPS) for fiscal 2011. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share (non-GAAP EPS) are operating margin and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.
The fiscal 2011 non-GAAP financial measures provided in this release exclude non-routine gains from the sale of properties and the acquisition of the companys joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria in fiscal 2011. The companys management believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures better enables investors to understand and evaluate the companys historical and prospective operating performance. More specifically, for historical non-GAAP financial measures, management excludes the non-routine gains in fiscal 2011, because it believes that the impact of non-routine gains do not reflect expected future expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the companys future operating performance or comparisons to the companys past operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the companys results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
