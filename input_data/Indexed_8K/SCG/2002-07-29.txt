Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure. On July 26, 2002 SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) reported that earnings from ongoing operations for the second quarter of 2002 were $38 million, or 36 cents per share of common stock, compared to $30 million, or 29 cents per share in the second quarter of last year. In the second quarter of 2002, SCANA also recorded a non-recurring cash gain of $9 million, or 9 cents per share, related to the previously announced sale of its 800 Mhz radio network to Motorola, and a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $7 million, or 7 cents per share, related to the other than temporary decline in the market value of the Company's investment in ITC^DeltaCom, Inc. (NASDAQ: ITCDQ). Additional information regarding these non-recurring items is included below. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company had recorded a non-recurring, non-cash gain of $354 million, or $3.38 per share related to the Company's investment in Powertel, Inc., which was acquired by Deutsche Telekom AG (NYSE:DT; FSE:DTE) on May 31, 2001. Including the non-recurring items in both periods, SCANA reported consolidated earnings in the second quarter of 2002 of $40 million, or 38 cents per share of common stock, compared to $385 million, or $3.67 per share, in the second quarter of 2001. Earnings per share comparisons for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 are summarized in the following table: "Earnings from ongoing operations in the second quarter improved by 7 cents per share, or 24 percent, over the same quarter last year and were in-line with the earnings guidance we provided for the quarter," said Kevin Marsh, SCANA's senior vice president and chief financial officer. Regulated Operations South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, recorded earnings of 37 cents per share in the second quarter, down from 41 cents per share in the same period last year. "The favorable impact of warmer weather and customer growth on electric sales margins was more than offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses," said Marsh. "As measured by cooling degree days, temperatures across SCE&G's electric utility service area during the quarter were 7 percent above normal and 5 percent above last year," said Marsh. "The impact of the warmer weather increased second quarter earnings by 2 cents per share compared to the second quarter last year." The warmer weather, combined with 2.2 percent customer growth, resulted in a 4.0 percent increase in total retail kilowatt-hour sales of electricity in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Residential sales, which are the most weather sensitive, were up 5.3 percent. Commercial sales were up 3.4 percent and industrial sales rose 3.6 percent. South Carolina Pipeline, SCANA's regulated gas transmission business, recorded earnings of 3 cents per share in the second quarter, up from 2 cents per share in 2001. Those positive results primarily reflect increased margins on sales of natural gas for electric generation. PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based regulated natural gas distribution subsidiary, recorded a seasonal loss of 2 cents per share in the second quarter, compared to a loss of 5 cents per share in the same quarter last year. "That improvement was the result of the elimination this year of the goodwill amortization expense related to SCANA's acquisition of PSNC in February 2000 and slightly better sales margins resulting primarily from lower gas costs," said Marsh. Non-Regulated Operations SCANA Energy, the Company's non-regulated retail natural gas business in Georgia, recorded earnings of 1 cent per share in the second quarter of 2002 compared to a loss of 3 cents per share in the same quarter last year. "The more favorable results at SCANA Energy were driven primarily by lower bad debt expenses due to lower natural gas prices," said Marsh. The Company's corporate and other non-regulated operations lost 3 cents per share in the second quarter on a combined basis compared to a loss of 6 cents per share last year. That improvement was driven primarily by lower interest expenses and higher investment income. Explanation of Second Quarter 2002 Non-Recurring Items In the second quarter of 2002, SCANA Communications, Inc., SCANA's wholly-owned telecommunications subsidiary, recorded a non-recurring cash gain of $9 million, or 9 cents per share related to the previously-announced sale of its 800 Mhz emergency radio network to Motorola in April 2002. SCANA Communications owns a fiber optic network in South Carolina and North Carolina, provides tower construction, management and rental services for wireless providers, and, through a Delaware subsidiary, holds the Company's telecommunications investments. Also in the second quarter of 2002, SCANA recorded a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $7 million, or 7 cents per share, related to the other than temporary decline in the market value of the Company's investment in ITC^DeltaCom, Inc.(NASDAQ: ITCDQ), a publicly-held provider of integrated telecommunications and technology solutions to businesses in the southern United States. This impairment charge eliminates the Company's investment basis in ITC^DeltaCom. On June 25, 2002, ITC^DeltaCom filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, ITC^DeltaCom announced a proposed plan of reorganization that it anticipates will result in the elimination of approximately $515 million principal amount of the company's senior and subordinated note debt, thereby improving the company's capital structure and liquidity position and significantly reducing annual interest expense. Implementation of the proposed plan of reorganization is dependent on a number of factors and conditions typical in similar reorganizations, including approval of the reorganization plan by the bankruptcy court and ITC^DeltaCom's security holders. In connection with that proposed reorganization, SCANA has committed to purchase up to $15 million of a new issue of the reorganized company's convertible preferred stock. Implementation of SFAS 142 As disclosed earlier this year, on January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, a new accounting standard from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) became effective. This new standard addresses goodwill and other intangible assets recorded on a company's balance sheet and requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. In accordance with SFAS 142, and as noted above, SCANA discontinued recording amortization expense related to goodwill associated with the Company's acquisition of Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., a natural gas distribution company headquartered in Gastonia, North Carolina. This company is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCANA doing business as PSNC Energy. As required by the new statement, the Company continues to evaluate whether the goodwill associated with this transaction that is recorded on the Company's books is impaired as defined in the statement and, if so, the amount of any such impairment. While the Company's evaluation is being finalized, preliminary results indicate that the Company will be required to record a non-cash impairment in the probable range of $200 - $250 million. As required by the standard, the Company expects to complete its evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and record any required impairment by the end of 2002. Any such impairment would be recorded as the cumulative effect of the mandated accounting change.
