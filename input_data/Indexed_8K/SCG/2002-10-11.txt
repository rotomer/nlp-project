The Company has also agreed to grant to you and the other Underwriters an option (the "Option") to purchase up to an additional 750,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Shares") on the terms and for the purposes set forth in Section 1(b). The Firm Shares and the Option Shares are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Shares." The term "Representatives" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the firms and/or corporations addressed hereby. If there is only one firm or corporation to which this Agreement (the "Agreement") is addressed, such term shall be deemed to mean such firm or corporation. If there are any Underwriters in addition to yourselves, you represent that you have been authorized by each of the Underwriters to enter into this Agreement on their behalf and to act for them in the manner herein provided in all matters relating to carrying out the provisions of this Agreement. If there are no Underwriters other than yourselves, the term "Underwriters" shall be deemed to mean the Representatives. All obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are several and not joint. The initial public offering price per share for the Shares and the purchase price per share for the Shares to be paid by the several Underwriters shall be agreed upon by the Company and the Representatives, acting on behalf of the several Underwriters, and such agreement shall be set forth in a separate written instrument substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Price Determination Agreement"). The Price Determination Agreement may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication among the Company and the Representatives and shall specify such applicable information as is indicated in Exhibit A hereto. The offering of the Shares will be governed by this Agreement, as supplemented by the Price Determination Agreement. From and after the date of the execution and delivery of the Price Determination Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed to incorporate, and, unless the context otherwise indicates, all references contained herein to "this Agreement" and to the phrase "herein" shall be deemed to include, the Price Determination Agreement.
The Company confirms as follows its agreements with the Representatives and the several other Underwriters. 1. Agreement to Sell and Purchase. ------------------------------ (a) On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter named below, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company at the purchase price per share for the Firm Shares to be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company in accordance with Section 1(c) or 1(d) and set forth in the Price Determination Agreement, the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I, plus such additional number of Firm Shares which such Underwriter may become obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 8 hereof. If the Company elects to rely on Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations (as defined herein), Schedule I may be attached to the Price Determination Agreement. (b) Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company grants the Option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 750,000 Option Shares from the Company at the same price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Firm Shares. The Option may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Shares by the Underwriters and may be exercised in whole or in part at any time (but not more than once) on or before the 45th day after the date of this Agreement (or, if the Company has elected to rely on Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations, on or before the 45th day after the date of the Price Determination Agreement), upon written or telegraphic notice (the "Option Shares Notice") by the Representatives to the Company no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, at least two and no more than five business days before the date specified for closing in the Option Shares Notice (the "Option Closing Date") setting forth the aggregate number of Option Shares to be purchased and the time and date for such purchase. On the Option Closing Date, the Company will issue and sell to the Underwriters the number of Option Shares set forth in the Option Shares Notice, and each Underwriter will purchase such percentage of the Option Shares as is equal to the percentage of Firm Shares that such Underwriter is purchasing, as adjusted by the Representatives in such manner as it deems advisable to avoid fractional shares. (c) If the Company has elected not to rely on Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations, the initial public offering price per share for the Firm Shares and the purchase price per share for the Firm Shares to be paid by the several Underwriters shall be agreed upon and set forth in the Price Determination Agreement, which shall be dated the date hereof, and an amendment to the Registration Statement (as hereinafter defined) containing such per share price information shall be filed before the Registration Statement becomes effective. (d) If the Company has elected to rely on Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations, the initial public offering price per share for the Firm Shares and the purchase price per share for the Firm Shares to be paid by the several Underwriters shall be agreed upon and set forth in the Price Determination Agreement. 2. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of the Firm Shares shall be made to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters against payment of the purchase price by wire transfer in federal or other immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company to the Representatives. Such payments shall be made at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on or before the fifth business day following the date of this Agreement or, if the Company has elected to rely on Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations, on or before the fifth business day after the date on which the first bona fide offering of the Shares to the public is made by the Underwriters or at such time on such other date, as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Representatives (such date is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date"). To the extent the Option is exercised, delivery of the Option Shares against payment by the Underwriters (in the manner specified above) will take place at the offices specified above for the Closing Date on the Option Closing Date. Certificates evidencing the Shares shall be in definitive form and shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request at least two business days prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, by written notice to the Company. For the purpose of expediting the checking and packaging of certificates for the Shares, the Company agrees to make such certificates available for inspection at least 24 hours prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be. The cost of original issue tax stamps, if any, in connection with the issuance and delivery of the Firm Shares and Option Shares by the Company to the respective Underwriters shall be borne by the Company. The Company will pay and save each Underwriter and any subsequent holder of the Shares harmless from any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any failure or delay in paying Federal and state stamp and other transfer taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the original issuance or sale to such Underwriter of the Firm Shares and Option Shares. 3.

4. Agreements of the Company. ------------------------- The Company covenants and agrees with each Underwriter as follows: (a) The Company will not, either prior to the Effective Date or thereafter during such period as a prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of the Shares by an Underwriter or dealer, file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, unless a copy thereof shall first have been submitted to the Representatives within a reasonable period of time prior to the filing thereof and the Representatives shall not have objected thereto in good faith. Within the time during which a prospectus relating to the Shares is required to be delivered under the Act, the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to comply with all requirements imposed upon it by the Act, as now and hereafter amended, and by the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Shares as contemplated by the provisions hereof and the Prospectus. (b) The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective, and will notify the Representatives promptly, and will confirm such advice in writing, (1) when the Registration Statement has become effective and when any post-effective amendment thereto becomes effective, (2) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information, (3) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose or the threat thereof, (4) of the happening of any event during the period mentioned in the second sentence of Section 4(e) that makes any statement made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading and (5) of receipt by the Company or any representative or attorney of the Company of any other communication from the Commission relating to the Company, the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus. If at any time the Commission shall issue any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or shall have instituted a proceeding for that purpose, the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest possible moment. If the Company has omitted any information from the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations, the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to comply with the provisions of and make all requisite filings with the Commission pursuant to said Rule 430A and to notify the Representatives promptly of all such filings. (c) The Company will furnish to the Representatives, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement and of any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and all exhibits thereto (including any document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus), and will furnish to the Representatives, without charge, for transmittal to each of the other Underwriters, copies of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules but without exhibits, in each case in such quantities as the Underwriters may reasonably request.

(e) On the Effective Date, and thereafter from time to time, the Company will deliver to each of the Underwriters, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by the several Underwriters and by all dealers to which the Shares may be sold, both in connection with the offering or sale of the Shares and for any period of time thereafter during which the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection therewith. If at any time when a prospectus relating to the Shares is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur which in the judgment of the Company or counsel to the Underwriters should be set forth in the Prospectus in order to make any statement therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, or if it is necessary to supplement or amend the Prospectus to comply with law, the Company will forthwith prepare and duly file with the Commission, at the Company's own expense, an appropriate supplement or amendment thereto, and will deliver to each of the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies thereof as the Representatives may reasonably request. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof. The Company shall not file any document under the Exchange Act before the termination of the offering of the Shares by the Underwriters if such document would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus which is not approved by the Representatives after reasonable notice thereof.

(h) The Company will make generally available to holders of its securities as soon as may be practicable but in no event later than the last day of the fifteenth full calendar month following the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date falls, an earning statement (which need not be audited but shall be in reasonable detail) for a period of 12 months ended commencing after the Effective Date, and satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations). (i) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay, or reimburse if paid by the Representatives, all costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including but not limited to costs and expenses of or relating to (1) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement and exhibits to it, each preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (2) the preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Shares, (3) furnishing (including costs of shipping and mailing) such copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any preliminary prospectus, and all amendments and supplements thereto, as may be requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares by the Underwriters or by dealers to whom Shares may be sold, (4) the listing of the Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (5) any filings required to be made by the Underwriters with the NASD, and the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith, (6) the registration or qualification of the Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions designated pursuant to Section 4(f), including the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel to the Underwriters in connection therewith, and the preparation and printing of preliminary, supplemental and final Blue Sky memoranda, (7) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to presentations or meetings undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offer and sale of the Shares to prospective investors and the Representatives' sales forces, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged by or approved by the Company in connection with the road show representations, travel, lodging and other expenses incurred by the officers of the Company or any such consultants, and the cost of any aircraft chartered or approved by the Company in connection with the road show, (8) counsel to the Company and (9) the transfer agent for the Shares. (j) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company pursuant to any of the provisions hereof (otherwise than pursuant to Section 8) or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations hereunder, the Company will reimburse the several Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel to the Underwriters) reasonably incurred by them in connection herewith. (k) The Company will not at any time, directly or indirectly, take any action intended, or which might reasonably be expected, to cause or result in, or which will constitute, stabilization of the price of the shares of Common Stock to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Shares. (l) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the offering and sale of the Shares to be sold by the Company in the manner set forth in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds." (m) The Company will not for a period of 90 days after the commencement of the public offering of the Shares, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock or rights to acquire such shares (other than pursuant to the Company's Investor Plus Plan, the Company's Stock Purchase-Savings Plan or in connection with other employee or director incentive compensation arrangements) or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to, any additional shares of its common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its common stock, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing (other than pursuant to the Company's Investor Plus Plan, the Company's Stock Purchase Savings Plan or in connection with other employee or director incentive compensation arrangements in place as of the date hereof) without the prior written consent of the Representatives. 5.

Indemnification and Contribution. -------------------------------- (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including any and all investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted), to which they, or any of them, may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based on any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission to state in such document a material fact required to be stated in it or necessary to make the statements in it not misleading, provided that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage arises from the sale of the Shares in the public offering to any person by an Underwriter and is based on an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance on and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of any Underwriter expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, and provided further that the Company will not be liable to any Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees or agents of such Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter with respect to any loss, claim, liability, expense, charge or damage arising out of or based on any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in any preliminary prospectus which is corrected in the Prospectus if the person asserting any such loss, claim, liability, charge or damage purchased Shares from such Underwriter but was not sent or given a copy of the Prospectus at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Shares to such Person. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company might otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only insofar as losses, claims, liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance on and in conformity with information relating to any Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as such information is set forth in Section 3(b)). This indemnity will be in addition to any liability that each Underwriter might otherwise have. (c) Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 6 will, promptly after receipt of notice of any threatened claim or the commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party or parties under this Section 6, notify each such indemnifying party of such threatened claim or the commencement of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provisions of this Section 6 unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in actual prejudice to the indemnifying party caused by such omission. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (2) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (3) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (4) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties. All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred. An indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 6 is applicable in accordance with its terms but for any reason is held to be unavailable from the Company or the Underwriters, the Company and the Underwriters will contribute to the total losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company from persons other than the Underwriters, such as persons who control the Company within the meaning of the Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company, who also may be liable for contribution) to which the Company and any one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations with respect to such offering. Such relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include, for purpose of this Section 6(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by it, and no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 6(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. For purposes of this Section 6(d), any person who controls a party to this Agreement within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act will have the same rights to contribution as that party, and each director, officer, agent or employee of the Company will have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions hereof. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of any threatened claim or the commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made under this Section 6(d), will notify any such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify will not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have under this Section 6(d). No party will be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). (e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 6 and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters, (ii) acceptance of any of the Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement. 7. Termination. ----------- The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of you or any group of Underwriters (which may include you) which has agreed to purchase in the aggregate at least 50% of the Firm Shares, if, (x) since the time of execution of this Agreement or the earlier respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, there has been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the business, properties, management, financial condition, shareholders equity or results of operation of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, which would, in your judgment or in the judgment of such group of Underwriters, make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, or (y) there shall have occurred: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in your judgment or in the judgment of such group of Underwriters makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus; or (z) there shall have occurred any downgrading, or any notice shall have been given of (i) any intended or potential downgrading or (ii) any review or possible change that does not indicate an improvement, in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any subsidiary by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations. 8. Substitution of Underwriters. ---------------------------- If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase any of the Firm Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate number of Firm Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, to purchase the Firm Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase, in the proportions which the number of Firm Shares which they have respectively agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares which all such non-defaulting Underwriters have so agreed to purchase, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify; provided that in no event shall the maximum number of Firm Shares which any Underwriter has become obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by more than one-ninth of the number of Firm Shares agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter without the prior written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase any Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Firm Shares and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company for the purchase or sale of any Shares under this Agreement. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken pursuant to this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. 9. Miscellaneous. ------------- Notice given pursuant to any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and, unless otherwise specified, shall be mailed or delivered (a) if to the Company, at the office of the Company, 1426 Main Street, Columbia, South Carolina 29201, Attention: Corporate Secretary, or (b) if to the Underwriters, to the Representatives at their addresses set forth on page 1 of this Agreement. Any such notice shall be effective only upon receipt. Any notice under Section 7 or 8 may be made by telex or telephone, but if so made shall be subsequently confirmed in writing. This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the several Underwriters and the Company and of the controlling persons, directors and officers referred to in Section 6, and their respective successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. The term "successors and assigns" as used in this Agreement shall not include a purchaser, as such purchaser, of Shares from any of the several Underwriters. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Representatives under this Agreement may be taken by them jointly or by UBS Warburg LLC or Banc of America Securities LLC. UBS Warburg LLC is not a bank and is separate from any affiliated bank, including any U.S. branch or agency of UBS Warburg LLC. Because UBS Warburg LLC is a separately incorporated entity, it is solely responsible for its own contractual obligations and commitments, including obligations with respect to sales and purchases of securities. Securities sold, offered or recommended by UBS Warburg LLC are not deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are not guaranteed by a branch or agency, and are not otherwise an obligation or responsibility of a branch or agency. A lending affiliate of UBS Warburg LLC may have lending relationships with issuers of securities underwritten or privately placed by UBS Warburg LLC. To the extent required under the securities laws, prospectuses and other disclosure documents for securities underwritten or privately placed by UBS Warburg LLC will disclose the existence of any such lending relationships and whether the proceeds of the issue will be used to repay debts owed to affiliates of UBS Warburg LLC. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Except as set forth below, no claim may be commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which courts shall have jurisdiction of such courts and personal service with respect thereto. The Company hereby consents to personal jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which any claim arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement is brought by any third party against UBS Warburg LLC or any indemnified party. Each of UBS Warburg LLC and the Company (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of all indemnified parties and its and their stockholders and affiliates) waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The Company agrees that a final judgment in any such action, proceeding or counterclaim brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company and may be enforced in any other courts in the jurisdiction of which the Company is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The Company and the Underwriters each hereby irrevocably waive any right they may have to a trial by jury in respect of any claim based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 5(e) of the Underwriting Agreement dated October 9, 2002 (the "Agreement") among the Company and each of you as Representatives of the several underwriters. All capitalized terms appearing herein, unless otherwise defined herein, are used with the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement. In the preparation of this opinion, I have examined originals or photostatic or certified copies of such certificates, agreements, documents and other papers, and have made such inquiries and investigations of law, as I deemed appropriate and necessary for the opinion hereinafter set forth. In my examination, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to certain matters of fact material to the opinion expressed herein, I have relied upon certificates of various corporate officers of the Company and public officials. I assume the accuracy of the material and factual matters contained therein. Based upon the foregoing and subject to the further qualifications stated herein, I advise you that in my opinion: 1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of South Carolina; has filed all reports, paid all fees, taxes and penalties with or due to the Secretary of the State of South Carolina; is not subject to being dissolved by administrative action pursuant to the laws or regulations of the State of South Carolina; has not filed any articles of dissolution to effect the same; and has full corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, to execute and deliver the Agreement and to issue, sell and deliver the Shares as contemplated by the Agreement. 2. Each of South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated, South Carolina Pipeline Corporation, SCANA Energy Marketing, Inc. and SCANA Communications Holdings, Inc. (the "Significant Subsidiaries") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; has filed all reports, paid all fees, taxes and penalties with or due to the Secretary of the State of South Carolina or, if not organized under South Carolina law, in the comparable office of its jurisdiction of incorporation; is not subject to being dissolved by administrative action pursuant to the laws or regulations of its jurisdiction of incorporation; has not filed any articles of dissolution to effect the same; and has full corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. 3. The Company and each of the Significant Subsidiaries are duly qualified or licensed by each jurisdiction in which they conduct their respective businesses and/or in which they own or lease real property or maintain an office and in which the failure, individually or in the aggregate, to be so licensed or qualified could have a Material Adverse Effect. 4. The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. 5. The Shares have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters, will be validly issued and will be fully paid and non-assessable. 6. The Company has authorized and outstanding shares of capital stock as set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except to the extent that additional shares of Common Stock have been issued pursuant to the Company's Investor Plus Plan and the Company's Stock Purchase Savings Plan or in connection with any other employee or director incentive compensation arrangements in effect as of the date of the Agreement; the Shares when issued will be free of statutory and preemptive rights pursuant to any contract or arrangement to which the Company is a party; the certificates for the Shares are in due and proper form; and the holders of the Shares will not be subject to personal liability by reason of being such holders. 7. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Significant Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and, except as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement, are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, in each case subject to no security interest, other encumbrance or adverse claim; to my knowledge, no options, warrants or other rights to purchase, agreements or other obligations to issue or other rights to convert any obligation into shares of capital stock or ownership interests in the Significant Subsidiaries are outstanding. 8. The statements relating to the Shares contained in the Prospectus under the caption DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK are accurate and do not omit any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make such statements not misleading. 9. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and, to my knowledge, no stop order proceedings with respect thereto are pending or threatened under the Act and any required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations has been made in the manner and within the time period required by such Rule 424. 10. No approval, authorization, consent or order of or filing with any national, state or local governmental or regulatory commission, board, body, authority or agency is required in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares and consummation by the Company of the transactions as contemplated hereby other than registration of the Shares under the Act and such as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws of the various jurisdictions in which the Shares are being offered by the Underwriters, and except for the appropriate order of the Commission with respect to the sale of the Shares under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, which has been issued, and such order remains in effect at this date and constitutes valid and sufficient authorization for the sale of the Shares as contemplated by the Agreement. 11. The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not conflict with, or result in any breach of, or constitute a default under (nor constitute any event which with notice, lapse of time, or both, would result in any breach of, or constitute a default under), any provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries or under any provision of any license, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, bank loan or credit agreement or other evidence of indebtedness, or any lease, contract or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their respective properties may be bound or affected, or under any federal, state, local or foreign law, regulation or rule or any decree, judgment or order applicable to the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries. 12. To my knowledge, neither the Company nor any of the Significant Subsidiaries is in violation of its articles of incorporation or by-laws or is in breach of, or in default under (nor has any event occurred which with notice, lapse of time, or both would result in any breach of, or constitute a default under), any license, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, bank loan or credit agreement or other evidence of indebtedness, or any lease, contract or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their respective properties may be bound or affected or under any federal, state, local or foreign law, regulation or rule or any decree, judgment or order applicable to the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries. 13. To my knowledge, there are no actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings pending, threatened or contemplated to which the Company or any of the Significant Subsidiaries is subject or of which any of their respective properties is subject at law or in equity or before or by any federal, state, local or foreign governmental or regulatory commission, board, body, authority or agency, wherein an unfavorable ruling, decision or finding would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, which are required to be described in the Prospectus but are not so described. 14. No person has the right, pursuant to the terms of any contract, agreement or other instrument described in or filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or otherwise known to me, to have any securities issued by the Company and owned by them registered pursuant to the Act, included in the Registration Statement or sold in the offering contemplated thereby, whether as a result of the filing or effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, except for such rights as have been complied with or waived. I have participated in conferences with other officers and other representatives of the Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus were discussed, and I have consulted with other officers and employees of the Company to inform them of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. I have examined various reports, records, contracts and other documents of the Company and orders and instruments of public officials, which my investigation led me to deem pertinent. In addition, I participated in the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 5 of the Agreement. I have not, however, undertaken to make any independent review of other records of the Company which my investigation did not lead me to deem pertinent. As to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes the Incorporated Documents), I have relied solely on other officers of the Company without independent investigation. I accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in paragraph 8 in regard to the statements described therein. But such conferences, consultation, examination and participation disclosed to me no information with respect to such other matters that gives me reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on the date the Registration Statement became effective, or the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (in each case, except with respect to the financial statements and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus) contains on the date hereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on such date or omits on the date hereof to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing statement is provided on the basis that any statement contained in a document incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement (an "Incorporated Document") will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus prior to the date of the Agreement. I do not purport to be an expert on, or to express any opinion herein concerning, any law other than the law of the State of South Carolina and the federal law of the United States. With your permission, in rendering the opinion herein, I have assumed that the laws of the State of New York are identical to the laws of the State of South Carolina. No opinion is expressed herein as to any matters relating to state securities laws or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. This opinion is solely for your benefit. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without my prior written consent. Very truly yours, H. Thomas Arthur

This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the provisions of Section 5(f) of the Agreement. Except as set forth herein, the terms used herein which are defined in the Agreement have the same meanings as they have in the Agreement. We have examined originals or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements, and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company, and other documents as we have deemed it necessary to require as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certification by officers of the Company and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. In our examination of records and other documents, we have assumed the authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the due authority of the persons executing such documents and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have relied upon the representations contained in the Agreement, upon a certificate of the State of South Carolina officials as to the existence of the Company and upon certificates of officers of the Company as to matters of fact relevant to our opinion. We are members of the Bar of the Commonwealth of Virginia and, for purposes of this opinion, do not hold ourselves out as experts on the laws of any other state. As to all matters of South Carolina law, we have relied, with your consent, upon the opinion of H. Thomas Arthur, Esquire, General Counsel of the Company, addressed to you of even date herewith, pursuant to Section 5(e) of the Agreement. Such opinion and the opinion of the McNair Law Firm P.A. also addressed to you of even date herewith, pursuant to Section 5(e) of the Agreement, are satisfactory in form and substance to us. Based upon the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of South Carolina, and has the corporate power to transact its business as described in the Prospectus. 2. The Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; and the issuance of such Shares is not subject to any preemptive or similar rights. 3. The Registration Statement with respect to the Shares filed pursuant to the Act has become effective and remains in effect at this date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Act in connection with the offer for sale and the sale of the Shares in the manner therein specified. 4. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excepting the financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated therein by reference, any pro forma financial information and notes thereto included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, and as to which we express no belief) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. 5. The statements relating to the Shares contained in the Prospectus under the caption DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK are accurate and do not omit any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make such statements not misleading. * * * * Except as described in paragraph (5) above, we have not undertaken to determine independently the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or in the Prospectus, and as to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes statistical statements in the documents incorporated therein by reference (the "Incorporated Documents")), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement other than with regard to the statements relating to the Shares as described in paragraph (5). We note that the Incorporated Documents were prepared and filed by the Company without our participation. We have, however, participated in conferences with counsel for and representatives of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and we have reviewed the Incorporated Documents and such of the corporate records of the Company as we deemed advisable. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in the Agreement. None of the foregoing disclosed to the lawyers in this firm who have given substantive legal attention to representation of the Underwriters in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares any information that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on the date the Registration Statement became effective, or the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in all cases, excepting the financial statements and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated therein by reference, any pro forma financial information and notes thereto, included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we express no belief), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on said date or now omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is given on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document shall be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus. In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs (1) - (5) above, we do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent. Very truly yours, TROUTMAN SANDERS LLP
