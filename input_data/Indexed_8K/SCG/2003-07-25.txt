Exhibit 99 For Immediate Release Media Contact: Investor Contact: Cathy Love John Winn (803) 217-7777 (803) 217-9240 clove@scana.com jwinn@scana.com SCANA Reports Financial Results for Second Quarter 2003 Columbia, SC, July 25, 2003...SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) announced today that reported earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2003 were $74 million, or 67 cents per share. These results include a net after-tax gain of $32 million, or 29 cents per share, related to the continued monetization and valuation of the Company's telecommunications assets. By comparison, reported earnings for the second quarter of 2002 were $40 million, or 38 cents per share. Those prior period results included a net after-tax gain of $2 million, or 2 cents per share, related to the monetization and valuation of telecommunications assets. Excluding from reported earnings the effects of the monetization and valuation of telecommunications assets, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations for the second quarter of 2003 were $42 million, or 38 cents per share, compared to $38 million, or 36 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2002. Reported earnings (loss) are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). SCANA's management believes that, in addition to reported earnings (loss) under GAAP, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and improves comparability of period-over-period financial performance. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings (loss) per share to GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations per share for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 is provided in the following table: "We are pleased with our second quarter financial performance, especially given the unfavorable impact that milder weather had on our electric margins," said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "Average temperatures across our electric service territory during the second quarter, as measured by cooling degree days, were 16 percent cooler than the second quarter of last year and 10 percent cooler than normal. The milder weather reduced second quarter earnings by 4 cents per share compared to the second quarter of last year." SCANA's reported earnings for the first six months of 2003 were $158 million, or $1.42 per share, compared to a reported loss of $262 million, or $2.50 per share, for the same period in 2002. GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations, which exclude from reported earnings the cumulative effects of mandated changes in accounting principles and the effects of sales and impairment charges related to telecommunications investments, were $126 million, or $1.13 per share, for the first six months of 2003 compared to $115 million, or $1.10 per share, for the same period last year. "Through the first six months of this year, net earnings from operations are 3 cents per share ahead of results at the same time last year," said Marsh. "As we begin the second half of the year, our commitment is to execute our strategic plan to achieve the financial, operational and customer service goals we set for the year by continuing to focus on the fundamentals that have made us successful." REGULATED OPERATIONS South Carolina Electric & Gas Company Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2003 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, were $40 million, or 36 cents per share, compared to $39 million, or 37 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. The favorable impact of the retail electric rate increase that was effective in February 2003 was offset by related increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation expense, interest expense and property taxes, and by milder weather. The milder weather, combined with a lackluster economy, resulted in a 1.6 percent decline in total kilowatt-hour sales of electricity in the second quarter of 2003 compared to the same quarter last year. Residential sales increased 1.5 percent, commercial sales were down less than 1 percent and industrial sales declined 2.9 percent. "The slight increase in residential electricity sales for the quarter is attributable to the solid customer growth we have experienced over the past 12 months," said Marsh. At June 30, 2003, SCE&G was serving approximately 563,000 electric customers, an increase of about 2.0 percent over the past year. PSNC Energy PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, had a seasonal reported loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003, unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2002. Higher sales margins, driven by good customer growth and cooler weather early in the quarter, were offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses. At June 30, 2003, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 377,000 customers, an increase of 2.8 percent over the last twelve months. South Carolina Pipeline Corporation South Carolina Pipeline, SCANA's gas transmission subsidiary, had reported earnings of $1 million, or 1 cent per share, in the second quarter of 2003, down from $3 million, or 3 cents per share in the same quarter last year. That decline primarily reflects the negative impact on sales margins of high wholesale natural gas prices, which resulted in intense competition with alternative fuels in industrial interruptible markets. Pipeline's earnings were also negatively affected by reduced demand for natural gas for electric generation as a result of milder weather.
NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS SCANA Energy - Georgia SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, had reported earnings of $3 million, or 3 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003, compared to breakeven results in the same quarter last year. More favorable market conditions resulted in higher sales margins, which more than offset higher operating and customer service expenses. At June 30, 2003, SCANA Energy was serving approximately 386,000 customers, maintaining its position as the second largest natural gas marketer in Georgia with about a 25 percent market share. Corporate and Other Non-Regulated SCANA's other non-regulated businesses had combined reported earnings of $31 million, or 29 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003. That compares to breakeven results in the second quarter of 2002. Excluding from reported earnings the effects of the monetization and valuation of telecommunications assets in both quarters, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations were breakeven in the second quarter of 2003, compared to a GAAP-adjusted net loss from operations in the second quarter of 2002 of $2 million, or 2 cents per share. That improvement was due primarily to lower interest expense. On May 9, 2003, West Corporation (Nasdaq: WSTC), a communications company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, completed the acquisition of InterCall from ITC Holding Company, a communications company headquartered in West Point, Georgia, in a $400 million cash transaction. InterCall, based in Chicago, is a provider of audio, web and video conferencing solutions. Based on its proportionate equity ownership in ITC Holding Company, SCANA Communications Holdings, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of SCANA Corporation, recorded an after-tax gain of $37 million, or 33 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003. The cash proceeds have been applied to debt reduction at SCANA. In the second quarter of 2003, SCANA Communications Holdings, Inc. also recorded an impairment charge on its investment in Knology, Inc. of $5 million, or 4 cents per share. Headquartered in West Point, Georgia, Knology is a leading provider of interactive voice, video and data services, including cable TV, in the Southeast. 2003 OUTLOOK The Company reaffirms its previous guidance that GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations in 2003 will be in the range of $2.50 - $2.60 per share. The Company's long-term goal is to achieve a 6 - 8% average annual growth in GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations per share over the next 3-5 years. Taking into consideration the effects of the monetization and valuation of telecommunications investments during the first half of 2003, the Company anticipates that reported (GAAP) earnings in 2003 will be 29 cents per share higher than the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations. The 2003 guidance assumes normal weather in the Company's electric and natural gas service areas for the remainder of the year and excludes any potential gains or losses from investing activities or sales of certain assets. PROFILE SCANA Corporation, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Columbia, SC, is an energy-based holding company principally engaged, through subsidiaries, in electric and natural gas utility operations, telecommunications and other energy-related businesses.
