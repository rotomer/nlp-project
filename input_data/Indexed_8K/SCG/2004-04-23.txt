Exhibit 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DATED APRIL 23, 2004 For Immediate Release Media Contact: Investor Contact: Cathy Love John Winn (803) 217-7777 (803) 217-9240 clove@scana.com jwinn@scana.com SCANA Reports Financial Results for First Quarter 2004 Columbia, SC, April 23, 2004...SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) reported earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2004 of $101 million, or 91 cents per share, compared to $84 million, or 75 cents per share, for the same period in 2003. SCANA's reported earnings are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). "We are pleased with our first quarter financial performance," said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "As we look ahead to the remainder of 2004, we will maintain our focus on the fundamentals that have made us successful by executing our business plans to meet our operational and customer service goals for the year." Marsh noted that SCANA's strong first quarter results were attributable primarily to higher sales of electricity and natural gas, which more than offset increased operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation expense, property taxes, and the cost of system restoration following January's ice storm. "The increase in the electric margin was attributable to several factors, including colder weather of 2 cents per share, customer growth of 2 cents per share, and higher off-system sales of 8 cents per share," said Marsh. "Strong sales of natural gas in our retail markets was the principal factor contributing to the higher natural gas margin." The weather across the Company's electric service area during the quarter, as measured by heating degree days, was 6 percent colder than last year and 13 percent colder than normal. This weather, combined with solid customer growth, resulted in an increase in retail kilowatt-hour sales of electricity in the first quarter of 2004 of 5.1 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Residential sales were up 7.3 percent, commercial sales were up 4.9 percent and industrial sales rose 3.0 percent. Wholesale, or off-system, sales were up 76 percent. That increase includes off-system sales under long-term contracts that began in January 2004. Total sales of electricity were up 12 percent compared to the first quarter of 2003. Total consolidated dekatherm sales of natural gas in the first quarter of 2004 were up 3.5 percent compared to the same period last year. Residential and commercial sales were up 3.5 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, and industrial sales rose 1.4 percent. Retail sales were up 2.7 percent. At March 31, 2004, the Company was serving approximately 1.2 million natural gas customers in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. That represents a 10.0 percent increase over the past year, driven primarily by customer growth in Georgia.
REGULATED OPERATIONS: South Carolina Electric & Gas Company South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, reported earnings in the first quarter of 2004 of $55 million, or 49 cents per share, compared to $47 million, or 42 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. That increase was due mainly to the impact of higher electricity sales, which offset higher expenses. At March 31, 2004, SCE&G was serving approximately 574,000 electric customers and 279,000 natural gas customers, representing increases of 2.2 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, over the past year. Construction of SCE&G's $450 million Jasper Plant has been completed and the plant is currently undergoing final testing. The 875-megawatt natural gas-fired electric generating facility is scheduled to enter commercial operation on May 1, 2004. Construction of the $275 million back-up dam at Lake Murray near Columbia, SC continues on schedule for completion in 2005. PSNC Energy PSNC Energy, SCANA's retail natural gas subsidiary headquartered in Gastonia, North Carolina, reported earnings of $23 million, or 20 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2004, compared to $24 million, or 21 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2003. Higher operating and maintenance expenses offset a small increase in the natural gas sales margin reflecting higher industrial usage and customer growth. At March 31, 2004 PSNC Energy was serving approximately 398,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 3.2 percent over the past twelve months. South Carolina Pipeline Corporation South Carolina Pipeline Corporation, SCANA's intrastate natural gas transmission subsidiary, reported earnings in the first quarter of $3 million, or 3 cents per share, unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2003. Margins from higher transportation revenues were offset by lower margins on competitive sales of natural gas to industrial interruptible customers. In March 2004, South Carolina Pipeline completed phase one of its South System Loop project, on schedule and under budget. This 38-mile natural gas transmission pipeline will link Pipeline's existing system with the new SCG natural gas pipeline that serves SCE&G's Jasper Plant, bringing a new source of natural gas to support future growth in the southern part of South Carolina. NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS: SCANA Energy - Georgia SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas business in Georgia, reported earnings of $21 million, or 19 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2004, compared to $13 million, or 12 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2003. That improvement was due primarily to higher sales margins resulting from customer growth and more favorable market conditions, which offset higher operating and customer service expenses. On March 1, 2004, SCANA Energy successfully closed its previously announced acquisition of Energy America's natural gas customers in Georgia. With the addition of these 47,000 customers, SCANA Energy is currently serving more than 470,000 customers in Georgia, maintaining its position as the state's second largest marketer with about a 30 percent market share. Financially, this transaction is expected to be earnings neutral in 2004 and accretive thereafter. Also during the first quarter, the Georgia Public Service Commission extended SCANA Energy's two-year term as the state's regulated natural gas provider to low income and credit challenged customers by one year, to August 2005. Corporate and Other SCANA's other businesses collectively reported breakeven results in the first quarter of 2004, compared to a reported loss of $3 million, or 3 cents per share in the same quarter of 2003. Lower interest expense contributed to that improvement. 2004 Outlook The Company reaffirms its previous guidance that GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations in 2004 are expected to be in the range of $2.55 - $2.75 per share. The 2004 guidance assumes normal weather in the Company's electric and natural gas service areas and excludes any potential gains or losses from investing activities or sales of certain assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings include changes in interest rates, the performance of the Company's pension plan assets, wholesale natural gas prices and other factors discussed in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The Company's long-term goal is to achieve average annual earnings growth of 4-6 percent over the next 3-5 years. Profile SCANA Corporation, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Columbia, SC, is an energy-based holding company principally engaged, through subsidiaries, in electric and natural gas utility operations, telecommunications and other energy-related businesses.
