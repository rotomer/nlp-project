The press release discloses a non-GAAP measure, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations, which excludes from net income the effects of sales of certain investments and impairment charges related to certain investments.

EXHIBIT INDEX Number 99.1 Press release dated July 23, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DATED JULY 23, 2004 For Immediate Release Media Contact: Investor Contact: Cathy Love John Winn (803) 217-7777 (803) 217-9240 clove@scana.com jwinn@scana.com SCANA Reports Financial Results for Second Quarter 2004 Columbia, SC, July 23, 2004...SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) reported earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2004 of $60 million, or 54 cents per share, compared to $74 million, or 67 cents per share for the second quarter of 2003. Excluding from the 2003 results a net after-tax gain of $32 million, or 29 cents per share (related to the monetization and valuation of the Company's telecommunications assets), GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations for the second quarter of 2003 were $42 million, or 38 cents per share. SCANA's reported earnings are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). SCANA's management believes that, in addition to reported earnings under GAAP, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and can aid in analysis of period-over-period financial performance. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings per share to GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 is provided in the following table: "The improvement in second quarter GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations was due largely to higher sales of electricity driven by weather that was significantly warmer than normal," said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "By comparison, temperatures in the second quarter of 2003 averaged well below normal. The more favorable weather contributed 10 cents per share to our electric margin for the quarter, while higher off-system sales of electricity and customer growth contributed 5 cents per share and 4 cents per share, respectively. These positive factors offset increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes." Marsh noted that the Company's second quarter results included expenses associated with the Company's new 875 megawatt Jasper Electric Generating Station, which began commercial operation on May 1, 2004. For the two months the Jasper Station was in operation, it increased operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense by about 2 cents per share, net of income taxes. The weather across the Company's electric service area during the second quarter, as measured by cooling degree days, was 30 percent warmer than the same quarter last year and about 18 percent warmer than normal. The warmer temperatures, combined with a 2.4 percent increase in customers, resulted in an 8.4 percent increase in retail kilowatt-hour sales of electricity compared to the same quarter in 2003. Residential sales were up 14 percent, commercial sales increased 7.1 percent, and sales to industrial customers rose 4.0 percent. Wholesale, or off-system sales, were up 65 percent, principally reflecting sales under long-term contracts that began in January 2004. Total kilowatt-hour sales of electricity in the second quarter were up about 13 percent compared to the second quarter of 2003. Reported earnings for the first six months of 2004 were $161 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to $158 million, or $1.42 per share, for the same period in 2003. Excluding from 2003 results the net after-tax gain of $32 million, or 29 cents per share (related to the monetization and valuation of telecommunications assets), GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations for the first six months of 2003 were $126 million, or $1.13 per share. "Given our performance through the first six months of 2004, we remain comfortable with our full-year earnings guidance of $2.55 to $2.75 per share," said Marsh. "Financial results for the second half of the year will be impacted by the weather, economic conditions, and the additional expenses associated with the Jasper Station. Marsh added that South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, filed an application with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on July 1, 2004, requesting a 5.66 percent, or $81 million increase in retail electric base rates (based on an adjusted test year of March 31, 2004). That increase is largely associated with recovering construction and operating costs associated with the Jasper Station as well as costs related to mandatory environmental upgrades at the company's generating facilities. If approved, the new rates would go into effect in January 2005. In its application, SCE&G also requested Commission approval of an accounting plan that would apply current and anticipated synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back-up dam at Lake Murray near Columbia, South Carolina. This $275 million project, which was mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to help ensure the safety of the dam in the event of a major earthquake, is on budget and is scheduled for completion in 2005. REGULATED OPERATIONS South Carolina Electric & Gas Company Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2004 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company were $56 million, or 50 cents per share, compared to $40 million, or 36 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003. The improvement was due primarily to the higher electric margin, which more than offset increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation expense, and property taxes. At June 30, 2004, SCE&G was serving approximately 577,000 electric customers and 276,000 natural gas customers, up 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, over the past year. PSNC Energy PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported a seasonal loss of $4 million, or 3 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2004, compared to a loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2003. That decline was mainly attributable to lower sales margins, due primarily to warmer weather. At June 30, 2004, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 388,000 customers, an increase of 3.1 percent over the last twelve months.
South Carolina Pipeline Corporation South Carolina Pipeline, SCANA's intrastate natural gas transmission subsidiary, reported earnings of $3 million, or 3 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2004, up from $1 million, or 1 cent per share in the same quarter last year. That improvement was due primarily to higher margins from increased transportation volumes. NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS SCANA Energy - Georgia SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported earnings of $3 million, or 3 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2004, unchanged compared to results in the second quarter of 2003. Higher sales margins resulting from customer growth and favorable market conditions were offset by higher operating and customer service expenses. The number of customers served by SCANA Energy, including the 47,000 customers acquired from Energy America in March 2004, increased 19 percent over the past year to approximately 460,000 at June 30, 2004, strengthening the company's position as the second largest natural gas marketer in Georgia with about a 30 percent market share. Corporate and Other SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported combined earnings of $2 million, or 1 cent per share, in the second quarter of 2004, compared to breakeven results in the same quarter last year. Lower interest expense contributed to that improvement. 2004 EARNINGS OUTLOOK The Company reaffirms its previous guidance that earnings per share in 2004 are expected to be in the range of $2.55 - $2.75 per share. The 2004 guidance assumes normal weather in the Company's electric and natural gas service areas during the second half of the year and excludes any potential gains or losses from investing activities or sales of certain assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings include changes in interest rates, the performance of the Company's pension plan assets, wholesale natural gas prices and other factors discussed in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The Company's long-term goal is to achieve average annual growth in earnings per share of 4-6 percent over the next 3-5 years. PROFILE SCANA Corporation, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, is an energy-based holding company principally engaged, through subsidiaries, in electric and natural gas utility operations, telecommunications and other energy-related businesses. The Company serves approximately 577,000 electric customers in South Carolina and more than one million natural gas customers in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia.
