South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), principal subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG), announced today that it has entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement with the Staff of the South Carolina Public Service Commission in connection with SCE&G's pending retail electric rate increase application that was filed on July 1, 2004. The settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the South Carolina Public Service Commission following a public hearing that begins on November 1, 2004. The settlement agreement covers all of the major issues addressed in SCE&G's application and, if approved, would result in an overall increase in retail electric revenues of approximately $51.1 million (3.57%) based on an adjusted test year ended March 31, 2004, or about 63% of the $81.2 million (5.66%) overall revenue increase requested by the company in its application. The settlement agreement establishes an allowed return on common equity in a range of 11.4% to 10.4%, with rates to be set based on the midpoint of that range (10.9%). "We are pleased to have reached agreement with a key party to this proceeding and are seeking a similar agreement with other intervenors," said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "This agreement balances the needs of SCE&G's customers and SCANA's shareholders, and we believe it is consistent with the spirit of prior Commission rulings." In summary, highlights of the stipulation and settlement agreement are as follows: (1) Produces an increase in annual retail electric revenues of approximately $51.1 million (3.57%), or about 63% of the $81.2 million (5.66%) increase requested by SCE&G (2) Updates SCE&G's capital structure to August 31, 2004 (see Table 1) (3) Sets an allowed return on common equity in a range of 11.4% to 10.4%, with rates being set based on the midpoint of that range (10.9%) (4) Reaffirms the siting and sizing of, and approves updated capital costs, operation and maintenance expenses and depreciation expenses requested by SCE&G related to, the 875 MW Jasper Electric Generating Plant, which began commercial operation on May 1, 2004 (5) Affirms that revenue related to the 250 MW and 100 MW contracts for sale of capacity and energy from system resources to the North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation have been properly accounted for as opportunity sales (6) Approves SCE&G's proposal to use current and anticipated synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the capital cost of the Lake Murray Dam remediation project (7) Allows SCE&G to recover costs associated with the GridSouth Regional Transmission Organization project that was cancelled in 2002 (8) Approves for rate-making and accounting purposes the revised depreciation rates proposed by SCE&G based on a recently completed depreciation study (9) Approves SCE&G's request to extend by 5 years (until December 31, 2010) the accelerated capital recovery mechanism for its Cope Generating Station The South Carolina Public Service Commission has scheduled a public hearing on SCE&G's rate increase request to begin on November 1, 2004, and is expected to issue an order in this case prior to year end. In its application, SCE&G requested that the approved rates be effective on January 1, 2005.
