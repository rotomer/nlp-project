Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On February 11, 2005, SCANA Corporation (the Company) issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. This press release corrects an inadvertent typographical error in the press release issued earlier today and previously filed on Form 8-K. In the second paragraph under the heading "Corporate and Other", the first line now begins "For the fourth quarter of 2004" instead of "For the fourth quarter of 2003". The press release discloses a non-GAAP measure, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations, which excludes from net income the effects of sales of, and impairment charges related to, certain investments and the effects of a charge related to pending litigation. The Company's management believes that GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In management's opinion, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Company's primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for management's provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non-GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it.

EXHIBIT INDEX Number 99.1 Press release dated February 11, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DATED FEBRUARY 11, 2005 For Immediate Release Media Contact: Investor Contact: Eric Boomhower John Winn (803) 217-7701 (803) 217-9240 eboomhower@scana.com jwinn@scana.com SCANA Reports Results for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2004, Announces 2005 Earnings Guidance Columbia, SC, February 11, 2005...SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2004 and announced earnings guidance for 2005. FULL YEAR RESULTS For the year ended December 31, 2004, SCANA's reported earnings were $257 million, or $2.30 per share, compared to $282 million, or $2.54 per share, for 2003. Excluding certain items listed in the table below, SCANA's GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations for 2004 were $298 million, or $2.67 per share, compared to $278 million, or $2.50 per share, in 2003. SCANA's reported earnings are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). SCANA's management believes that, in addition to reported earnings under GAAP, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In management's opinion, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Company's primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for management's provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non-GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings per share to GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations per share for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is provided in the following table: "We are pleased with the financial results we achieved in 2004," said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "The Company's 2004 GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations of $2.67 per share were up 6.8 percent from $2.50 per share in 2003 and in-line with our expectations." The improvement in SCANA's 2004 GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations per share was attributable to higher margins on sales of electricity and natural gas, which more than offset increases in operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes. The higher electric margin was primarily attributable to an increase in kilowatt-hour sales of electricity driven by off-system sales, more favorable weather and solid customer growth. The higher natural gas margin was primarily attributable to improved results in SCANA's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia. Total kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales of electricity in 2004 were up about 11 percent compared to 2003. Residential sales were up 6.6 percent, commercial sales increased 4.4 percent and industrial sales were up about 3.5 percent. Wholesale, or off-system, sales were up nearly 81 percent, principally reflecting sales under long-term contracts that began in January 2004. The Company's electric customer base totaled approximately 585,000 at December 31, 2004, a 2.5 percent increase compared to year-end 2003. Total dekatherm sales of natural gas in 2004 were up about 15 percent compared to 2003. Residential and commercial sales were each up 1.4 percent while industrial sales rose 11 percent. Transportation volumes were up about 77 percent, reflecting increased throughput at the Company's two transmission pipeline companies. The number of natural gas customers in the Company's three-state service area increased 7.1 percent to approximately 1.2 million at year-end 2004. That growth reflected the acquisition of 47,000 new customers from Energy America in Georgia in the first quarter of 2004. "Financially, we continued to grow our businesses profitably, improve our overall financial position and to increase our annual common dividend in 2004," said Marsh. "These factors contributed to a solid total return to our shareholders." With the sale of its ITC^DeltaCom and Knology investments late in the year, the Company has monetized substantially all of its remaining telecommunications investments. "After-tax cash proceeds from these sales and related tax benefits totaling approximately $121 million will be used to repay outstanding debt, improving the Company's overall financial strength," said Marsh. Marsh noted that SCANA also achieved a number of significant operational milestones in 2004. "Our generation facilities performed safely and efficiently and we continued to provide nationally-recognized service to our customers. With completion of the 875-megawatt Jasper Generating Station, which began commercial operation on May 1, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval in April of a 20-year license extension for the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station, we have helped ensure the availability of reliable, economically-priced power for our customers for many years to come. We also completed pipeline expansion projects in South Carolina and North Carolina that will bring additional supplies of natural gas to support future growth in both states. As a result of the outstanding efforts of our employees, we were able to respond in a timely manner to power outages following a major ice storm in January of 2004 and an unprecedented four hurricanes and one tropical storm during the summer hurricane season. Substantially all of the costs associated with power restoration following these storms was covered by our storm damage reserve mechanism." In December 2004, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved a $41.4 million, or 2.89 percent, increase in the Company's retail electric base rates, effective on January 6, 2005. That order included full recovery of the capital and operating costs related to the Jasper Plant and authorized a return on common equity of 10.7 percent within an approved range of 10.4 percent to 11.4 percent. "In 2005, we will continue to focus our efforts on those activities that have made us successful, including providing safe, reliable supplies of electricity and natural gas, outstanding customer service and increased value for our shareholders," said Marsh. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS For the fourth quarter of 2004, SCANA's reported earnings were $42 million, or $.37 per share, compared to $40 million, or $.36 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2003. GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $57 million, or $.51 per share, compared to $70 million, or $.63 per share, in 2003. "The $.12 per share decrease in GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations was primarily attributable to increases in operation and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense, including costs associated with operations at our new Jasper Plant," said Marsh. "The higher expenses more than offset improved margins on sales of electricity and natural gas." Despite milder weather, retail sales of electricity were up 2.4 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Residential sales were up 1.9 percent while commercial and industrial sales each rose 2.7 percent. Driven by the long-term, off-system contract sales that began in January 2004, total sales of electricity for the quarter were up 9.8 percent. Retail dekatherm sales of natural gas to ultimate consumers in the fourth quarter of 2004 were relatively unchanged compared to the same quarter last year. Lower residential and commercial sales principally reflecting the milder weather offset higher industrial sales. As a result of improved sales for resale and transportation volumes, total dekatherm sales of natural gas in the fourth quarter of 2004 were up about 12 percent compared to the same quarter in 2003. RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCANA's principal subsidiary reported 2004 earnings of $235 million, or $2.11 per share, compared to $221 million, or $1.99 per share, in 2003. The improvement was due primarily to the higher electric margin, which more than offset higher expenses. For the fourth quarter of 2004, SCE&G reported earnings of $40 million, or $.36 per share, compared to $46 million, or $.42 per share in the same quarter of 2003. Higher expenses and a lower margin on natural gas sales more than offset an improved electric margin. PSNC Energy SCANA's North Carolina-based natural gas distribution business reported earnings in 2004 of $24 million, or $.21 per share, compared to $31 million, or $.28 per share, in 2003. Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $11 million, or $.10 per share, compared to $15 million, or $.14 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. The earnings decline in both periods was primarily attributable to increased expenses and a lower natural gas sales margin reflecting milder weather. South Carolina Pipeline Corporation The Company's intrastate natural gas transmission business reported earnings in 2004 of $10 million, or $.09 per share, compared to $7 million, or $.06 per share in 2003. That improvement was due primarily to higher margins from increased transportation volumes. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $2 million, or $.02 per share, unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. SCANA Energy - Georgia In 2004, SCANA's retail natural gas business in Georgia reported earnings of $29 million, or $.26 per share, compared to $20 million, or $.18 per share, in 2003. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $6 million, or $.05 per share, compared to $3 million, or $.03 per share in 2003. The earnings improvement in both periods was driven by a higher sales margin reflecting more favorable market conditions and customer growth for the year of nearly 14 percent. Corporate and Other SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Primesouth, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing, SCG Pipeline, SCANA Services and the holding company, recorded a combined loss of $41 million, or $.37 per share, in 2004 compared to earnings of $3 million, or $.03 per share, in 2003. Excluding from reported earnings the impact of the monetization and valuation of the Company's telecommunications investments in both periods and the charge in 2004 related to pending litigation associated with the sale of the Company's propane assets in 1999, these companies recorded breakeven results in 2004 compared to a GAAP-adjusted net loss from operations of $1 million, or $.01 per share, in 2003.
For the fourth quarter of 2004, these businesses reported a loss of $18 million, or $.16 per share, compared to a reported loss of $27 million, or $.25 per share, in the same quarter in 2003. Excluding from reported earnings the impact of the monetization and valuation of the Company's telecommunications investments in both periods, this group recorded a GAAP-adjusted net loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 of $3 million, or $.02 per share, compared to earnings of $3 million, or $.02 per share, in 2003. That $.04 per share decline reflected less favorable results in the Company's energy marketing business and higher expenses at the holding company. EXPLANATION OF ITEMS INCLUDED IN REPORTED (GAAP) EARNINGS BUT EXCLUDED FROM GAAP-ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS In the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an after-tax, non-cash impairment of approximately $15 million, or 13 cents per share, related to the valuation of its investment in Knology, a regional telecommunications provider headquartered in West Point, Georgia, and an after-tax charge of $11 million, or 10 cents per share, related to pending litigation associated with the sale of the Company's propane assets in 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $9 million, or $.08 cents per share, on the sale of its investment in Knology, and a loss of approximately $6 million, or $.06 cents per share, from the sale of its investment in ITC^DeltaCom, a provider of telecommunications services in the Southeast. During 2003, the Company recorded after-tax, non-cash impairments totaling $35 million, or $.31 per share, on its investment in Knology, and an after-tax gain of $39 million, or $.35 per share, from the sale of the Company's investment in ITC Holding Company. 2005 EARNINGS OUTLOOK For 2005, the Company estimates that earnings will be in the range of $2.65 - $2.85 per share. This guidance assumes normal weather in the Company's electric and natural gas service areas and excludes any potential gains or losses from litigation or sales of certain assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The Company's goal is to achieve average annual earnings growth of 4-6 percent over the next 3-5 years.
