Item 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On February 17, 2005, the Board of Directors of SCANA Corporation (the Company) authorized the amendment of the Company's Short-Term Annual Incentive Plan (the Plan). The Plan is an annual incentive compensation plan under which compensation is linked to achievement of certain performance goals which include Company earnings per share, business unit and/or individual goals, and discretionary performance goals. Specific business unit and individual goal criteria may vary among business units and eligible participants. The goals for eligible participants are coordinated through the participants' business units. The Board of Directors establishes the specific goal criteria for the Chief Executive Officer. Eligibility for the Plan is automatic for certain categories of employees and officers and discretionary for certain other categories Participants are selected annually and upon selection are assigned target bonuses equal to specified percentages of their annual base salaries. The Plan also provides for additional discretionary increases over the targeted percentage based on individual performance. Corporate performance goals for each business unit are reviewed annually by the Company's Board of Directors following a review of the annual performance over the prior year. After the Company's Board of Directors has determined that the Company's corporate performance goals for a given year have been met, each participant's bonus eligibility is determined, by the Company's Board of Directors in the case of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and by the participant's direct supervisor in the case of all other participants. The amendments to the Plan authorized by the Board of Directors (i) changed the basis for a participant's target bonus from the participant's salary "control point" to the participant's annual base salary, (ii) provided guidance as to eligibility for participation in the Plan and (iii) changed certain target bonus percentages. Each of the executive officers of the Company, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated participates in the Plan.
