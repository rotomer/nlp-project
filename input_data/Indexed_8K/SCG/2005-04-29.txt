EXHIBIT INDEX Number 99.1 Press release dated April 29, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DATED APRIL 29, 2005 For Immediate Release Media Contact: Investor Contact: Eric Boomhower John Winn (803) 217-7701 (803) 217-9240 eboomhower@scana.com jwinn@scana.com SCANA Reports Financial Results for First Quarter 2005 Columbia, SC, April 29, 2005...SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today reported consolidated earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2005 of $101 million, or 89 cents per share, compared to $101 million, or 91 cents per share, for the same period in 2004. SCANA's reported earnings are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). "From an operations perspective, higher margins on sales of electricity and natural gas in the first quarter of 2005 were offset by increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation and interest expense," said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "The higher expenses included costs associated with the 875 megawatt Jasper Electric Generating Station, which went into commercial operation in May of last year. Earnings per share was reduced 2 cents per share as a result of dilution from the issuance of common stock through the Company's stock plans. Proceeds from those sales are being applied to debt reduction." The electric sales margin in the first quarter increased 5 cents per share compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting the 2.89 percent retail electric rate increase that was effective on January 6, 2005, and customer growth. However, milder weather, which contributed to a decline in sales of electricity compared to the first quarter of last year, reduced comparative quarterly earnings by 3 cents per share and was also a factor in a decrease in off-system sales of electricity that reduced earnings by 1 cent per share. The weather across the Company's electric service area during the quarter, as measured by heating degree days, was 12 percent milder than in the same quarter of 2004. That contributed to a 1.2 percent decrease in retail kilowatt-hour sales of electricity. Residential sales were down 2.0 percent, commercial sales were flat and industrial sales were down 1.4 percent. Wholesale, or off-system, sales were down 8.5 percent, also due in part to milder weather. The natural gas sales margin in the first quarter was up 6 cents per share compared to the first quarter of 2004. "While margins in our regulated natural gas businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina were up slightly due mainly to customer growth, most of that total margin increase reflected more favorable market conditions and customer growth in our natural gas marketing business in Georgia," said Marsh. Dekatherm sales of natural gas to ultimate (retail) consumers in the first quarter of 2004 were relatively unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2004. Declines in residential and commercial sales of 3.2 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, principally reflecting the milder weather, were offset by an increase in industrial sales of 7.0 percent. As a result of higher sales for resale and transportation volumes, total dekatherm sales of natural gas in the first quarter of 2005 were up 8.3 percent. At March 31, 2005, the Company was serving approximately 1.2 million natural gas customers in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia, up 2.8 percent from the same time last year. "Our first quarter results represent a solid start to the year and keep us on track to reach our 2005 targeted earnings of $2.65 - $2.85 per share," said Marsh. "We will continue to focus our efforts on achieving the highest operating and customer service standards while providing a competitive total return to our shareholders."
RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS South Carolina Electric & Gas Company South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, reported earnings in the first quarter of 2005 of $52 million, or 46 cents per share, down from $54 million, or 49 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. That decline was due mainly to lower sales of electricity due to milder weather, and to higher expenses. At March 31, 2005, SCE&G was serving approximately 590,000 electric customers and 286,000 natural gas customers, representing increases of 2.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, from the same date last year. Construction of the back-up dam at Lake Murray, which was required to comply with new earthquake safety standards mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is nearing completion. The $275 million (excluding allowance for funds used during construction) project is on budget and scheduled for completion this spring. PSNC Energy PSNC Energy, SCANA's retail natural gas subsidiary headquartered in Gastonia, North Carolina, reported earnings of $24 million, or 21 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $23 million, or 20 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2004. The improvement was due primarily to a higher sales margin driven by customer growth. At March 31, 2005, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 414,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 4.1 percent from the same date last year. South Carolina Pipeline Corporation South Carolina Pipeline Corporation, SCANA's intrastate natural gas transmission subsidiary, reported earnings in the first quarter of 2005 of $4 million, or 3 cents per share, compared to earnings of $3 million, or 3 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2004. Improved margins from higher transportation volumes were largely offset by increased expenses. SCANA Energy - Georgia SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported earnings of $22 million, or 20 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $21 million, or 19 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2004. An improved sales margin resulting from customer growth and favorable market conditions more than offset higher operating and customer service expenses. At March 31, 2005, SCANA Energy was serving more than 470,000 customers, maintaining its position as the number two marketer in Georgia. Corporate and Other SCANA's other businesses, which include Primesouth, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing, SCG Pipeline, SCANA Services and the holding company, collectively recorded a loss of $1 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to breakeven results in the first quarter of 2004. Higher interest expense caused by an increase in interest rates on short-term debt contributed to that decline. RETAIL NATURAL GAS RATE FILING IN SOUTH CAROLINA On April 26, 2005, SCE&G filed an application with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina requesting a 7.09 percent increase in retail natural gas base rates. If approved, the new rates would produce approximately $28 million in additional annual revenues based on an adjusted test year ended December 31, 2004. SCE&G's last natural gas base rate increase was in 1989. If approved, the new rates would go into effect in November 2005. 2005 OUTLOOK The Company reaffirms its previous guidance that 2005 earnings are expected to be in the range of $2.65 - $2.85 per share. The 2005 guidance assumes normal weather in the Company's electric and natural gas service areas over the rest of the year. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The Company's goal is to achieve average annual earnings growth of 4-6 percent over the next 3-5 years.

Avg. Common Shares Outstanding 112.9 110.9 Basic and Diluted Reported Earnings Per Share $.89 $.91 Note (1): In January 2005, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an accounting method which allows the Company to recover the cost of the Lake Murray back-up dam project through the application of net synthetic fuel tax credits generated from its synthetic fuel partnerships. Under this methodology, beginning January 1, 2005, the Company recognized its accumulated synthetic fuel tax credits to offset an equal amount of accelerated depreciation on the dam project, net of partnership losses and income tax benefits. Recognition of accelerated depreciation related to the back-up dam costs will continue quarterly to the extent net synthetic fuel tax credits are earned, which is anticipated to be through 2007. While these entries resulted in a reduction in operating income for the 3 months ended March 31, 2005, there was no impact on net income as shown in the Income Statement Impact table below.
