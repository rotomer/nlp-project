Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On October 28, 2005, SCANA Corporation (the Company) issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The press release discloses a non-GAAP measure, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations, which in 2005 excludes from net income the effect of sales of certain investments and in 2004 excludes the effect of an impairment charge and a change related to pending litigation. The Companys management believes that GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Companys fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In managements opinion, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Companys primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for managements provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non-GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it.

Columbia, SC, October 28, 2005...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and reaffirmed its previous guidance for 2005 full-year earnings.
Reported (GAAP) earnings for the third quarter of 2005 were $100 million, or 88 cents per share. For the same quarter in 2004, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations were $80 million, or 71 cents per share. The prior period GAAP- adjusted results exclude an after-tax impairment charge of approximately $15 million, or 13 cents per share, related to the Companys telecommunications investments and an after-tax charge of $11 million, or 10 cents per share, related to litigation associated with the sale of the Companys propane assets in 1999. Including those prior period items, reported (GAAP) earnings in the third quarter of 2004 were $54 million, or 48 cents per share.
The 17 cents per share improvement in third quarter results was due primarily to an improved electric margin driven by warmer weather, said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer. The electric margin was up 25 cents per share for the quarter, with more favorable weather accounting for 10 cents of that increase. The balance of that electric margin increase was attributable to continued customer growth, higher off-system sales and the 2.89 percent retail electric rate increase that went into effect in January of this year. These positive factors were partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expense and interest expense. Quarterly per share earnings were also reduced slightly by dilution reflecting the issuance of new shares of common stock through the Companys stock plans. Proceeds of those sales are being applied to debt reduction.
SCANAs GAAP
-adjusted net earnings from operations for the first nine months of 2005 were $242 million, or $2.13 per share, compared to $241 million, or $2.16 per share, for the same period in 2004. The 3 cents per share decline in comparative year-to-date GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations was due in part to the impact of milder weather on electric margins during the first half of 2005. Other factors which had a negative impact on GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations were increases in operating and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and interest expense, and dilution. The current period results exclude an after-tax gain of $4 million, or 3 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2005 related to the sale of telecommunications assets. The prior period results exclude
the previously mentioned
after-tax charges totaling $26 million, or 23 cents per share. Including these items in both periods, reported (GAAP) earnings for the first nine months of 2005 were $246 million, or $2.16 per share, compared to $215 million, or $1.93 per share, for the same period in 2004.
SCANAs reported earnings are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). SCANAs management believes that, in addition to reported earnings under
GAAP, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of
the Companys fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In managements opinion, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Companys primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for managements provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non-GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings per share to GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 is provided in the following table:
 
 
Temperatures across the Companys electric service area during the third quarter, as measured by cooling degree days, were 16 percent warmer than during the same quarter last year and 10 percent warmer than normal. As a result, retail kilowatt-hour sales of electricity in the second quarter were up 6.2 percent compared to the same quarter in 2004. Weather-sensitive residential sales increased 11.1 percent and commercial sales were up 7.5 percent. Sales to industrial customers declined about 1 percent for the quarter while wholesale, or off-system, sales were up 4.8 percent. Total kilowatt-hour sales of electricity in the third quarter were up 6.1 percent compared to the same quarter last year.
SCANAs consolidated natural gas sales margin in the third quarter of 2005 was unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2004. Consolidated dekatherm sales of natural gas to retail customers in the third quarter of 2005 were up 6.6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. Although residential sales were down 1.4 percent and commercial sales declined 11.7 percent, in part reflecting the warmer weather, sales to industrial customers rose 11.0 percent. Total consolidated dekatherm sales of natural gas, which include sales for resale and transportation volumes, were up 8.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. At September 30, 2005, the Company was serving approximately 1.2 million natural gas customers in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia, a 2.4 percent increase compared to the same time last year.
As we look ahead to the remainder of this year and to 2006, we will continue to execute our strategic plan, which is focused on providing high quality services to our customers and increasing value for our shareholders over the long term, said Marsh.
RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
 
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
Reported earnings in the third quarter of 2005 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G) were $106 million, or 93 cents per share, compared to $85 million, or 76 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2004. The improvement was due primarily to a higher margin on sales of electricity resulting from warmer weather, higher rates and customer growth. At September 30, 2005, SCE&G was serving approximately 597,000 electric customers and 283,000 natural gas customers, up 2.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, from the same time last year.
PSNC Energy
PSNC Energy, the Companys North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported a seasonal loss of $6 million, or 6 cents per share, for the third quarter of 2005, unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2004. At September 30, 2005, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 407,000 customers, an increase of 4.1 percent over the last twelve months.
South Carolina Pipeline Corporation
Reported earnings for the third quarter of 2005 at South Carolina Pipeline, SCANAs intrastate natural gas transmission subsidiary, were $2 million, or 2 cents per share, compared to $1 million, or 1 cent per share, in the same quarter last year. Increased margins on sales of natural gas to industrial interruptible customers accounted for that improvement.
SCANA Energy - Georgia
SCANA Energy, the Companys retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $3 million, or 3 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2005, compared to a loss of $1 million, or 1 cent per share, in the same quarter in 2004. The earnings decline was attributable to lower margins reflecting a significantly higher wholesale cost of gas compared to the same quarter last year. At September 30, 2005, SCANA Energy was serving nearly 460,000 customers, maintaining its position as the second largest natural gas marketer in Georgia with about a 30 percent market share.
Corporate and Other
SCANAs corporate and other businesses, which include Primesouth, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing, SCG Pipeline, SCANA Services and the holding company, had combined reported earnings of $2 million, or 2 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2005. For the same period in 2004, these companies had GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations of $1 million, or 1 cent per share. The prior-period results exclude the aforementioned impact of the
after-tax charges totaling $26 million, or 23 cents per share. Including those prior period items,
these companies had a combined reported (GAAP) loss of $25 million, or 22 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2004.
RETAIL NATURAL GAS RATE ORDER
On October 12, 2005, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (SCPSC) approved a $22.9 million, or 5.69 percent, increase in SCE&Gs retail natural gas base rates. The Commissions order was consistent with a settlement agreement reached in August among the company, the Office of Regulatory Staff and the other interveners in the case. This represents the first increase in SCE&Gs natural gas base rates since 1989.
This rate increase was largely associated with recovering costs related to expanding and operating SCE&Gs natural gas distribution system, expenditures that are necessary to ensure safe, reliable and efficient service. The rate increase, which is based on a 10.25 percent allowed return on common equity, will also allow the company to make additional capital expenditures that will be necessary to support future growth and economic development in its natural gas service area. The new rates will be effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005.
2005 EARNINGS OUTLOOK
The Company reaffirms that GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations in 2005 are expected to be within the previously announced range of $2.65 - $2.85 per share. Taking into consideration the 3 cents per share gain on the monetization of a telecommunications investment in the second quarter, the Company anticipates that reported (GAAP) earnings in 2005 will be 3 cents per share higher than the GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations. The 2005 guidance assumes normal weather in the Companys electric and natural gas service areas during the fourth quarter of the year. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in the Companys Securities and Exchange Commission filings and below under the Safe Harbor Statement. The Companys goal is to achieve average annual earnings growth of 4-6 percent over the next 3-5 years.

Note (1): In January 2005, the South Carolina Public Service Commission approved an accounting methodology
which allows the Company to recover the cost of the Lake Murray back-up dam project through the application of
net synthetic fuel tax credits generated from its synthetic fuel partnerships. Under this methodology, beginning
January 1, 2005, the Company recognized its accumulated synthetic fuel tax credits to offset an equal amount of
accelerated depreciation on the dam project, net of partnership losses and income tax benefits. Recognition of
accelerated depreciation related to the back-up dam costs will continue quarterly to the extent net synthetic fuel
tax credits are earned. While these entries resulted in a reduction in operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005, there was no impact on net income. However, the Company is allowed to record non-cash carrying costs on the unrecovered investment. The impact of these entries in the Income Statement and Balance Sheet is shown in the tables below:
