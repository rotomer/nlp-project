Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On February 10, 2006, SCANA Corporation (SCANA, and together with its subsidiaries, the Company) issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The press release discloses a non-GAAP measure, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations, which in 2005 and 2004 excludes from net income the effect of sales of certain investments and in 2004 excludes the effect of an impairment charge and a charge related to pending litigation. The Companys management believes that GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Companys fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In managements opinion, GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Companys primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for managements provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non-GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it.
Item 8.01
 
OTHER EVENTS
FERC COMPLIANCE MATTERS
In 2004 and early 2005, SCANA and certain of its affiliates, like other integrated utilities, were the subject of an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions (FERC) Office of Market Oversight and Investigations (OMOI) focusing, among other things, on the relationship between the Companys merchant and transmission functions. These relationships are among those addressed in FERC Order 2004, a primary purpose of which order is to ensure that affiliates of transmission providers have no marketplace advantage over non-affiliated market participants. In connection with that investigation, the Company was assessed no monetary damages or penalties; however, under terms of a Settlement and Consent Agreement entered into on April 1, 2005, and approved by FERC order dated April 27, 2005, SCANA agreed to the implementation of a compliance plan which includes periodic reports to OMOI.
On January 2, 2006, SCANA provided to the FERC a quarterly update on this compliance plan, which included an acknowledgment of the Companys discovery that it may have improperly utilized network transmission services, rather than point-to-point transmission services, for purchases and sales of electricity in violation of South Carolina Electric & Gas Companys open access transmission tariff and applicable orders under the Federal Power Act that prohibit the use of network transmission service in support of certain off-system sales. This acknowledgement was in part the result of the Company's preliminary review of a FERC order issued following its examination of another energy provider in September 2005. Upon further review of that order and a comprehensive analysis, the Company has now determined and notified the FERC that it did improperly utilize network transmission service in a large number of purchase and sale transactions.
In response to this discovery, the Company has notified the FERC and has ceased participation in such transactions, has instituted additional self-restrictive procedures as safeguards to ensure full compliance in this area in the future, has committed to certain modifications to its compliance plan, including increased levels of training and monitoring and is fully cooperating with OMOI to resolve this matter.
As of December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded a loss accrual in the amount of approximately $0.8 million based on its estimation of net revenues from these transactions that occurred after the date of the Settlement and Consent Agreement and that might be subject to disgorgement pursuant to FERC orders. However, there remains uncertainty as to what additional actions may be taken by the FERC. Potential actions could include further modifications to the compliance plan or other non-monetary remedies. In addition to the disgorgement of profits, such remedies could also include penalties of up to a maximum of $1 million per violation or per day since August 8, 2005, the effective date of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Company estimates that there were approximately 1,200 of these transactions since August 8, 2005, that, despite the immaterial profits from the transactions, could be deemed in violation of the FERC's rule on the use of network transmission service. In light of the Companys self-reporting and other cooperation in the investigation of this matter, the Company's belief that no market participants or customers of the Company were harmed or disadvantaged by the transactions, and the Companys institution of appropriate safeguards referred to above, the Company does not believe that such sanctions are warranted. Nonetheless, the Company cannot predict what, if any, actions the FERC will take with respect to this matter, and is unable to determine if the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on its operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Columbia, SC, February 10, 2006...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2005 and announced earnings guidance for 2006.
FULL YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS
For the year ended December 31, 2005, SCANAs reported earnings were $320 million, or $2.81 per share, compared to $257 million, or $2.30 per share, in 2004. Excluding certain items listed in the table below, SCANAs GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations for 2005 were $316 million, or $2.78 per share, compared to $298 million, or $2.67 per share, in 2004.
We are certainly pleased with our overall earnings improvement in 2005 and that these earnings from our electric and natural gas businesses were within the authorized returns set by the various regulatory authorities that oversee our operations, said Kevin Marsh, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
 
SCANAs reported earnings are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). SCANAs management believes that, in addition to reported earnings under GAAP, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Companys fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data.
In managements opinion, the GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Companys primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for managements provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non-GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it.
 
A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings per share to GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations per share for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is provided in the following table:
 
The financial results we achieved in 2005 reflect another year of dedicated performance by our employees, who continued to focus on cost control while providing our customers with safe, reliable sources of energy and great service, said Marsh. SCANAs 2005 GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations of $2.78 per share were up 4.1 percent from $2.67 per share in 2004 and in-line with our guidance for the year.
The improvement in SCANAs 2005 GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations per share was attributable to higher margins on sales of electricity and natural gas, which more than offset increases in operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and interest expense and dilution associated with the issuance of new shares of common stock through the Companys stock plans. Proceeds from the issuance of new common shares are being applied to debt reduction. The higher electric margin was attributable to customer growth, off-system sales and to a 2.89 percent retail electric rate increase that was effective in January 2005. That rate increase was largely associated with recovering the annual capital and operating costs of the 875-megawatt Jasper Generating Station, which began commercial operation in May 2004. The higher consolidated natural gas margin was primarily attributable to customer growth in the Companys regulated natural gas distribution businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina and to slightly improved margins in the Companys retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia.
Retail kilowatt-hour (kwh) sales of electricity in 2005 were up about 1 percent compared to 2004. Residential sales were up 2.3 percent and commercial sales increased 1.9 percent. Industrial sales were down 1.6 percent for the year. Total kwh sales, which include wholesale sales, were up 0.4 percent for the year. The Company was serving approximately 610,000 customers at December 31, 2005, a 3.1 percent increase compared to year-end 2004.
Retail dekatherm (dt) sales of natural gas in 2005 were also up about 1 percent compared to 2004. Residential and industrial sales were up 1.9 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, while commercial sales declined 2.8 percent. Total dt sales of natural gas, which include sales for resale and transportation volumes, were up 4.2 percent for the year. The number of natural gas customers in the Companys three-state service area increased 2.6 percent to approximately 1.2 million at year-end 2005.
FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS
For the fourth quarter of 2005, SCANAs reported earnings were $74 million, or $.65 per share, compared to $42 million, or $.37 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2004. GAAP-adjusted net earnings from operations for the fourth quarter of 2004, which exclude losses associated with the monetization and valuation of the companys telecommunications assets totaling $15 million, or $.14 per share, were $57 million, or $.51 per share.
The $.14 per share improvement in fourth quarter GAAP-adjusted net earnings per share from operations was primarily attributable to higher margins on sales of electricity and natural gas, which more than offset higher expenses, said Marsh. Increased sales of electricity driven by colder weather and customer growth, off-system sales and the higher retail electric rates contributed to the improved electric margin. The increase in the consolidated natural gas margin for the quarter was primarily attributable to customer growth and colder weather.
Retail kilowatt-hour sales of electricity in the fourth quarter of 2005 were up 3.7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Driven by weather that was 11 percent colder than the previous year and 5 percent colder than normal, sales to residential customers were up 10.2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Commercial sales rose 3.8 percent while industrial sales declined 2.8 percent. Total sales of electricity for the quarter were up 3.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
 
Retail dekatherm sales of natural gas in the fourth quarter of 2005 were up 2.4 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Sales to residential customers were up 9.4 percent, primarily reflecting the colder weather. Commercial sales rose 7.3 percent while industrial sales were down 5.1 percent. As a result of decreased sales for resale and transportation volumes, total dekatherm sales of natural gas in the fourth quarter of 2005 were relatively unchanged compared to the same quarter in 2004.
In October 2005, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved a $22.9 million, or 5.69 percent, increase in retail natural gas base rates for South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005. This rate increase, which contributed about $.02 per share to fourth quarter earnings, was the first increase in SCE&Gs natural gas base rates since 1989, said Marsh. The new rates allowed us to begin recovering capital and operating costs associated with expanding and operating SCE&Gs natural gas system over the last 16 years. The Commissions order authorized a return on common equity of 10.25 percent, which will provide us the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on our gas assets and support the additional capital investments necessary to meet future growth in our natural gas service territory.
Marsh noted that the utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina approved several increases in the cost of gas component of retail natural gas rates for PSNC Energy and SCE&G in the fourth quarter of 2005 that allowed those companies to recover substantial increases in the cost of wholesale natural gas, due in part to supply disruptions caused by damage to production and distribution facilities from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Although neither company earns a profit on the cost of gas component of rates, such adjustments allow recovery of higher fuel costs on a timely basis.
In January and February 2006, we were able to lower the cost of gas component of rates for our natural gas customers in both states, said Marsh. Those rate reductions reflected a decrease in the wholesale price of natural gas due primarily to unseasonably mild weather in late December 2005 and January 2006. Our variable natural gas rates in Georgia have also trended downward for the same reason.
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
SCANAs principal subsidiary reported 2005 full year earnings of $256 million, or $2.25 per share, compared to $235 million, or $2.11 per share, in 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2005, SCE&G reported earnings of $60 million, or $.52 per share, compared to $40 million, or $.36 per share in the same quarter in 2004. The year-over-year earnings improvement was attributable primarily to higher electric margins resulting from customer growth, off-system sales and the retail rate increase that was effective in January 2005. The improvement in fourth quarter earnings was due to these same factors as well as colder weather. These positive factors more than offset increases in expenses and share dilution. At year-end 2005, SCE&G was serving approximately 610,000 electric and 292,000 natural gas customers, representing increases of 3.1 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, over the past year.
 
 
PSNC Energy
SCANAs North Carolina-based natural gas distribution business reported earnings in 2005 of $26 million, or $.23 per share, compared to $24 million, or $.21 per share, in 2004. The improvement was due primarily to a higher sales margin driven by customer growth. During 2005, PSNCs customer base increased by 4 percent to approximately 425,500 at year-end.
Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $9 million, or $.08 per share, compared to $11 million, or $.10 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. That decline was primarily attributable to increased operating and maintenance expenses.
South Carolina Pipeline Corporation
The Companys intrastate natural gas transmission business had reported earnings in 2005 of $10 million, or $.09 per share, unchanged compared to 2004. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $2 million, or $.02 per share, also unchanged compared to the same period in 2004.
SCANA Energy - Georgia
SCANAs retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia recorded earnings of $24 million, or $.21 per share, in 2005, compared to $29 million, or $.26 per share, in 2004. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $4 million, or $.03 per share, compared to $6 million, or $.05 per share in 2004. The decline in earnings in both periods was attributable to higher operating and customer service expenses and increased marketing costs, which more than offset a slightly higher sales margin. At year- end 2005, SCANA Energy was serving more than 475,000 customers, maintaining its position as the second largest natural gas marketer in Georgia with a market share of about 30 percent.
Corporate and Other
Reported earnings for SCANAs corporate and other businesses, which include Primesouth, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing, SCG Pipeline, SCANA Services and the holding company, were $3 million, or $.03 per share, in 2005, compared to a loss of $41 million, or $.37 per share, in 2004. Excluding from reported earnings the impact of the monetization and valuation of the Companys telecommunications investments in both periods and the charge in 2004 related to pending litigation associated with the sale of the Companys propane assets, these companies recorded breakeven results in 2005, unchanged compared to 2004.
For the fourth quarter of 2005, these businesses reported breakeven results, compared to a reported loss of $18 million, or $.16 per share, in the same quarter in 2004. Excluding from the prior years reported earnings the impact of the monetization and valuation of the Companys telecommunications investments, these businesses recorded a GAAP-adjusted net loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 of $3 million, or $.02 per share.
EXPLANATION OF ITEMS INCLUDED IN REPORTED (GAAP) EARNINGS BUT EXCLUDED FROM GAAP-ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS
In May 2005, SCANA received approximately $6 million (pre-tax) from the prior sale of its investment in ITC Holding Company. These additional sales proceeds had been held in escrow pending resolution of certain contingencies and resulted in the recording of a net after-tax gain of approximately $4 million, or $.03 per share, in the second quarter of 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an after-tax, non-cash impairment of approximately $15 million, or $.13 per share, related to the valuation of its investment in Knology, a regional telecommunications provider headquartered in West Point, Georgia, and an after-tax charge of $11 million, or $.10 per share, related to pending litigation associated with the sale of the Companys propane assets in 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $9 million, or $.08 cents per share, on the sale of its investment in Knology, and a loss of approximately $6 million, or $.06 cents per share, from the sale of its investment in ITC^DeltaCom, a provider of telecommunications services in the Southeast.
2006 EARNINGS OUTLOOK
For 2006, the Company estimates that earnings will be in the range of $2.80 - $2.95 per share.
This guidance assumes normal weather in the Companys electric and natural gas service areas and excludes any potential gains or losses from litigation, changes in accounting policies or sales of certain assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in the Companys Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Note (1): In January 2005, the South Carolina Public Service Commission approved an accounting methodology
which allows the Company to recover the cost of the Lake Murray back-up dam project through the application of
net synthetic fuel tax credits generated from its synthetic fuel partnerships. Under this methodology, beginning
January 1, 2005, the Company recognized its accumulated synthetic fuel tax credits to offset an equal amount of
accelerated depreciation on the dam project, net of partnership losses and income tax benefits. Recognition of
accelerated depreciation related to the back-up dam costs will continue quarterly to the extent net synthetic fuel
tax credits are earned. While these entries resulted in a reduction in operating income for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, there was no impact on net income. However, the Company is allowed to record non-cash carrying costs on the unrecovered investment. The impact of these entries in the Income Statement and Balance Sheet is shown in the tables below:
