ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
The information included in this filing is consistent with information SCANA Corporation (SCANA) expects to include in its 2006 Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about March 17, 2006.
On February 16, 2006, the Board of Directors of SCANA approved the payout of performance bonuses under SCANAs 2005 Annual Incentive Plan (the 2005 Annual Plan) and Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (the Long-Term Plan) for 2003-2005. The determination of payouts under the 2005 Annual Plan is consistent with the determination of payouts under previous years Annual Incentive Plans, the basic form of which plans was originally approved by the Board of Directors in 1987. The Long-Term Plan was originally approved by the shareholders of SCANA in 2000 and again in 2005. Cash payments were approved for all participants, which include the following executive officers of SCANA:
 
Also on February 16, 2006, the Board of Directors of SCANA approved criteria for performance bonuses under SCANAs 2006 Annual Incentive Plan (the 2006 Annual Plan) and Long-Term Plan for 2006-2008 (collectively, the Plans). These criteria are applicable to all participants in the Plans, which include executive officers of SCANA. The Board of Directors also approved February 2006 - January 2007 annual base salary amounts and Plan target awards for these executive officers.
Base Salary
Annual base salaries for the executives are unchanged from 2005-2006 levels.
 
 
2006 Annual Plan
Performance criteria for the 2006 Annual Plan place emphasis on achieving profitability targets and on meeting annual business objectives relating to such matters as efficiency, quality of service, customer satisfaction and progress toward SCANAs strategic objectives. The 2006 Annual Plan allows for an adjustment of an award based upon an evaluation of individual performance. Each award may be increased or decreased by no more than 20% based on the individual performance evaluation, but in no case may an award exceed the maximum payout of 1.5 times target.
 
Long-Term Plan (2006-2008)
Target awards under the Long-Term Plan (2006-2008) consisted of two types of performance shares.
Performance Share Awards - TSR (60%)
Sixty percent of target performance share awards are based upon a comparison of SCANAs total shareholder return (TSR) performance against a peer group for the three-year plan performance cycle. Payouts vary according to SCANAs ranking against the peer group. No payout is earned if SCANAs relative TSR places it below the 33
rd
percentile of the peer group. Executives earn threshold payouts (50% of target award) if SCANA ranks at the 33
rd
percentile in relation to the peer groups three-year performance. Target payouts (100% of target award) occur if SCANA ranks at the 50
th
percentile in relation to the peer groups three-year performance. Maximum payouts (150% of target award) result if SCANAs performance ranks at or above the 75
th
percentile in relation to the peer groups three-year performance.
Performance Share Awards - EPS Growth (40%)
Forty percent of target performance share awards are based upon SCANAs three-year growth in earnings per share (EPS) from ongoing operations. Payouts vary according to goal achievement. No payout is earned if EPS growth is less than the minimum of the pre-established growth range. Executives earn threshold payouts (50% of target award) upon achievement of the pre-established minimum three-year EPS growth. Target payouts (100% of target award) occur if SCANA achieves targeted three-year EPS growth. Maximum payouts (150% of target award) result if SCANAs performance is at or above the pre-established maximum three-year EPS growth.
Payments of both types of awards are calculated using a sliding scale for performance between threshold and target and target and maximum levels. Awards are designated as hypothetical shares of SCANA common stock and may be paid in stock or cash or a combination of stock and cash at SCANAs discretion.
A Performance Share Awards - TSR (60%)
B Performance Share Awards - EPS Growth (40%)
