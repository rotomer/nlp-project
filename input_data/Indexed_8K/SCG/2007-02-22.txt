On February 15, 2007, the Board of Directors of SCANA Corporation (SCANA) adopted criteria for performance bonuses for the years 2007 through 2009 under SCANAs Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan). The criteria for the 2007-2009 Plan performance cycle provide that participants performance will be measured and awards determined for each year in the three-year performance cycle rather than for the entire performance cycle, as had been the case for prior performance cycles. Although participants performance will be measured and awards may be earned annually, payment for any such annual award will be deferred until after the end of the three-year cycle and will not be made to a participant if the participant is not employed by SCANA or its affiliate at the end of the cycle, subject to certain exceptions in the event of retirement, death or disability.  The other performance criteria adopted by SCANA's Board of Directors for the 2007-2009 Plan performance cycle do not differ materially from the 2006-2008 Plan performance cycle.  Each of SCANAs named executive officers participates in the Plan.
   On the same day, SCANAs Board of Directors approved base salaries for SCANAs named executive officers and criteria for performance bonuses under SCANAs Short-Term Incentive Plan, in which each of SCANAs named executive officers participates, for the year 2007. Such base salaries and performance bonus criteria do not differ materially from year 2006 levels.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
   SCANA Corporation
