The SCANA Corporation Stock Purchase-Savings Plan (the Plan) is transitioning to a new recordkeeping system.  The transition will require a blackout period during which eligible employees will be unable to enroll in the Plan and participants in the Plan will be temporarily unable to change their contribution rates, direct or diversify investments in their individual accounts (including accounts that hold SCANA Corporation common stock), or obtain loans or distributions from the Plan.  The blackout period will also apply to the SCANA Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan to the extent that the same or similar rights normally are available under that plan.
 
On February 5, 2008, SCANA Corporation (SCANA) received notice of the blackout period from the Plan administrator.  On February 11, 2008, SCANA sent a notice of the blackout period (the Notice) to its directors and executive officers informing them that a blackout period is expected to be in effect beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on March 13, 2008 and ending at 8 a.m. Eastern Time on March 19, 2008.  The Notice was provided to the Companys directors and executive officers pursuant to the requirements of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation BTR, and a copy of the Notice is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
