Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
The undersigned SCANA Corporation, a South Carolina corporation (the Company), addresses you as the representatives (the Representatives) of each of the persons, firms and corporations listed in Schedule A hereto (the Agents).
 
The term Representatives as used herein shall be deemed to mean the firms and/or corporations addressed hereby.  If there is only one firm or corporation to which this Agreement (the Agreement) is addressed, such term shall be deemed to mean such firm or corporation.  If there are any Agents in addition to yourselves, you represent that you have been authorized by each of the Agents to enter into this Agreement on their behalf and to act for them in the manner herein provided in all matters relating to carrying out the provisions of this Agreement.  If there are no Agents other than yourselves, the term Agents shall be deemed to mean the Representatives.  All obligations of the Agents hereunder are several and not joint.
 
The Company confirms its agreement with each of you as evidenced by this Agreement with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Medium Term Notes due April 1, 2020 (the Notes). The Notes will be issued under an indenture (the Indenture) dated as of November 1, 1989 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee).  No amendment to the Indenture is to be made prior to the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) unless the amendment is approved by the Representatives.  The Notes will be issued in fully registered form in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in denominations exceeding such amount by integral multiples of $1,000, and will have the annual interest rates, maturities and other terms set forth in the Disclosure Package (as hereinafter defined) or the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) and shall otherwise conform to the provisions of the Indenture. The Notes will be issued, and the terms thereof established, in accordance with the Indenture.
 
1.           .  The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Agent that:
Representations and Warranties
 
(a)           The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-145208), which contains a base prospectus (the Base Prospectus) to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Notes.  Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, at each time of effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the Act), including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the Exchange Act), is called the Registration Statement.  The Company has prepared and filed with the Commission a prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus (the Base Prospectus as so supplemented, the Supplemented Base Prospectus).  The term Prospectus shall mean the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes, together with the Supplemented Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto (the Execution Time).  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Supplemented Base Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein (the Incorporated Documents); any reference to any amendment or supplement to the Supplemented Base Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any Incorporated Documents filed after the date of such Supplemented Base Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such Supplemented Base Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any document of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Supplemented Base Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (EDGAR).
 
(b)           The Registration Statement (i) is an automatic shelf registration statement as defined in Rule 405 under the Act and (ii) initially became effective not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date (hereinafter defined), and the Company has not received any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act.  The Registration Statement has been prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the Trust Indenture Act).  When the Registration Statement initially became effective and at all times subsequent thereto up to and on the Closing Date (hereinafter defined), (y) the Registration Statement and Prospectus and any post-effective amendments or supplements thereto contained and will contain all statements and information that are required to be stated therein by the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and in all material respects, conformed and will conform to the requirements thereof; and (z) neither the Registration Statement nor the Prospectus nor any post-effective amendment or supplement thereto included or will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the foregoing representations and warranties shall not apply to information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by you, or by any Agent through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof, or to any statements in or omissions from the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) of the Trustee or to any information relating to the book-entry system of payments and transfers of the Notes or the depository therefor set forth under the caption Book-Entry System provided by The Depository Trust Company.  A copy of such Registration Statement and any amendments thereto heretofore filed (including all exhibits except those incorporated therein by reference) have heretofore been delivered to you.  The Company will file with the Commission the Prospectus relating to the Notes pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act.
 
(c)           The term Disclosure Package shall mean (i) the Supplemented Base Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, (ii) the issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 of the Act (each, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), if any, identified in Schedule C hereto, (iii) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package and (iv) the Final Term Sheet (as defined herein), which also shall be identified in Schedule C hereto.  As of 5:30 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement (the Applicable Time), the Disclosure Package did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the foregoing representations and warranties shall not apply to information contained in or omitted from the Disclosure Package in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by you, or by any Agent through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof, or to any information relating to the book-entry system of payments and transfers of the Notes or the depository therefor set forth under the caption Book-Entry System provided by The Depository Trust Company.
 
(d)           At the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this sentence), the Company was and is a well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 of the Act.
 
(e)           (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement relating to the Notes that the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Act) of the Notes and (ii) as of the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (ii)), the Company was not and is not an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405 of the Act), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 of the Act that it is not necessary that the Company be considered an ineligible issuer.
bona fide
 
(f)           Neither any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus nor the Final Term Sheet, as of their respective issue dates and at all subsequent times during the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined herein) or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Representatives as described in the next sentence, did not, does not and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, including any document incorporated by reference therein that has not been superseded or modified.  If at any time following the issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the Company has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Representatives and has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict.
 
(g)           The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Date and the completion of the Agents distribution of the Notes, any written offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Notes other than the Supplemented Base Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Representatives and included in Schedule C hereto or the Registration Statement.
 
(h)           The Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed, authenticated and issued as provided in the Indenture and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and by general equity principles) and entitled to the security and benefits of the Indenture, and will conform to the description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.  The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability of such agreement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and by general equity principles), and the Indenture conforms to the description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
(i)           Each of the Company; South Carolina Electric & Gas Company; Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated; SCANA Energy Marketing, Inc.;and any other significant subsidiary within the meaning of Rule 405 of the Act (individually a Subsidiary and collectively the Subsidiaries) has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized, with full corporate power and authority to own and operate the properties now or proposed to be owned by it and to conduct its business as now being or proposed to be conducted by it, in each case as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such licensing or qualification wherein it owns or leases material properties or conducts material business.
 
 
(j)           All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries are owned by the Company either directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security interest and, to the knowledge of the Company, after due inquiry, any other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances.
 
(k)           The Companys authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the Registration Statement.
 
(l)           The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, will not be, an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company that is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
(m)           This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
(n)           Except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the respective most recent dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements after the date hereof), the Company has not incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, or entered into any transactions, not in the ordinary course of business, which are material to the Company, and there has not been any material change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company, or any material adverse change, or any development which the Company has reasonable cause to believe will involve a prospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business, net worth or results of operations of the Company, from that set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement) (a Material Adverse Effect).
 
(o)           The Incorporated Documents, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder at that time, and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference, when they become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
(p)           The consolidated financial statements of the Company incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus fairly present the financial condition of the Company as of the dates indicated and the results of operations, cash flows and changes in common equity for the periods therein specified; and said financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), applied on a consistent basis (except as otherwise noted in such financial statements) throughout the periods involved.

There are no contracts or documents of the Company that are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement by the Act or by the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder that have not been so filed.
 
(r)           The performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement or other  agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of the property of the Company is subject, the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or by-laws, or any statute, law, rule, regulation, order or decree of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the issuance or sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder, except such as may be required under the Act, the Trust  Indenture Act or state securities laws, and the Company has full power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Notes on the terms and conditions herein set forth.
 
(s)           The Company maintains systems of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, and the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
 
(t)           Except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the end of the Companys most recent audited fiscal year, there has been (i) no material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and (ii) no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

(v)           To the best of its knowledge, the Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) that are effective and the rules and regulations of the Commission that have been adopted and are effective thereunder.
 
Any certificate signed by an officer of the Company and delivered to one or more Representatives or to counsel for the Representatives in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to the Agents as to the matters covered thereby on the date of such certificate.
 
2.           .  On the basis of representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to the several Agents named in Schedule A hereto, and each such Agent agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company at the initial purchase price set forth in Schedule B hereto the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the name of such Agent in Schedule A.

In connection with any resale of Notes purchased, an Agent may use a selling or dealer group and may reallow any portion of the discount or commission payable pursuant hereto to dealers or purchasers.
Purchase, Sale and Delivery of the Notes
 
The closing of the transactions and delivery of the documents contemplated hereby shall take place at the office, date and time specified in Schedule B.  The Notes will be delivered by the Company to you for the accounts of the several Agents through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company against payment of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer in federal (same day) funds at the closing date and time specified in Schedule B (or, if the New York and American Stock Exchanges and commercial banks in The City of New York are not open on such day, the next day on which such exchanges and banks are open), or at such other time not later than eight full business days thereafter as you and the Company determine, such time being herein referred to as the Closing Date.
 
It is understood that you, individually and not as Representatives of the Agents, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment to the Company, on behalf of any Agent or Agents, for the Notes to be purchased by such Agent or Agents.  Any such payment by you shall not relieve any such Agent or Agents of any of its or their obligations hereunder.
 
3.           .  The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent that:
Agreements
 
(a)           During the period beginning at the Applicable Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date or such date the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Agent or dealer, including circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the Act (the Prospectus Delivery Period), prior to amending or supplementing the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement through incorporation by reference of any report filed under the Exchange Act), the Company shall furnish to the Representatives for review a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement; the Company shall not file or use any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object (except for any amendment or supplement through incorporation by reference of any report filed under the Exchange Act); the Company will notify you promptly of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or for additional information.
 
(b)           During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act and comply as far as it is able with all requirements imposed upon it by the Act, as now and hereafter amended, and by the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Notes as contemplated by the provisions hereof and in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
(c)           If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if in the opinion of the Representatives it is otherwise necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Notes by the Agents to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the Representatives of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to Sections 3(a) and 3(e) hereof), file with the Commission (and use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement declared effective) and furnish at its own expense to the Agents and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, as the case may be, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.  The Company will notify you of the time when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement to the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus has been filed.
 
           
(d)
The Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Notes, in a form approved by the Representatives and contained in Schedule D hereto, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the Final Term Sheet).
 
(e)           The Company represents that it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 of the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect to the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule C hereto.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives and the Company is hereinafter referred to as a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.  The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
 
 
 
 
(f)           The Company will advise you, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any proceeding for that purpose having been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and it will promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such a stop order should be issued.
 
(g)           If the Prospectus Delivery Period is ongoing immediately prior to the third anniversary (the Renewal Deadline) of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Agents.  If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Agents, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Notes.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
 
(h)           If at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Agents, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Agents, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Agents of such effectiveness.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
 
(i)           The Company agrees to pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Act without regard to the proviso in clause (b)(1)(i) therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Act.
 
(j)           The Company will use its best efforts, at the request of and in cooperation with the Representatives, to qualify the Notes for sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you reasonably designate and to continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes, except that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith to qualify as a foreign corporation or to execute a general consent to service of process in any state.  The Company will also arrange for the determination of the Notes eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as you reasonably request.
 
(k)           The Company has furnished or will furnish to the Agents, as soon as available, copies of the Registration Statement (three of which will be signed and will include all exhibits except those incorporated by reference), the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference therein but excluding exhibits to such documents), the Supplemented Base Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses and all amendments and supplements to such documents, including any prospectus prepared to permit compliance with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act, all in such quantities as you may from time to time reasonably request.
 
(l)           The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 15 months after the end of the Companys current fiscal quarter, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) covering a 12-month period beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act.
 
(m)           So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Company agrees to furnish to you, and, upon request, to each of the other Agents, (i) as soon as they are available, copies of all the reports (financial or other) and any definitive proxy statements mailed to security holders or filed with the Commission and (ii) from time to time such other information concerning the business and financial condition of the Company as you may reasonably request.
 
(n)           The Company, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereunder are consummated or this Agreement is prevented from becoming effective or is terminated under the provisions of Section 7 hereof, will pay all costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Companys accountants and counsel for the Company, all costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Act of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Supplemented Base Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and all amendments and supplements thereto, any fees charged by any investment rating agencies for rating the Notes, all fees and disbursements incurred by the Company and by the Agents in connection with the qualification of the Notes under the laws of various jurisdictions as provided in Section 3(j) hereof and the determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of various jurisdictions (including the cost of furnishing to the Agents memoranda relating thereto and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agents in connection therewith), the cost of furnishing to the Agents copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Supplemented Base Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and each amendment and supplement thereto, in such numbers as you may reasonably request, the costs and charges of the Trustee and of any depository in connection with a book-entry system of payments and transfers, and the cost of preparing the Notes.

It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties.  All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred.  An indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 5 (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding.
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable under subsection (a) or (b) above to a party that would have been an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above (Indemnified Party) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each party that would have been an indemnifying party thereunder (Indemnifying Party) shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the Indemnified Party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Agents, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus which is filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act referred to in Section 1(a) hereof.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Agents and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in subsection (c) above if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Agents obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)           The obligations of the Company under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director, officer, agent and to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Agents under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
6.           .
Substitution of Agents
 
(a)           If any Agent or Agents shall fail to take up and pay for the principal amount of Notes agreed by such Agent or Agents to be purchased hereunder, upon tender of such Notes in accordance with the terms hereof, and the principal amount of Notes not purchased does not aggregate more than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, the remaining Agents shall be obligated to take up and pay for (in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder except as may otherwise be determined by you) the Notes which any withdrawing or defaulting Agents agreed but failed to purchase; however, if such Notes not purchased aggregate more than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, the remaining Agents shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to take up and pay for (in such proportions as shall be determined by you) the Notes which the defaulting Agent or Agents agreed but failed to purchase.  If such remaining Agents do not, at the Closing Date, take up and pay for the Notes which the defaulting Agent or Agents agreed but failed to purchase, the time for delivery of the Notes shall be extended to the next business day to allow the several Agents the privilege of substituting within 24 hours (including non-business hours) another agent or agents satisfactory to the Company.  If no such agent or agents shall have been substituted, as aforesaid, the time for delivery of the Notes may, at the option of the Company, be again extended to the next following business day, if necessary, to allow the Company the privilege of finding within 24 hours (including non-business hours) another agent or agents, satisfactory to you, to purchase the Notes which the defaulting Agent or Agents agreed but failed to purchase.  If the remaining Agents shall not take up and pay for all such Notes agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Agents, or substitute another agent or agents as aforesaid, and the Company shall not find or shall not elect to seek another agent or agents for such Notes as aforesaid, then this Agreement shall terminate.  In the event of any such termination the Company shall not be under any liability to any Agent (except to the extent provided in Section 3(n) and in Section 5 hereof), nor shall any Agent (other than an Agent who shall have failed, otherwise than for some reason permitted under this Agreement, to purchase the principal amount of Notes agreed by such Agent to be purchased hereunder) be under any liability to the Company (except to the extent provided in Section 5 hereof).
 
(b)           If the remaining Agents or substituted agents take up the Notes of the defaulting Agent or Agents as provided in this Section, (i) the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of delivery for a period of not more than seven full business days, in order to effect any changes which may be made necessary thereby in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees promptly to file any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which may be made necessary thereby, and (ii) the respective principal amounts of Notes to be purchased by the remaining Agents or substituted agents shall be taken as the basis of their respective underwriting obligations for all purposes of this Agreement.  A substituted agent hereunder shall become an Agent for all purposes of this Agreement.
 
(c)           Nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Agent from liability for its default.
 
7.           .
Termination
 
(a)           This Agreement shall become effective upon your accepting it in the manner indicated below.
 
(b)           You, as Representatives of the several Agents, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving notice as hereinafter specified at any time at or prior to the Closing Date if (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any material agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any other condition of the Agents obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, (iii) trading on The New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange shall have been wholly suspended, (iv) minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall have been required, on The New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, by The New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction, (v) a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York authorities, or (vi) an outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, a declaration of war by Congress, any other substantial national or international calamity or crisis, a default in payment when due of interest on or principal of any debt obligations of, or the institution of proceedings under the Federal bankruptcy laws by or against, any State of the United States, a material disruption in settlement or clearance procedures, or any other event or occurrence of a similar character shall have occurred since the execution of this Agreement which, in your judgment, makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the sale of and payment for the Notes.  Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 3(n) and Section 5 hereof shall at all times be effective.
 
(c)           If you elect to prevent this Agreement from becoming effective or to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section, the Company shall be notified promptly by you by telephone or facsimile, confirmed by letter.  If the Company elects to prevent this Agreement from becoming effective, you shall be notified promptly by the Company by telephone or facsimile, confirmed by letter.
