Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
Individually and Acting as Representative for
the Underwriters Named in Schedule A hereto
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
The undersigned SCANA Corporation, a South Carolina corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of the Company's Common Stock, no par value per share (the "Common Stock"), to you and to the other underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters"), for which you are acting as representative (the "Representative").  The Company has also agreed to grant to you and the other Underwriters an option (the "Option") to purchase up to an additional 375,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Shares") on the terms and for the purposes set forth in Section 1(b).  The Firm Shares and the Option Shares are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Shares."
 
The term "Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the firm(s) and/or corporation(s) addressed hereby.  If there is only one firm or corporation to which this Underwriting Agreement (the "Agreement") is addressed, such term shall be deemed to mean such firm or corporation.  If there are any Underwriters in addition to yourself, you represent that you have been authorized by each of the Underwriters to enter into this Agreement on their behalf and to act for them in the manner herein provided in all matters relating to carrying out the provisions of this Agreement.  If there are no Underwriters other than yourself, the term "Underwriters" shall be deemed to mean the Representative.  All obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are several and not joint.
 
The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters as follows:
 
.
1.
                                      
Agreement to Sell and Purchase
 
On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter named in Schedule A hereto, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule A, plus such additional number of Firm Shares which such Underwriter may become obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 8 hereof, in each case at a purchase price of $34.9675 per Share, representing a public offering price per Share of $35.50 after discounts and commissions of $0.5325 per Share.
(a)
                                 
 
Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company grants the Option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 375,000 Option Shares from the Company at the same price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Firm Shares.  The Option may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Shares by the Underwriters and may be exercised in whole or in part at any time (but not more than once) on or before the 30 day after the date of this Agreement, upon written or telegraphic notice (the "Option Shares Notice") by the Representative to the Company no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, at least two and no more than five business days before the date specified for closing in the Option Shares Notice (the "Option Closing Date") setting forth the aggregate number of Option Shares to be purchased and the time and date for such purchase.  On the Option Closing Date, the Company will issue and sell to the Underwriters the number of Option Shares set forth in the Option Shares Notice, and each Underwriter will purchase such percentage of the Option Shares as is equal to the percentage of Firm Shares that such Underwriter is purchasing, as adjusted by the Representative in such manner as it deems advisable to avoid fractional shares.

Delivery and Payment
.  The closing of the transactions and delivery of the documents contemplated hereby shall take place at the office, date (the "Closing Date") and time specified in Schedule B.  Payment of the purchase price for the Firm Shares shall be made to the Company to you by wire transfer in federal (same day) funds against delivery of the certificates for the Firm Shares for registration in such names as the Underwriters shall direct, at the closing date and time specified on Schedule B (or, if the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), the American Stock Exchange (the "AMEX") and commercial banks in The City of New York are not open on such day, the next day on which such exchanges and banks are open), or at such other time not later than eight full business days thereafter as you and the Company determine, such time being herein referred to as the "Closing Date."  Electronic transfer of the Firm Shares shall be made to you on the Closing Date at the time of closing in such names and in such denominations as you shall specify.
 
Payment of the purchase price for the Option Shares shall be made on the Option Closing Date in the same manner and at the same time of day as the payment for the Firm Shares (unless another time shall be agreed to by you and the Company).  Electronic transfer of the Option Shares shall be made to you on the Option Closing Date at the time of closing in such names and in such denominations as you shall specify. The Company agrees to make certificates for the Shares available to you for your review at least one full business day preceding the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be.
 
It is understood that you, individually and not as the Representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment to the Company, on behalf of any Underwriter or Underwriters, for the Shares to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters.  Any such payment by you shall not relieve any such Underwriter or Underwriters of any of its or their obligations hereunder.
 
.  The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:

Representations and Warranties of the Company
 
(a)
                                 
The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-145208), which contains a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale of the Shares.  Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, at each time of effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Act"), including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at the
time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), is called the "Registration Statement."  Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Shares and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "preliminary prospectus."  The term "Prospectus" shall mean the final prospectus supplement relating to the Shares (the "Prospectus Supplement"), together with the Base Prospectus, that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto (the "Execution Time").  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"); any reference to any amendment or supplement to any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any Incorporated Documents filed after the date of such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such preliminary prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System or any successor system thereto ("EDGAR").
 
(b)
                                
The Registration Statement (i) is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act and (ii) initially became effective not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date, and the Company has not received any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act.  The Registration Statement has been prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the Act.  When the Registration Statement initially became effective and at all times subsequent thereto up to and on the Closing Date, (i) the Registration Statement and Prospectus and any post-effective amendments or supplements thereto contained and will contain all statements and information which are required to be stated therein by the Act and in all material respects, conformed and will conform to the requirements thereof; and (ii) neither the Registration Statement nor the Prospectus nor any post-effective amendment or supplement thereto included or will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the foregoing representations and warranties shall not apply to information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by you, or by any Underwriter through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof.  A copy of such Registration Statement and any amendments thereto heretofore filed (including all exhibits except those incorporated therein by reference) have heretofore been delivered to you.  The Company will file with the Commission any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus relating to the Shares pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act.
 
The term "Disclosure Package" shall mean (i) the Base Prospectus, including any preliminary prospectus supplement, as amended or supplemented, (ii) the "issuer free writing prospectuses" as defined in Rule 433 of the Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), if any, identified in Schedule C hereto, and (iii) any other free writing prospectus that the parties
(c)
                                 
hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package.  As of 5:30 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of this Agreement (the "Applicable Time"), the Disclosure Package did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the foregoing representations and warranties shall not apply to information contained in or omitted from the Prospectus, including any preliminary prospectus supplement, or any such amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by you, or by any Underwriter through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof.
 
At the Execution Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this sentence), the Company was and is a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 of the Act.
(d)
                                
 
(e)
                                 
Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has not, directly or indirectly, offered or sold any Shares by means of any "prospectus" (within the meaning of the Act) or used any "prospectus" (within the meaning of the Act) in connection with the offer or sale of the Shares, in each case other than the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, if any; the Company has not, directly or indirectly, prepared, used or referred to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus except in compliance with Rule 163 or with Rules 164 and 433 under the Act; the conditions set forth in one or more of subclauses (i) through (iv), inclusive, of Rule 433(b)(1) under the Act are satisfied; neither the Company nor the Underwriters are disqualified, by reason of subsection (f) or (g) of Rule 164 under the Act, from using, in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares, "free writing prospectuses" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) pursuant to Rules 164 and 433 under the Act; and the Company is not an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) as of the eligibility determination date for purposes of Rules 164 and 433 under the Act with respect to the offering of the Shares contemplated by the Registration Statement.
 
The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Date or the completion of the Underwriters' distribution of the Shares, any written offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares other than a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus which is either included in Schedule C hereto or reviewed and consented to by the Representative, or the Registration Statement.
(f)
                                   
 
Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as of its respective issue date and at all subsequent times during the Prospectus Delivery Period (as defined herein) or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Representative as described in the next sentence, did not, does not and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, including any document incorporated by reference therein that has not been superseded or modified.  If at any time following the issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the Company has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Representative and has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict.
(g)

All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries are owned by the Company either directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security interest and, to the knowledge of the Company, after due inquiry, any other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances.
 
(k)
                                 
The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" that is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

There exists no condition that, with notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default by the Company or the Subsidiaries under any such document or instrument or result in the imposition of any penalty or the acceleration of any indebtedness other than penalties, defaults or conditions that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

No consent, approval, authorizations or other order of, or registration or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency or, to counsel's knowledge, any court, is required for the Company's execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, or the issuance, sale and delivery of the Shares or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents

The statements made in each of the
Disclosure Package
and the Prospectus under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-
 
U.S. Holders"
insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute fair and accurate summaries of the U.S. federal tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Shares
.
 
In rendering such opinion, but without opining in connection therewith, such counsel shall also state that, based upon such counsel's participation in conferences with representatives of the Company and the Company's accountants and participation in certain prior financings of the Company, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that would cause such counsel to believe that (i) any of the documents incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus when they were filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; (ii) either the Registration Statement or any amendments thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or such amendments became effective and as of the Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date or at the Closing Date contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iv) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except, in each case, that such counsel need not express any belief as to financial statements and schedules, financial and statistical data derived therefrom and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any amendments or supplements thereto or as to the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and, with respect to information relating to the book-entry system of payments and transfers set forth under the caption "Book-Entry System" therein, such counsel may state that its opinion is based solely on information made available by The Depository Trust Company for the purpose of inclusion in the Prospectus and further that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus prior to the date of this Agreement).
 
(h)
          
On the Closing Date, you shall have received the opinion of Francis P. Mood, Jr., Esquire, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of the Company, dated the Closing Date, covering the matters set forth in clauses (i) through (v) below, in each case subject to such exceptions specified in such opinion with respect to the matters referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph (h) as such counsel may deem appropriate, which exceptions in the opinion of the counsel rendering such opinion do not materially interfere with the maintenance and operation by the Company of the properties now owned by it or with the conduct by the Company of the business now carried on by it.
 
(i)
           
Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries (A) has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of South Carolina, the jurisdiction in which each is chartered and organized, with the corporate power to own and operate its properties now owned and proposed to be owned by it and
conduct its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, in each case as described in the
Registration Statement, the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, (B) 
is duly licensed or qualified in each jurisdiction which requires such licensing or qualification wherein it owns material properties or conducts material business, and (C) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership or leasing of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(ii)
          
Except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the Company has such licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations and/or orders of governmental bodies, political subdivisions or regulatory authorities, as are necessary for the acquisition, construction, ownership, maintenance and operation of the properties now owned by it and the conduct of the business now carried on by it as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and the Company is not in default or violation of any of the foregoing and is carrying on its business in accordance therewith and, to his knowledge, with all applicable federal, state and other laws and regulations, except as would not materially adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.
 
(iii)
         
The descriptions in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus of statutes, legal and governmental proceedings, contracts and other documents are, to the best of his knowledge, accurate and fairly present the information required to be shown therein, and such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which are not described as required, nor of any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or required to be incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described or incorporated by reference or filed as required.
 
(iv)
         
The consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and the fulfillment of the terms hereof will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any statute, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of the property of the Company or its subsidiaries is subject, or the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or bylaws of the Company, or to his knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than with respect to federal or state securities laws or blue sky laws of any other jurisdiction) of any court or of any federal or state regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company or its property.
 
(v)
          
After due inquiry, such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and are not so described or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration
Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to be filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described, filed or incorporated as required.
 
In rendering such opinion, but without opining in connection therewith, such counsel shall also state that, based upon such counsel's participation in conferences with representatives of the Company and the Company's accountants and participation in certain prior financings of the Company, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that would cause such counsel to believe that (i) any of the documents incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus when they were filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; (ii) either the Registration Statement or any amendments thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or such amendments became effective and as of the Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date or at the Closing Date contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iv) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except, in each case, that such counsel need not express any belief as to financial statements and schedules, financial and statistical data derived therefrom and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any amendments or supplements thereto or as to the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and, with respect to information relating to the book-entry system of payments and transfers set forth under the caption "Book-Entry System" therein, such counsel may state that its opinion is based solely on information made available by The Depository Trust Company for the purpose of inclusion in the Prospectus) and further that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus prior to the date of this Agreement).
 
(i)
           
On the Closing Date, you shall have received from Troutman Sanders LLP, counsel for the several Underwriters, such opinion or opinions with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Shares, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and other related matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.  In rendering their opinion, such counsel may rely upon the opinion of Francis P. Mood, Jr., Esquire, referred to above as to all matters governed by South Carolina law.
 
(j)
           
On or prior to the date hereof, you shall have received a letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP, dated the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and specifying procedures completed not more than three business days prior to the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, addressed to you and in form and substance satisfactory to you, (1) confirming that they are independent accountants with respect to the Company as required by the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (2) with respect to the
accounting, financing, or statistical information (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company) contained in the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, and containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' SAS 72, as amended by SAS 86, "Comfort Letters" to underwriters, with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, including any pro forma financial information.  At the Closing Date, you shall have received a letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP, dated the date of its delivery, which shall reaffirm and, if necessary, update, on the basis of a review in accordance with the procedures set forth in the letter from the Accountants, during the period from the date of the letter referred to in the prior sentence to a date (specified in the letter) not more than three business days prior to the Closing Date.
 
(k)
          
On the Closing Date, you shall have received from the Company a certificate, signed by its Chairman, President or a Vice President and by its principal financial or accounting officer, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that, to the best of their knowledge based on reasonable investigation:
 
(i)
           
the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, as if made on and as of the Closing Date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii)
          
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, shall be in effect and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened by the Commission;
and
 
(iii)
         
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, contain all statements and information required to be included therein; the Registration Statement or any amendments thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or such amendments became effective and at the Execution Time, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; the Prospectus, as of its date and at the Closing Date did not and does not contain an untrue statement of a material fact and did not and does not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided, however, that in each case, no representation is made as to the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and, with respect to information relating to the book-entry system of payments and transfers set forth under the caption "Book-Entry System" therein); and, since the date hereof there has occurred no event required to be set forth in an amended or supplemented prospectus which has not been so set forth and there has been no document required to be filed under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and which upon such filing would be deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, which has not been so filed.
 
The Company shall have furnished to you such further certificates and documents as you shall have reasonably requested.
(l)
           
 
There shall not have occurred after the date hereof any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any of the Company's securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act.
(m)
         
 
All such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are satisfactory in form and substance to you.  The Company will furnish you with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents as you shall reasonably request.  In giving the opinions contemplated by paragraphs (g), (h) and (i) of this Section 5, counsel need not express any opinion either as to matters of Georgia law and may rely upon certificates of state officials as to the Company's existence and upon certificates of officers of the Company as to matters of fact relevant to such opinions and may assume that the signatures on all documents examined by them are genuine.

Indemnification and Contribution
.
 
(a)
          
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers, agents and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter, director, officer, agent or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter, director, officer, agent or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you, or by any Underwriter through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may
 
become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,  in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you, or by such Underwriter through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (2) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (3) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (4) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties.  It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties.  All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred.  An indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent will not
 
be unreasonably withheld).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 6 (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding.
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable under subsection (a) or (b) above to a party that would have been an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above ("Indemnified Party") in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each party that would have been an indemnifying party thereunder ("Indemnifying Party") shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the Indemnified Party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus which is filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act referred to in Section 3(a) hereof.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in subsection (c) above if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
 
conditions, to each director, officer and agent of an Underwriter, and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
7.
            
Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery
. All representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto, and the agreements contained in Section 4A hereto and the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section 6 hereto of the several Underwriters, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any of its directors, officers, agents or any controlling persons, or the Company or any of its officers, directors or any controlling persons and shall survive delivery of the Shares to the Underwriters hereunder.
 
8.
            
Substitution of Underwriters
.
 
(a) If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase any of the Firm Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate number of Firm Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase (in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder except as may otherwise be determined by you) the Firm Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; however, if such Firm Shares not purchased aggregate more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as shall be determined by you) the Firm Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase.  If such remaining Underwriters do not, at the Closing Date, purchase the Firm Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase, the time for delivery of the Firm Shares shall be extended to the next business day to allow the several Underwriters the privilege of substituting within 24 hours (including non-business hours) another underwriter or underwriters satisfactory to the Company.  If no such underwriter or underwriters shall have been substituted, as aforesaid, the time for delivery of the Firm Shares may, at the option of the Company, be again extended to the next following business day, if necessary, to allow the Company the privilege of finding within 24 hours (including non-business hours) another underwriter or underwriters, satisfactory to you, to purchase the Firm Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase.  If the remaining Underwriters shall not take up and pay for all such Firm Shares agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriters, or substitute another underwriter or underwriters as aforesaid, and the Company shall not find or shall not elect to seek another underwriter or underwriters for such Firm Shares as aforesaid, then this Agreement shall terminate.  In the event of any such termination the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter (except to the extent provided in Section 4(m) and in Section 6 hereof), nor shall any Underwriter (other than an Underwriter who shall have failed, otherwise than for some reason permitted under this Agreement, to purchase Firm Shares agreed by such Underwriter to be purchased hereunder) be under any liability to the Company (except to the extent provided in Section 6 hereof).
 
(b)
          
If the remaining Underwriters or substituted underwriters purchase the Firm Shares of the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters as provided in this Section 9, (i) the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of delivery for a period of not more than seven
 
full business days, in order to effect any changes which may be made necessary thereby in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees promptly to file any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which may be made necessary thereby, and (ii) the respective Firm Shares to be purchased by the remaining Underwriters or substituted underwriters shall be taken as the basis of their respective underwriting obligations for all purposes of this Agreement.  A substituted underwriter hereunder shall become an Underwriter for all purposes of this Agreement.
 
(c)
          
Nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
To induce the Underwriter that may participate in the Public Offering to continue its efforts in connection with the Public Offering, the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 30 days after the date of the final prospectus supplement relating to the Public Offering (the "Lock-Up Period"), (1) offer, pledge, sell or contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or file any registration statement with respect to the foregoing; or (2) enter into any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic equivalent of ownership of Common Stock whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise; or (3) publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, which has not previously been disclosed publicly.  The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a) transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the Public Offering, that no filing under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), shall be required or shall be voluntarily made in connection with subsequent sales of Common Stock or other securities acquired in such open market transactions, (b) transfers of shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into Common Stock as a bona fide gift; that in the case of any transfer or distribution pursuant to clause (b), (i) each donee or distributee shall sign and deliver a lock-up letter substantially in the form of this letter and (ii) no filing under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, reporting a reduction in beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock, shall be required or shall be voluntarily made during the restricted period referred to in the foregoing sentence.  In addition, the undersigned agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, it will not, during the Lock-Up Period, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock.  The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the

Company's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the undersigned's shares of Common Stock except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.
 
The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriter are relying upon this agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the Public Offering.  The undersigned further understands that this agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned's heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.
 
Whether or not the Public Offering actually occurs depends on a number of factors, including market conditions.  Any Public Offering will only be made pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, the terms of which are subject to negotiation between the Company and the Underwriter.
