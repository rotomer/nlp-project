                                               For Immediate Release
 
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008.
Columbia, SC, February 12, 2009...
FULL YEAR RESULTS
For the year ended December 31, 2008, SCANA reported earnings of $346 million or $2.95 per share, compared to $320 million, or $2.74 per share, in 2007.
We are very pleased with the overall results for 2008 and our ability to deliver value for our shareholders and customers and strong financial results, despite the economic challenges and temperate weather we experienced, said Jimmy Addison, senior vice president and chief financial officer. The Companys 2008 earnings were $2.95 per share and met our guidance.
 We are also pleased that we were able to execute a very successful equity offering at year-end in conjunction with the inclusion of SCANAs common stock in the S&P 500 Index. said Addison. The additional $100 million in equity is not reflected in the accompanying condensed financial statements, as the offering closed on January 7, 2009.
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
SCANAs reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $86 million, or 73 cents per share, compared to $88 million, or 75 cents per share, for the same quarter in 2007.
We continued to see an impact from the economic slowdown in the fourth quarter, and Decembers weather was extremely mild; however, our cost control initiatives and modest customer growth produced similar overall results to 2007.
Our gas businesses in North Carolina and Georgia produced significantly improved results in the quarter compared to 2007, while Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation (CGTC) returned to a more typical earnings level following a $.05 per share benefit in 2007 due to the sale of a bankruptcy claim, said Addison.
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
Reported earnings for 2008 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANAs principal subsidiary, were $275 million, or $2.34 per share compared to $245 million, or $2.10 per share, in 2007. SCE&G substantially under earned its allowed cost of capital in 2006 and 2007, which was the basis for the retail rate increase in January 2008.  For the fourth quarter of 2008, SCE&G reported earnings of $54 million, or 46 cents per share, compared to $56 million, or 48 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2007.  The decrease was due to higher net interest expense and operating expenses which more than offset higher electric margins arising from customer growth and a retail electric rate increase. At year-end 2008, SCE&G was serving approximately 650,000 electric customers and approximately 307,000 natural gas customers, up 1.6 and 1.5 percent, respectively, over 2007.
PSNC Energy
PSNC Energy, the Companys North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported 2008 earnings of $42 million, or 36 cents per share, compared to $35 million, or 30 cents per share, in 2007.  Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $19 million, or 17 cents per share, compared to $16 million, or 13 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Continued customer growth and the new customer usage tracker, along with lower interest expense on short-term debt, contributed to that improvement. At year end, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 468,000 customers, an increase of 2.3 percent over the previous year.
SCANA Energy  Georgia
SCANA Energy, the Companys retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported 2008 earnings of $33 million, or 28 cents per share, compared to $27 million, or 24 cents per share, in 2007. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $12 million, or 10 cents per share, compared to $8 million, or 7 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. The per share increase in both periods is attributable to higher margins and lower bad debt expense.  At December 31, 2008, SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers and continues to maintain its position as the second largest natural gas marketer in Georgia.
Carolina Gas Transmission
Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation reported earnings of $8 million, or 7 cents per share, in 2008, compared to $14 million, or 12 cents per share, in 2007. For the fourth quarter of 2008, CGTC reported earnings of $2 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to $7 million, or 6 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. The decline in earnings is due primarily to higher income in 2007 related to the sale of a bankruptcy claim. The 2008 results are more representative of the on-going nature of this cost-based pipeline business.
Corporate and Other
SCANAs corporate and other businesses, which include SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported a loss of $12 million, or 10 cents per share in 2008, compared to a loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share in 2007, For the fourth quarter of 2008, these businesses reported a loss of $2 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to earnings of $1 million, or 1 cent per share in the fourth quarter of 2007.  The decline in earnings is primarily a result of higher net interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2008.
UPDATE ON BASE LOAD REVIEW FILING
The South Carolina Public Service Commission held hearings in December on the Companys application for a combined Certificate of Environmental Compatibility, Public Convenience and Necessity and for a Base Load Review order for the construction of two nuclear units. A Base Load Review decision was issued by the Commission on February 11, 2009 with a comprehensive written order expected by the end of February. Details of our Base Load Review Application (BLRA) along with preliminary details of the decision are available on the Companys web site at .

EARNINGS OUTLOOK
For 2009, the Companys preliminary estimate is that earnings will be in the range of $2.65 to $2.95 per share.  This is a particularly challenging period in which to forecast earnings due to several factors including primarily the current economic climate.  We intend to tighten the range of this guidance as the year progresses and some of the uncertainties become quantifiable.
This estimate includes normal weather in the Companys electric and natural gas service areas for the balance of 2009 and excludes any potential impacts from changes in accounting principles and gains or losses from certain investing activities, litigation, and sales of assets. Other factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement. The Company continues to target an average annual earnings growth rate of 4 to 6 percent over the next 3-5 years.

Note (1): In January 2005, the South Carolina Public Service Commission approved an accounting methodology which has allowed the Company to recover a majority of the cost of the Lake Murray back-up dam project through the application of net synthetic fuel tax credits generated from its synthetic fuel partnerships. Under this methodology, beginning January 1, 2005, the Company recognized accumulated synthetic fuel tax credits to offset an equal amount of accelerated depreciation on the dam project, net of partnership losses and income tax benefits. The Company recorded accelerated depreciation to the extent tax credits were available. While these entries resulted in a $7.5 million increase and a $4.6 million reduction in operating income in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, these reductions were fully offset by increases or reductions in income taxes and losses from equity method investments, and there was no impact on net income.
