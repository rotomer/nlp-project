If there is only one firm or corporation to which this Underwriting Agreement (the "Agreement") is addressed, such term shall be deemed to mean such firm or corporation.  If there are any Underwriters in addition to yourselves, you represent that you have been authorized by each of the Underwriters to enter into this Agreement on their behalf and to act for them in the manner herein provided in all matters relating to carrying out the provisions of this Agreement.  If there are no Underwriters other than yourselves, the term "Underwriters" shall be

The Company has also agreed to grant to you and the other Underwriters an option (the "Option") to purchase up to an additional $0 aggregate principal amount of its 2009 Series A 7.70% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes (the "Option Notes") on the terms and for the purposes set forth in Section 3(b).

Payment of the purchase price for the Option Notes shall be made on the Option Closing Date in the same manner and at the same time of day as the payment for the Firm Notes (unless another time shall be agreed to by you and the Company).

If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if in the opinion of the Representatives it is otherwise necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Notes by the Underwriters to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the Representatives of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to Sections 4(a) and 4(e) hereof), file with the Commission (and use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement declared effective) and furnish at its own expense to the Underwriters and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented,
in the light of the circumstances then prevailing or under which they were made, as the case may be, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.  The Company will notify you of the time when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement to the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus has been filed.
 
(d)
                                
The Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Notes, in a form approved by the Representatives and contained in Schedule D hereto, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet").
 
(e)
                                 
The Company represents that it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given in respect to the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule C hereto.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives and the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus".  The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
 
(f)
                                   
The Company will advise you, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any proceeding for that purpose having been instituted or threatened by the Commission; and it will promptly use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such a stop order should be issued.
 
(g)
                                
If the Prospectus Delivery Period is ongoing immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives.  If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline.  The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Notes.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall
include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
 
(h)

The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
 
(i)

(j)
                                    
The Company will use its best efforts, at the request of and in cooperation with the Representatives, to qualify the Notes for sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you reasonably designate and to continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes, except that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith to qualify as a foreign corporation or to execute a general consent to service of process in any state.  The Company will also arrange for the determination of the Notes' eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as you reasonably request.

(l)
                                    
The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 15 months after the end of the Company's current fiscal quarter, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) covering a 12-month period beginning after the effective date of the Registration Statement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act.

If the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligation hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the several Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with their investigation, preparing to market and marketing the Notes or in contemplation of performing their obligations hereunder.  The Company shall not in any event be liable to any of the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits from the transactions covered by this Agreement.

Agreements of the Underwriters
.  Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents that it has not made, and covenants and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company, it will not make, any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Company shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule C hereto.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Underwriter must obtain the prior written consent of the Company with respect to the use of a free writing prospectus relating to the Notes that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 of the Act, (b) is not a "free writing prospectus" which includes "issuer information", each as defined in Rule 433 of the Act, or (c) notwithstanding the prior clause (b) of this sentence, contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Notes or their offering, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Notes or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 4(d) hereof.

(e)
                                 
Except as contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement), there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any adverse change, or any development involving a prospective adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the business, net worth or results of operations of the Company from that set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement) that in your judgment makes it impractical or inadvisable to offer or deliver the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
(f)
                                   
The Company shall have furnished to each Representative the opinion of its General Counsel or one of the Associate General Counsel for the Company designated by its General Counsel, dated the Closing Date and, if applicable, the Option Closing Date, to the effect that:
 
(i)
                                    
each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of South Carolina, the jurisdiction in which each is chartered and organized, with the corporate power to own and operate its properties now owned and proposed to be owned by it and conduct its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, in each case as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction which requires such qualification wherein it owns or leases material properties or conducts material business (other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company);
 
(ii)
                                 
to such counsel's knowledge, all the outstanding shares of
c
apital stock of each Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except for the preferred stock of South Carolina Electric & Gas Company and as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries are owned by the Company, either directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries; all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries owned by the Company are held free and clear of any perfected security interest and, to such counsel's knowledge, after due inquiry, any other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances;
(iii)
                              
the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by exceptions customary for such opinions); and the Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered by the Trustee and paid for by the purchasers thereof, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture (except as may be limited by exceptions customary for such opinions);
 
(iv)
                             
there is no pending or, to such counsel's knowledge, threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or the Subsidiaries, of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which is not adequately disclosed therein;
 
(v)
                                
the Company has filed with the Commission a prospectus supplement relating to the Notes pursuant to and within the time period prescribed by the applicable provisions of Rule 424 under the Act.  The Company has filed with the Commission the Final Term Sheet, and any other material used by or provided to the Company that is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings under Rule 433.  The Registration Statement is an automatic shelf registration statement that has become effective under the Act within the last three years, and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment of the Registration Statement is in effect and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to such counsel's knowledge, are pending or contemplated under the Act.  The Registration Statement, as of the Execution Date, the Registration Statement as amended or supplemented by any amendment or further supplement thereto made thereafter by the Company prior to the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date, and the Prospectus, as of its date and the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under such acts (except that such counsel need not express any opinion as to financial statements and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto or as to the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 and, with respect to the Book-Entry Information such counsel may state that its opinion is based solely on information made available by The Depository Trust Company for the purpose of inclusion in the Prospectus);
 
(vi)
                             
this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(vii)
                          
all consents, approvals, authorizations and orders required to be obtained from governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes have been obtained; provided, however, that no opinion need be expressed with regard to state securities laws, or "blue sky" laws, of any jurisdiction;
 
(viii)
                       
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Indenture, the issue and sale of the Notes, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement will (a) violate any applicable law or regulation, (b) conflict with the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (c) breach or result in a default under the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or bound, or (d) violate the terms of any judgment, order or decree known by such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
 
(ix)
                               
the Incorporated Documents (other than the financial statements and other financial or statistical data contained therein, as to which such counsel need not express any opinion), when they were filed with the Commission complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;
 
(x)
                                  
the descriptions in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus of statutes, legal and governmental proceedings, contracts and other documents are, to such counsel's knowledge, accurate and fairly present the information required to be shown therein, and such counsel does not know of any legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which are not described as required, nor of any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or required to be incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described or incorporated by reference or filed as required.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to questions of fact relating to the Company material to such opinion, to the extent deemed proper, on representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and on the statements and certificates of officers and other representatives of the Company and on certificates of public officials, without independent investigation, confirmation or analysis of the underlying data therein and may assume that the laws of the State of South Carolina govern.  Such opinion may be subject to customary assumptions and qualifications applicable to the transaction.
 
Furthermore, in rendering such opinion, but without opining in connection therewith, such counsel shall also state that, based upon such counsel's participation in conferences with representatives of the Company, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that would cause such counsel to believe that (i) any of the Incorporated
 
Documents (other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which such counsel need not express any belief) when they were filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; (ii) either the Registration Statement or any amendments thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or such amendments became effective and as of the Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date or at the Closing Date, or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iv) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need not express any belief as to financial statements and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any amendments or supplements thereto or as to the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 and, with respect to the Book-Entry Information, such counsel's belief may be based solely on information made available by The Depository Trust Company for the purpose of inclusion in the Prospectus).  The foregoing statement shall be provided on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus prior to the date of this Agreement.
 
(g)
                                
The Company shall have furnished to each Representative the opinion of McNair Law Firm, P.A., counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, and, if applicable, the Option Closing Date, to the effect that:
 
(i)
                                    
each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of South Carolina and has the corporate power to own and operate its properties now owned and proposed to be owned by it and conduct its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, in each case as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
 
(ii)
                                 
the Notes and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus;
 
(iii)
                              
the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by exceptions customary to such opinions); and the Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture and delivered by the Trustee and paid for by the purchasers thereof, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture (except as may be limited by exceptions customary to such opinions);
 
(iv)
                             
the Company has filed with the Commission a prospectus supplement relating to the Notes pursuant to and within the time period prescribed by the applicable provisions of Rule 424 under the Act; and the Company has filed with the Commission the Final Term Sheet, and any other material used by or provided to the Company that is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings under Rule 433.  The Registration Statement is an automatic shelf registration statement that has become effective under the Act within the last three years.
  
No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment of the Registration Statement is in effect and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to such counsel's knowledge, are pending
or contemplated
under the Act.  The Registration Statement, as of the Execution Date
,
the Registration Statement as amended or supplemented by any amendment or further supplement thereto made
thereafter
by the Company prior to the Closing Date
, or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date, and the Prospectus, as of its date and the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date
, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under such acts (except that such counsel need not express any opinion as to financial statements and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto or as to the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 and, with respect to the Book-Entry Information, such counsel may state that its opinion is based solely on information made available by The Depository Trust Company for the purpose of inclusion in the Prospectus);
 
(v)
                                
the statements contained in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the captions "Specific Terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes," "Certain Terms of the Replacement Capital Covenant" and "Description of the
Junior Subordinated Notes," insofar as such statements purport to be descriptions or summaries of the Notes, the Indenture or the Replacement Capital Covenant, fairly present the matters purported to be shown therein;
 
(vi)
                             
the Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company" subject to registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
 
(vii)
                          
all consents, approvals, authorizations and orders required to be obtained from governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes have been obtained; provided, however, that no
opinion need be expressed with regard to state securities laws, or "blue sky" laws, of any jurisdiction;
 
(viii)
                       
this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
(ix)
                               
with regard to the discussion in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations," subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, such counsel is of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion does not purport to disclose all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes, such discussion constitutes an accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects; and
 
(x)
                                  
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Indenture, the issue and sale of the Notes, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement violate (a) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, (b) the provisions of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or (c) any agreement or instrument filed or referenced in Exhibits 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05 and 10.12 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to questions of fact relating to the Company material to such opinion, to the extent deemed proper, on representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and on the statements and certificates of officers and other representatives of the Company and on certificates of public officials, without independent investigation, confirmation or analysis of the underlying data therein and may assume that the laws of the State of South Carolina govern.  Such opinion may be subject to customary assumptions and qualifications applicable to the transaction.
 
Furthermore, in rendering such opinion, but without opining in connection therewith, such counsel shall also state that, based upon its participation in conferences with representatives of the Company and the Company's accountants and participation in certain prior financings of the Company, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that would cause it to believe that (i) any of the Incorporated Documents (other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which such counsel need not express any belief), when they were filed with the Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; (ii) either the Registration Statement or any amendments thereto, at the time the Registration Statement or such amendments became effective and as of the Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date or the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading; or (iv) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that such counsel need not express any belief as to financial statements and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any amendments or supplements thereto or as to the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 and, with respect to the Book-Entry Information, such counsel's belief may be based on information made available by The Depository Trust Company for the purpose of inclusion in the Prospectus).  The foregoing statement shall be provided on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus prior to the date of this Agreement.
 
(h)

In rendering its opinion, such counsel may rely upon the opinion referred to in Section 5(f) above as to all matters governed by South Carolina law.

the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects upon and as of the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Option Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied as a condition to the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Notes;
 
(ii)
                                 
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened;

Indemnification and Contribution
.
 
(a)
                                 
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers, agents and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter, director, officer, agent or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto,
including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter, director, officer, agent or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you, or by any Underwriter through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b)
                                
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,  in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you, or by such Underwriter through you, specifically for use in the preparation thereof; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so
to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (2) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (3) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (4) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties.  It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties.  All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred.  An indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 6 (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable under subsection (a) or (b) above to a party that would have been an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above ("Indemnified Party") in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each party that would have been an indemnifying party thereunder ("Indemnifying Party") shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the
Notes.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the Indemnified Party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus which is filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act referred to in Section 2(a) hereof.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in subsection (c) above if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts received by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
                                 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director, officer, and agent of an Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

Substitution of Underwriters
.
 
(a)
                                 
If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail to take up and pay for the principal amount of Firm Notes or Option Notes agreed by such Underwriter or Underwriters to be purchased hereunder, upon tender of such Firm Notes or Option Notes in accordance with the terms hereof, and the principal amount of Firm Notes or Option Notes not purchased does not aggregate more than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Notes or Option Notes, as applicable, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated to take up and pay for (in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder except as may otherwise be determined by you) the Firm Notes or Option Notes which any withdrawing or defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; however, if such Firm Notes or Option Notes not purchased aggregate more than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Notes or Option Notes, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to take up and pay for (in such proportions as shall be determined by you) the Firm Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase.  If such remaining Underwriters do not, at the Closing Date or Option Closing Date, as applicable, take up and pay for the Firm Notes or Option Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase, the time for delivery of the Firm Notes or Option Notes shall be extended to the next business day to allow the several Underwriters the privilege of substituting within 24 hours (including non-business hours) another underwriter or underwriters satisfactory to the Company.  If no such underwriter or underwriters shall have been substituted, as aforesaid, the time for delivery of the Firm Notes or Option Notes, as applicable, may, at the option of the Company, be again extended to the next following business day, if necessary, to allow the Company the privilege of finding within 24 hours (including non-business hours) another underwriter or underwriters, satisfactory to you, to purchase the Firm Notes or Option Notes, as applicable, which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase.  If the remaining Underwriters shall not take up and pay for all such Firm Notes or Option Notes agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriters, or substitute another underwriter or underwriters as aforesaid, and the Company shall not find or shall not elect to seek another underwriter or underwriters for such Firm Notes or Option Notes as aforesaid, then this Agreement shall terminate.  In the event of any such termination the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter (except to the extent provided in Section 4(n) and in Section 6 hereof), nor shall any Underwriter (other than an Underwriter who shall have failed, otherwise than for some reason permitted under this Agreement, to purchase the principal amount of Firm Notes or Option Notes agreed by such Underwriter to be purchased hereunder) be under any liability to the Company (except to the extent provided in Section 6 hereof).
 
(b)
                                
If the remaining Underwriters or substituted underwriters take up the Firm Notes or Option Notes of the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters as provided in this Section, (i) the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of delivery for a period of not more than seven full business days, in order to effect any changes which may be made necessary thereby in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees promptly to file any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which may be made necessary thereby, and (ii) the respective principal amounts of Firm Notes or Option Notes to be purchased by the remaining Underwriters or substituted underwriters shall be taken as the basis of their respective underwriting
obligations for all purposes of this Agreement.  A substituted underwriter hereunder shall become an Underwriter for all purposes of this Agreement.
 
(c)
                                 
Nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility

The final maturity date of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be no later than January 30, 2080, on which date the entire principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes will become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. The "Stated Maturity" of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall mean the maturity date of the Junior Subordinated Notes as extended in accordance with this Section 2.2, which may not be otherwise shortened or extended.
 
With respect to each extension beginning on January 30, 2020, the following shall constitute the extension conditions:
 
(a)         On the applicable extension date the ratings on the Junior Subordinated Notes satisfy at least two of the three following ratings criteria: (i) at least Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's"), (ii) at least BBB- by Standard & Poors Ratings Services ("Standard & Poor's") and (iii) at least BBB- by Fitch Ratings Ltd ("Fitch"), or, if Moody's, Standard & Poor's and/or Fitch (or their respective successors) are no longer in existence, the equivalent rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; and

2.3 Form and Payment; Minimum Transfer Restriction.
 
(a)         
The Junior Subordinated Notes shall be issued in fully registered definitive form without coupons in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. Principal and interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will be payable, the transfer of such Junior Subordinated Notes will be registrable and such Junior Subordinated Notes will be exchangeable for Junior Subordinated Notes bearing identical terms and provisions at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at such address as shall appear in the Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Register, provided that proper transfer instructions have been received by the Paying Agent by the Record Date. The Register for the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Trustee is hereby appointed registrar and Paying Agent for the Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
(b)        
The Junior Subordinated Notes may be transferred or exchanged only in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof, and any attempted transfer, sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes in a denomination of less than $25 shall be deemed to be void and of no legal effect whatsoever. Any such transferee shall be deemed not to be the holder of such Junior Subordinated Notes for any purpose, including but not limited to the receipt of payments in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes and such transferee shall be
deemed to have no interest whatsoever in such Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
(c)         
Pursuant to the Base Indenture, the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as registrar and "Paying Agent" with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
2.4 Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Junior Subordinated Notes; Restrictions on Transfers; Depositary.
 
The Junior Subordinated Notes will be issued to the holders in accordance with the following procedures:
 
(a)         
So long as Junior Subordinated Notes are eligible for book-entry settlement with the Depositary, or unless required by law, all
Junior Subordinated Notes that are so eligible will be represented by one or more Junior Subordinated Notes in global form (a "Global Note") registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary. Except as provided in Section 2.4(c) below, beneficial owners of a Global Note shall not be entitled to have Definitive Note Certificates registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Definitive Note Certificates and will not be registered holders of such Global Notes.
 
The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in Global Notes shall be effected through the Depositary in accordance with the Indenture and the procedures and standing instructions of the Depositary and the Trustee shall make appropriate endorsements to reflect increases or decreases in principal amounts of such Global Notes.  In addition, all payments of principal and purchase price of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on the Global Notes and all notices, communications and other documents required to be mailed to the holders with respect to the Global Notes or pursuant to the Indenture, shall be made and given at the times and in accordance with the procedures and standing instructions of the Depositary (which procedures and standing instructions shall govern in the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Indenture and such procedures and standing instructions).
(b)        
 
(c)         
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in this Section 2.4(c)), a Global Note may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Junior Subordinated Notes registered, and no transfer of a Global Note may be registered, in the name of any person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof unless (i) such Depositary (A) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Note or (B) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Exchange Act and no successor Depositary has been appointed by the Company within 90 days after its receipt of such notice or its becoming aware of such ineligibility, (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, or any event which after notice or lapse of time or both would be an Event of Default under the Indenture, with respect to such Junior Subordinated Note, or (iii) the Company, in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depositary, instructs the Trustee to exchange such Global Note for a Junior Subordinated Note that is not a Global Note (in which case such exchange (subject to such procedures) shall be effected by the Trustee).
 
The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act. The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes. Initially, the Global Notes shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the
nominee of the Depositary, and deposited with the Trustee as custodian for Cede & Co.
 
Definitive Note Certificates issued in exchange for all or a part of a Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Trustee shall deliver such Definitive Note Certificates to the person in whose names such Definitive Note Certificates are so registered.
 
purposes of the Indenture relating to such Global Notes as the sole holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes evidenced by such Global Notes and shall have no obligations to the holders of beneficial interests in such Global Notes; and (ii) the rights of the holders of beneficial interests in such Global Notes shall be exercised only through the Depository and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such holders and the Depository and/or the participants in the Depository.
So long as Junior Subordinated Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes, (i) the registrar for the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Depository for all
 
At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been paid, redeemed, exchanged, repurchased or canceled, such Global Note shall be, upon receipt thereof, canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and instructions of the Depositary. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for Definitive Note Certificates, redeemed by the Company pursuant to Article II or canceled, or transferred for part of a Global Note, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions of the Depositary be reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by, or at the direction of, the Trustee to reflect such reduction or increase.
 
2.5 Interest.
 
(a)         
Each Junior Subordinated Note will bear interest at the rate of 7.70% per annum from the Original Issue Date. Subject to the Company's right to defer interest payments described in Article IV below, interest is payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. If interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid, they will accrue and compound until paid at the annual rate of 7.70% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable will be paid to the Person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note is registered, at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided that interest payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for, and that is not deferred pursuant to Article IV hereof, will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Record Date and may either be paid (i) to the Person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note (or any Junior Subordinated Note issued upon registration of transfer or exchange thereof) is registered at the close of business on the record date for the payment of such defaulted interest established in accordance with Section 2.3 of the Base Indenture or (ii) at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of the securities exchange, if any, on which the Junior Subordinated Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange. The "Record Date" for
payment of interest will be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, unless such Junior Subordinated Note is registered to a holder other than the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary, in which case the Record Date for payment of interest will be the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.
 
principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable.
(b)        
If an Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and
 
An Event of Default as defined in the Indenture shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes provided that the nonpayment of interest for so long as and to the extent that interest is permitted to be deferred pursuant to Article IV herein shall not be deemed to be a default in the payment of interest for the purposes of Article VI of the Base Indenture and shall not otherwise be deemed an Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be an Event of Default except those that are specifically identified as an Event of Default under the Indenture.
2.6 Events of Default.
 
The Company shall have the option to redeem the Junior Subordinated Notes:
3.1 Optional Redemption by Company.

(b)        
 
in whole, but not in part, at any time before January 30, 2015, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but not including, the redemption date; and
(c)         
 
in whole or in part at any time on or after January 30, 2015, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but not including, the redemption date.

sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date such redemption price is to be paid. The Company will notify the Trustee of the amount of any applicable Make-Whole Amount or Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Amount promptly after the calculation thereof, and the Trustee will not be responsible for such calculation.
 
Subject to Article III of the Base Indenture, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Article III will be mailed at least 20 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed at such holder's registered address. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the applicable redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest shall cease to accrue on such Junior Subordinated Notes called for redemption.

So long as there is no Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes under the Base Indenture, the Company, at its option, may, on one or more occasions, defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on the Junior Subordinated Notes for a period of up to ten consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise have been made, an "Optional Deferral Period"). A deferral of interest payments may not end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date and may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period and may not pay current interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes until it has paid allaccrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period. Such accrued interest shall be payable to the persons in whose names the Junior Subordinated Notes are registered at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

Any deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to 7.70% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once the Company pays all deferred interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, including any Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, it shall be entitled to again defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes as described above, but not beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes.

Unless the Company has paid all
 
declare or pay any dividends or distributions, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment on any of the Company's Capital Stock;
(i)
                                  
 
make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any of its debt securities that rank on a parity with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes (including debt securities of other series issued under the Base Indenture); or
(ii)
                               
 
make any guarantee payments on any guarantee of debt securities if the guarantee
(iii)
                            
ranks on a parity with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
However, the foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Company from making:
 
(a)           purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, agents or consultants or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its Capital Stock;
 
any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clause (i) above as a result of a reclassification of its Capital Stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its Capital Stock for another class or series of its Capital Stock;
(b)          
 
(c)          
the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
 
(d)          
dividends or distributions paid or made in its Capital Stock (or rights to acquire its Capital Stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of Capital Stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of Capital Stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Capital Stock) and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
 
(e)          
redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; or
 
(f)           
payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, any trust preferred securities, subordinated debentures, junior subordinated debentures or junior subordinated notes, or any guarantees of any of the foregoing, in each case that rank equal in right of payment to the Junior Subordinated Notes, so long as the amount of payments made on account of such securities or guarantees is paid on all such securities and guarantees then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of such securities and guarantees is then entitled if paid in full.
 
The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of its election to begin an Optional Deferral Period at least one Business Day before the Record Date for the next Interest Payment Date. The Trustee will forward any written notice that the Company gives of its election to begin an Optional Deferral Period to the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes. However, the Company's failure to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date will itself constitute the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period unless the Company pays such interest payment within five Business Days after the Interest Payment Date, whether or not the

SCANA CORPORATION, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of South Carolina (herein referred to as the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Holder named above, the principal sum [of Dollars]** [specified in the Schedule annexed hereto]*** on the date of Stated Maturity, as hereafter defined, and to pay (subject to deferral as set forth herein) interest thereon at the rate of 7.70% per annum, such interest to accrue from November     , 2009. Subject to the Company's right to defer interest payments described herein, interest is payable quarterly in arrears on each January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30, commencing on January 30, 2010 (the "Interest Payment Dates"), until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. If interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid, they will accrue and compound until paid at the annual rate of 7.70% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
 
The maturity date of this note (this "Note") initially will be January 30, 2065, but will be automatically extended, except for any portion of the principal amount of this Note that shall have been earlier redeemed or with respect to which notice of redemption shall have been given to the Holder (as defined herein) hereof, for additional quarterly periods on each of January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30, beginning on January 30, 2015, through and including October 30, 2019, without notice to, or consent of, the Holder of this Note. Subject to the conditions described below, the maturity date will be further automatically extended for additional quarterly periods beginning on January 30, 2020, through and including October 30, 2029, except for any portion of the principal amount of this Note that shall have been earlier redeemed or with respect to which notice of redemption shall have been given to the Holder hereof. The final maturity date of this Note will be no later than January 30, 2080, on which date the entire principal amount of this Note
will become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. The Stated Maturity of this Note shall mean the maturity date of this Note as extended in accordance with this paragraph, and may not be otherwise shortened or extended.
 
With respect to each extension beginning on January 30, 2020, the following shall constitute the extension conditions:
 
On the applicable extension date the ratings on the Junior Subordinated Notes satisfy at least two of the three following ratings criteria: (i) at least Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's"), (ii) at least BBB- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("Standard & Poor's") and (iii) at least BBB- by Fitch Ratings Ltd ("Fitch"), or, if Moody's, Standard & Poor's and/or Fitch (or their respective successors) are no longer in existence, the equivalent rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; and
(a)         
During the three years prior to the applicable extension date:
(b)
                         
 
no event of default has occurred in respect of any of the Company's then outstanding indebtedness for money borrowed; and
(i)           
 
the Company did not have (and does not have at the extension date) any outstanding deferred payments under any of its then-outstanding preferred stock or debt securities.
(ii)          
 
The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable on an Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered, at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided that interest payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for, and that is not deferred as described below, will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Record Date and may either be paid (i) to the Person in whose name this Note (or any Junior Subordinated Note issued upon registration of transfer or exchange thereof) is registered at the close of business on the record date for the payment of such defaulted interest established in accordance with Section 2.3 of the Base Indenture or (ii) at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of the securities exchange, if any, on which the Junior Subordinated Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange. The "Record Date" for payment of interest will be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, unless this Note is registered to a holder other than the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary, in which case the Record Date for payment of interest will be the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.
 
If an Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable.
 
This Note may be presented for payment of principal and interest at the office of the Paying Agent, in the City of St. Paul, State of Minnesota; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company (i) by check mailed to such address of the person entitled thereto as the address shall appear on the Register of the Notes or (ii) by transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Register, provided that proper transfer instructions have been received by the Record Date. Payment of the principal and interest on this Note shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
 
So long as there is no Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes under the Base Indenture, the Company, at its option, may, on one or more occasions, defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on the Junior Subordinated Notes for a period of up to ten consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise have been made, an "Optional Deferral Period"). A deferral of
interest payments may not end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date and may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period and may not pay current interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes until it has paid all accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period. Such accrued interest shall be payable to the persons in whose names the Junior Subordinated Notes are registered at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
Any deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to 7.70% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once the Company pays all deferred interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, including any Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, it shall be entitled to again defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes as described above, but not beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
Unless the Company has paid all accrued and payable interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes and is not deferring any interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes at such time, it will not and its Subsidiaries shall not do any of the following:
 
declare or pay any dividends or distributions, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment on any of SCANA Corporation's Capital Stock;
(i)         
 
make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any of its debt securities that rank on a parity with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes (including debt securities of other series issued under the Base Indenture); or
(ii)        
 
make any guarantee payments on any guarantee of debt securities if the guarantee ranks on a parity with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes.
(iii)       
 
However, the foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Company from making:
 
(a)         
purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, agents or consultants or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its Capital Stock;
 
(b)        
any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clause (i) above as a result of a reclassification of its Capital Stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its Capital Stock for another class or series of its Capital Stock;
 
(c)         
the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
(d)        
dividends or distributions paid or made in its Capital Stock (or rights to acquire its Capital Stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of Capital Stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of Capital Stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Capital Stock) and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
 
(e)         
redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; or
 
(f)         
payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, any trust preferred securities, subordinated debentures, junior subordinated debentures or junior subordinated notes, or any guarantees of any of the foregoing, in each case that rank equal in right of payment to the Junior Subordinated Notes, so long as the amount of payments made on account of such securities or guarantees is paid on all such securities and guarantees then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of such securities and guarantees is then entitled if paid in full.
 
The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of its election to begin a deferral period at least one Business Day before the Record Date for the next Interest Payment Date. The Trustee will forward any written notice that the Company gives of its election to begin a deferral period to the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes. However, the Company's failure to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date will itself constitute the commencement of a deferral period unless the Company pays such interest payment within five Business Days after the Interest Payment Date, whether or not the Company provides a notice of deferral.
 
The Notes of this series shall have an initial aggregate principal amount of up to One Hundred Fifty Million and no/100 Dollars ($150,000,000).
 
The Notes evidenced by this Certificate may be transferred or exchanged only in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof, and any attempted transfer, sale or other disposition of Notes in a denomination of less than $25 shall be deemed to be void and of no legal effect whatsoever.
 
The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Note, including the principal hereof and interest hereon is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations to holders of Priority Indebtedness of the Company and each Holder of this Note, by acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture and all other provisions of the Indenture.
 
This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, SCANA CORPORATION has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee"), and as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 1, 2009, by and among the Company and the Trustee (collectively, as amended or supplemented through the date hereof and from time to time, herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders (the word "Holder" or "Holders" meaning the registered holder or registered holders) of the Notes. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof (the "Junior Subordinated Notes") which is unlimited in aggregate principal amount.

(d)
          
vendor, as the case may be; and (v) promptly upon the request of any Holder of Covered Debt, the Corporation will provide such Holder with an executed copy of this Replacement Capital Covenant.
 
SECTION 4.
Termination and Amendment.
 
The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the "Termination Date") to occur of (i) (x) January 30, 2035 or (y) if the maturity date of the Notes shall be extended in accordance with the First Supplemental Indenture, the date which is 30 years prior to the maturity date, as extended, or if earlier, the date on which the Notes are otherwise paid, redeemed, defeased or purchased in full (in compliance with the terms of Section 2 of this Replacement Capital Covenant), (ii) the date, if any, on which the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the then effective Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (iii) the date on which the Corporation ceases to have any Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (ii) of the definition of each such term), or (iv) the date on which the Notes are accelerated as a result of a default thereunder. From and after the Termination Date, the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be of no further force and effect with respect to the Holders, or otherwise.
(a)
          
 
This Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Corporation after obtaining the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the then-effective Covered Debt; provided that this Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed by the Corporation (and without the consent of the Holders) if any of the following apply: (i) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, Rights to acquire Common Stock, Common Equity Units and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities, if, in the case of this clause, after the date of this Replacement Capital Covenant, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that, or the Corporation has been otherwise advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that, there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Stock, Rights to acquire Common Stock, Common Equity Units and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") if then applicable to the Corporation; (ii) the sole effect of such amendment or supplement is either (A) to impose additional restrictions on the ability of (1) the Corporation to redeem, purchase or defease Notes or (2) any majority-owned Subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase Notes, or (B) to impose additional restrictions on, or to eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities (other than securities which are covered by clause (i) above) and in each case an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture or other instrument under which such Covered Debt was issued a written certificate to that effect; (iii) such amendment or supplement extends the date specified in Section 4(a)(i), the Stepdown Date or both; or (iv) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the rights of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt and
(b)
          
an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture or other instrument under which such Covered Debt was issued a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the rights of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of Replacement Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of the Replacement Capital Securities described herein would not be adverse to the rights of the Holders of the Covered Debt if, following such amendment or supplement, this Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy the definition of Explicit Replacement Covenant.
 
For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement this Replacement Capital Covenant or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder shall be the Holders of the then effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
(c)
          
 
SECTION 5.
Miscellaneous.
 
This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
(a)
          
 
This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be binding upon the Corporation (and its successors and assigns) and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Debtholders as they exist from time-to-time (it being understood and agreed by the Corporation that any Person who is a Covered Debtholder shall retain its status as a Covered Debtholder for so long as the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money owned by such Person is Covered Debt and, if such Person initiates a claim or proceeding to enforce its rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant after the Corporation has violated its covenants in Section 2 and before the series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed held by such Person is no longer Covered Debt, such Person's rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall not terminate by reason of such series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed no longer being Covered Debt). The Corporation agrees that, if at any time the Covered Debt is held by a trust (for example, where the Covered Debt is part of an issuance of trust preferred securities), a holder of the securities issued by such trust may enforce (including by instituting legal proceedings) this Replacement Capital Covenant directly against the Corporation as though such holder owned the Covered Debt directly, and the holders of such trust securities shall be deemed Holders of the Covered Debt for purposes of this Replacement Capital Covenant for so long as the indebtedness held by such trust remains the Covered Debt hereunder. Other than the Covered Debtholders as provided in the two previous sentences, no other Person shall have any rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant or be deemed a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant. In particular, no holder of the Notes is a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant, it being understood that such holders may have rights under the Base Indenture.
(b)
          
 
The Corporation acknowledges that reliance by each Covered Debtholder upon the covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant is reasonable and foreseeable by the Corporation and that, were the Corporation to disregard its covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant, each Covered Debtholder would have sustained an injury as a result of its reliance on such covenants.
(c)
          
 
All demands, notices, requests and other communications to the Corporation
(d)
          
under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if in writing and (i) if served by personal delivery upon the Corporation, on the day so delivered (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) or (ii) if delivered by registered post or certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent to the Corporation by a national or international courier service, on the date of receipt by the Corporation (or, if such date of receipt is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), or (iii) if sent by telecopier, on the day telecopied, or if not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, provided that the telecopy is promptly confirmed by telephone confirmation thereof, and in each case to the Corporation at the address set forth below, or at such other address as the Corporation may thereafter post on its website as the address for notices under this Replacement Capital Covenant:

(e)
          
 
in the case of Qualifying Capital Securities include a Bankruptcy Claim Limitation Provision; and
(f)
           
 
permit such issuer, at its option, to provide that if such issuer is involved in a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, statutory share exchange, conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets to any other person or a similar transaction (a "business combination") where immediately after the consummation of the business combination more than 50% of the surviving or resulting entity's voting securities is owned by the equity holders of the other party to the business combination, or the entity to whom all or substantially all of such issuer's assets are conveyed, leased or otherwise transferred, then clauses (a), (b) and (c) above will not apply to any deferral period that is terminated on the next Distribution Date following the date of consummation of the business combination;
(g)
          
 
provided (and it being understood) that:
 
the Alternative Payment Mechanism may at the discretion of such issuer include a share cap limiting the issuance of APM Qualifying Securities consisting of Common Stock, Qualifying Warrants and Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case to a maximum issuance cap to be set at the discretion of such issuer (a "Share Cap"); provided that such Share Cap will be subject to such issuer's agreement to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to increase the Share Cap when reached and (i) only to the extent it can do so and simultaneously satisfy its future fixed or contingent obligations under other securities and derivative instruments
(h)

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel for the several underwriters (as defined below) in connection with the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-163075) (the "Registration Statement") filed by SCANA Corporation, a South Carolina corporation (the "Company"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Underwriting Agreement, dated November 17, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), under which the Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2009 Series A 7.70% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes (the "Notes").  The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of a junior subordinated indenture dated as of November 1, 2009 (the "Base Indenture") to be entered into between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of November 1, 2009 to be entered into between the Company and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), forms of which have been filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement.
 
This opinion is delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of: (1) the form of Base Indenture and (2) the form of Supplemental Indenture.  We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
 
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, electronic, or facsimile copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents.  In making our examination of executed documents or documents which may be executed, we have assumed that the parties thereto had or will have the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by the Company and the other parties thereto, of such documents and that (except to the extent we have opined on such matters below) such documents constitute or will constitute valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto.  We have also assumed that the Base Indenture and Supplemental Indenture will be executed and delivered in substantially the forms reviewed by us.  Additionally, we have assumed that the choice of New York law that will govern each of the Base Indenture and Supplemental Indenture will be a valid and binding provision.  As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that we have not independently established or verified, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.  We have also assumed that (1) the Registration Statement, as finally amended (including all necessary post-effective amendments), has become and remains effective under the Securities Act, an appropriate amended prospectus or prospectus supplement with respect to the Notes has been prepared, delivered, and filed in compliance with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder; (2) the Notes are in accordance with the terms of their governing instruments; and (3) the Underwriting Agreement with respect to the Notes has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by the Company and the other parties thereto, and is a valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto.
 
Our opinion set forth below is limited to the laws of the State of New York.  Our opinion is also limited to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings, or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws in the foregoing jurisdictions.  We do not express any opinion with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction.  This opinion is limited to the laws, including the rules and regulations, as in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.  As to all matters of South Carolina law, we have relied, with your consent, upon the opinion of Ronald T. Lindsay, Esquire, General Counsel of the Company, addressed to you of even date herewith.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the limitations, qualifications, exceptions, and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that when the Notes have been duly executed, countersigned, authenticated, issued, and delivered in accordance with the Indenture to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed-upon consideration therefor in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement or the prospectus supplement relating thereto and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by all parties thereto, the Notes will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
 
accordance with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), (iii) public policy considerations that may limit the rights of the parties to obtain further remedies, and (iv) the waiver of any usury defense that may be contained in the Indenture that may be unenforceable.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company on or about November 23, 2009, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.  This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the facts stated or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in applicable law.
 
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Notes from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent, except that
Ronald T. Lindsay, Esquire, General Counsel of the Company
, may rely upon this opinion in rendering his opinion as to the validity and binding effect of the Notes.

SCANA Corporation
Cayce, South Carolina
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to SCANA Corporation, a South Carolina corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement filed on November 12, 2009 (the "Registration Statement"), and the Prospectus Supplement dated November 17, 2009 (the "Offering Documents"), for the purpose of offering $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2009 Series A 7.70% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") due January 30, 2065, subject to extensions to no later than January 30, 2080.
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined the forms of Junior Subordinated Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture to the foregoing, each dated as of November 1, 2009, and the form of Note, each to be entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Offering Documents and such other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinion.
 
In our examination, we have assumed that (i) the statements concerning the issuance of the Notes contained in the Offering Documents are true, correct and complete, (ii) the terms of the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph will be complied with, (iii) the factual representations made to us by the Company in its officer's certificate dated as of the date hereof and delivered to us for purposes of this opinion (the "Officer's Certificate") are true, correct and complete, and (iv) any factual representations made in the Offering Documents or the Officer's Certificate to the best knowledge of, in the belief of, or similarly qualified are true, correct and complete without such qualification.  If any of the above described assumptions are untrue for any reason or if the issuance of the Notes is consummated in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner in which it is described in the Offering Documents, our opinion as expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.
 
Subject to and based solely upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that (1) the Notes will be treated as indebtedness of the Company for United States federal income tax purposes (although there is no controlling authority directly on point) and (2) insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax law, the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading
 
 
"Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" is a fair and accurate summary of the matters discussed therein.
 
Our opinion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Regulations (including temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations) issued thereunder, Internal Revenue Service rulings and pronouncements and judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.  Our opinion is limited to the matters expressly stated herein.  Our opinion is rendered only as of the date hereof, and its validity could be affected by subsequent changes in applicable law.  We have not undertaken to advise you or any other person with respect to any such change subsequent to the date hereof.  An opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court would not take a contrary position with respect to any of the conclusions contained herein.
 
We are rendering this opinion to you solely in connection with the offering of the Notes, and this opinion is not to be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company on the date hereof, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  In giving the foregoing consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.
