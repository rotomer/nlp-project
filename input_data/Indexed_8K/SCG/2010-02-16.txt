Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company ("SCE&G" or "Company") to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the "Commission") and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff ("ORS").  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2009) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104A.  The report provides updated information concerning the status of construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station Units 2 & 3 (the "Units") and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units as approved in Order No. 2009-104A.  Order No. 2009-104A is the base load review order related to the Units that was issued by the Commission on February 27, 2009.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules and construction milestone schedules for the Units in Order No. 2010-12.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104A.  There are 146 separate milestones. Of these, 44 have been completed as of December 31, 2009.  Since the last quarterly report, the expected quarterly completion dates of 23 milestones have changed.  Of these, 18 have been accelerated and five (5) have been delayed for between one and five months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
As this report indicates, the Company is on track to complete the Units at the construction cost forecast of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars, net of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC"), as approved in Order No. 2009-104A.
 
In Order No. 2009-104A, the Commission recognized that forecasts of AFUDC expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  As below shows the forecasted construction cost for the project in 2007 dollars is unchanged.  An increase in the AFUDC rate ($53.3 million) which is partially offset by a reduction in escalation rates ($17.3 million) has increased the gross construction cost forecast of the units by $36 million or 0.6% compared to the forecast provided in the quarterly report for the quarter ending September 30, 2009.
Chart A
 
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including escalation and AFUDC, to the forecast presented by the Company in Docket 2009-293-E.  This chart shows that, while the cost of the plant in 2007 dollars remains at the approved $4.5 billion level, the gross construction cost including escalation and AFUDC is $576 million below the revised schedule forecast.  The reduction in the construction cost forecast is due to the changes in forecasted escalation when netted against other changes as discussed more fully below.
E.
                                     
Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104A, the most current 12-month inflation indices are used to project costs occurring in the 12 month period after the date of each quarterly report.  Five-year average rates are used to project costs more than 12 months beyond the date of each report.  As a result, with each quarterly filing, the costs for one quarter shift from being forecasted using the five-year indices to being forecasted using the 12-month indices.
 
As shown on , utility construction costs were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have begun to drop.  Current escalation rates are at historical lows.  However, the current five-year averages are now closer to historical rates than they were in past periods.  Current escalation rates are shown on , below.
Appendix 4
Chart C
 
 
 
 
For supplemental analysis purposes, the Company has recomputed project cash flow, net of AFUDC, using both the one-year escalation rates and ten-year escalation rates.  As shown on below, the use of the ten-year rates generates results that are much more comparable to the results generated using five-year rates than was the case in past periods.  Use of one-year rates over the long-term generates cost projections that appear unreasonably low.

Increased AFUDC
 
The change in AFUDC for the project is currently projected at $17.6 million compared to the forecast contained in Docket 2009-293-E.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104A, SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress ("CWIP") that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's AFUDC rate is currently 7.10% compared to the rate of 5.87% that applied in Docket 2009-293-E.  Standing alone, this increase in the AFUDC rate would increase the forecasted amount of AFUDC by $55.2 million. However, lower escalation rates have reduced the forecasted project cash flows thereby reducing AFUDC by $37.6 million to produce a $17.6 million net forecasted increase in AFUDC for the project.

Contingency Usage and Availability
 
As below indicates, $1.1 million of the total project contingency of $438 million in 2007 dollars was spent during the current period.  No contingency had been used in prior reporting periods.  As discussed in more detail below, this $1.1 million reflects additional costs in 2009 associated with Change Order No. 2 for the project, and the recalculation of owner's costs.  The $1.1 million in contingency used in 2009 represents approximately 2.9% of the total 2009 contingency pool of $37.9 million and approximately 0.25% of the total contingency pool for the project of $438 million.
Table E
 
 
 
As shown in more detail on , and as discussed below, SCE&G currently forecasts that at the close of 2018 it will have used a cumulative total of $67.5 million of the $438 million contingency fund, in current dollars, to cover the increased escalation costs associated with project schedule changes and changes in base costs for the project.  Of this $67.5 million amount, $64.2 million represents forecasted changes in base costs for the project and the remaining $3.3 million represents forecasted changes related to escalation as a result of shifts in the timing of expenses.  The $64.2 million in contingency funds currently forecasted to be used to cover increases in base costs of the project represent approximately 1.4% of the total unescalated project cost.

Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
Order No. 2009-104A established the Cumulative Project Cash Flow, listed on Exhibit F to the Combined Application, as the target for measuring the compliance of the project with the cost-related terms of that order.  Order No. 2010-12 updated Exhibit F to
conform to the Performance Management Baseline Schedule provided by Westinghouse/Shaw on April 1, 2009.  Order No. 2009-104A provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data and any use by the Company of the cost-related contingencies that the Commission approved in Order No. 2009-104A.
 
Appendix 2, Chart A
provides the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data as of December 31, 2009 and the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project.  The cash flow data for the last six months of 2009 are based on the most recently available inflation indices which for purposes of this report are indices that are current through June 30, 2009.  When actual indices for the period June 30, 2009-December 31, 2009 become available, the 2009 cash flow data for the categories that are subject to indexed escalation will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2, Chart B
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  , shows that after all adjustments discussed in this report the project ended 2009 on budget, with a minimal surplus of approximately $64,000 due to timing differences in costs.  In addition, the figures presented on and for 2009 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order 2009-104A.  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, Westinghouse/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments in the following year to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  The effect of the adjustment made to is to offset this timing difference related to Westinghouse/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits.  The adjustment applies only to amounts billed to the project during the last six months of 2009 in those EPC cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.  As shown on the total amount of the resulting adjustment for 2009 was $9.7 million.  The 2009 expenditure number also reflects the carry-forward of $6 million of costs that were unspent in 2009 but are expected to be spent in future years.

Appendix 2, Chart B
shows that due to the effects of timing, the project cash flow in the period 2010-2018 will vary within a range of $12.8 million above to $12.5 million below target in each year.  As shown on the cumulative use of contingency to cover changes in escalation due to these timing variances is $3.3 million over the life of the project.  In no year does the cumulative use of contingency to cover timing differences exceed $23 million.  The current forecast also shows that the total use of contingency to cover both escalation-related costs increases and changes in base cost estimates will be $67.5 million or 1.5% of the total project commitment.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Construction of the project is progressing on schedule to meet the Unit 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates of April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  A summary of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.
 
A.
                                   
Licensing and Permitting Update
 
1.
                                     
The Combined Operating License Application (COLA)
 
The COLA review process continues.  The current construction schedule is based on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issuing a Combined Operating License (COL) for the Units no later than July 1, 2011.  Westinghouse (WEC) is expected to submit the shield building technical report to the NRC and to complete testing of the new design for that building in the next 45-60 days.  As mentioned in the prior quarterly report, after the test results are accepted by the NRC, Westinghouse intends to file with the NRC a Design Control Document (DCD) revision, DCD Revision 18. DCD Revision18 will incorporate all of the responses to NRC questions and all of the updates to design matters that have been requested as part of the COLA review process and that are not part of prior amendments.  In light of its assessment of the anticipated schedule for review and approval of DCD Revision 18, SCE&G currently believes that the COL for Units 2 & 3 will be issued in late 2011 or early 2012.  This schedule for the issuance of the COL would impact certain aspects of the construction schedule for the Units.  However, SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw do not believe that a COL issuance date of late 2011 or early 2012 will adversly impact the scheduled Substantial Completion dates of Unit 2 or of Unit 3.  SCE&G will continue to carefully monitor and proactively manage this aspect of the COL schedule.  As the schedule for the filing and approval of DCD Revision 18 become better known, SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw will make any required revisions to the construction schedule to reflect the anticipated issuance date of the COL. SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw are evaluating steps that could be taken to accelerate construction if necessary and are confident that any delay in the issuance of the COL will not necessarily delay the Substantial Completion dates of the Units.  The status of the major COLA review areas is as follows:
a)
                                     
Nuclear Safety Review
 
1)
                                    
The Staff of the NRC has completed its Phase 1 review to support development of the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the Units, which includes the COLA review and issuance of NRC Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) to SCE&G for resolution. During the Phase 2 review, SCE&G will continue to respond to NRC questions that may arise.  The Phase 2 review of the SER is intended to result in the development of the SER with no open items.
 
The NRC continues the SER review for the WEC DCD Revision 17 and continues dialogue with WEC in an effort to resolve NRC issues.  Currently, the three primary issues are as follows: (1) concerns with the design of the Reactor Shield Building which includes steel cladding technology to address aircraft impact; (2) containment sump issues; and (3) Piping Design Analysis Criteria (DAC).  These issues are currently progressing with the NRC review; however, unresolved items remain with each.  WEC, SCE&G and the industry are working with the NRC to resolve the open items associated with the NRC approval of DCD Revision 17.  On April 3, 2009, the NRC issued a letter on the DCD Revision 17 review and approval schedule.  The current NRC schedule shows a December 2010 final SER with an August 2011 final rule making.  This final rule making is a prerequisite for the COLA approval and does not support the COLA approval date for the Units.  WEC continues to work closely with the NRC to address schedule concerns.  WEC has agreed to a series of measures that should accelerate the review schedule or assist in minimizing the impact of any delay on the project schedule.  In addition, SCE&G is preparing contingency plans that should allow it to accelerate the construction schedule to absorb a delay in the issuance of a COL if there is any.  SCE&G believes that reasonable and feasible means are available to accelerate the schedule if necessary.  SCE&G is closely monitoring the DCD Revision 17 review process because of its potential impact on the schedule for the review and approval of the COLA for the Units.  SCE&G has identified the status of the review and approval of DCD Revision 17 as a focus area for on-going monitoring and attention to ensure that WEC does what is required to obtain the necessary approvals on a timely basis.  A summary of the three primary issues is as follows:
 
(1) 
On October 15, 2009, the NRC issued documentation to Westinghouse stating that the proposed design of the shield building for the AP1000 plant will require additional analysis and testing or actual design modifications to ensure compliance with NRC requirements.  In DCD Revision 17, Westinghouse proposed an improved design for the shield building for which design codes or standards do not exist in the U.S.  It is not unusual for the regulator to require more "proof of concept" where the design is ahead of corresponding codes.  WEC has already begun to address certain portions of NRC's concerns and has assured SCE&G that
 
it has committed the resources necessary to address the NRC's concerns both quickly and definitively.
 
(2) 
The NRC has raised concerns related to the functioning of the Sump located at the base of the Containment structure.  The function of the Sump is to collect water that can be recirculated for cooling purposes within the Containment structure.  The NRC's concerns relate to the ability of the Sump to function effectively when debris in the form of piping insulation is present in the water being recirculated.  WEC has established a path forward to successfully resolve the Containment Sump issues with the NRC.  To facilitate the COLA review, WEC has changed the screen area design and the debris limits in the Containment structure to meet the NRC requirements.  WEC plans to subsequently complete a design analysis establishing an allowable pressure differential across the fuel assemblies which would permit the screen area and debris limits to be restored to the initial design.
 
(3) 
In an effort to resolve the DAC issue, WEC and the NRC have agreed that WEC will perform representative piping analyses by the end of February 2010 and incorporate these piping analyses into DCD Revision 18.  The remainder of the piping analyses will be captured in the DAC.  It is planned that the DAC would essentially be a checklist of the piping packages that need to be completed. The activities, completion dates and piping assumptions have been agreed upon by the NRC for inclusion within DCD Revision 18.
 
b)
                                     
Environmental Review (ER)
 
In July 2009, the NRC completed the Phase I scoping of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Units. All ER RAIs and follow-up questions have been answered.  The NRC plans to issue the draft EIS by March 2010 and the Final EIS in February 2011.  This schedule supports the timely issuance of a COL for the Units.
 
c)
                                     
Legal Review
 
As noted previously, several parties sought to intervene to raise issues before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) in its review of SCE&G's COLA.  Under NRC Rules, these potential intervenors were required to demonstrate standing and to list their specific contentions in opposition to the COLA.  To be admitted, contentions must meet relevance and factual support standards.  On February 18, 2009, the ASLB dismissed all potential intervenors either because their contentions were deemed not to be admissible, or because they lacked standing.  The intervenors' appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC.
On January 7, 2010, the NRC issued a ruling that affirmed the ASLB's decision except as to two matters:  First, the NRC granted standing to the Friends of the Earth which had been denied.  Second, the NRC required the ASLB to review on a factual basis the intervenors' contention related to Demand Side Management (DSM) programs.  The intervenors contended that SCE&G had undervalued the contribution that DSM programs could make to reduce the need for power from the Units.  (DSM programs are programs that promote energy efficiency and load management within the Company's customer groups.)
 
In rejecting the intervenors' DSM challenge, the ASLB had relied on a 2005 NRC decision holding that DSM matters were not relevant to the need for power determination in nuclear licensing.  In its January 7, 2010 decision, the NRC ruled that the 2005 decision should not have been relied upon as the sole basis for disallowing the DSM contention because the applicant in the earlier case was the owner/operator of a merchant plant with no means for undertaking any meaningful DSM programs.  As a result, in this proceeding the NRC directed the ASLB to reconsider the intervenors' DSM contention on the facts.  The NRC did not express any view on the merits of the intervenors' DSM contentions or on the factual record before the ASLB regarding DSM. The NRC also ruled that if the ASLB decided that the DSM contention should be admitted and litigated, elements of two other related contentions should be reviewed for potential admission, based on the admission of the DSM contention.
 
The ASLB has not yet taken any action in response to the NRC's order. SCE&G believes that there is ample factual material in the existing record of the proceeding to support the ASLB's rejection of the intervenors' DSM contentions without reference to the 2005 NRC decision.  Nonetheless, the ASLB may ask for additional input from the participants before proceeding further and SCE&G is prepared to supply additional information on this contention.  The additional review of the intervenors' DSM contention is not anticipated to have any impact on the schedule for issuance of a COL for the Units.

Other Permits
 
a)
                                     
DHEC Storm Water Permits
 
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) approved the Phase 7A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Permit (SWPPP) for the Offsite Water System.
b)
                                     
Corps of Engineers Wetlands Permit
 
SCE&G continues to interface with the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) on the ACOE 404 (wetlands) permit and plans to submit the draft permit in early 2010. The ACOE has taken the position that they will not issue a wetlands permit, to include a phased permitting approach, prior to the NRC issuance of the Final EIS. To comply with the ACOE position, Westinghouse/Shaw is finalizing a work-around plan that will not disturb the wetlands in the Cooling Tower area until the Final EIS is approved and the required wetlands permit is issued.  This plan will be technically feasible and will allow construction to proceed within the applicable milestone schedule and financial contingencies.

Appeals of Order No. 2009-104A
 
In May 2009, two intervenors appealed the Commission's Order No. 2009-104A to the South Carolina Supreme Court.  The oral argument in the appeal brought by Friends of the Earth has been set for March 4, 2010.  The final briefs in the appeal brought by the South Carolina Energy Users Committee are on February 25, 2009.

Engineering Completion Status
 
a)
                                     
The Engineering Completion Status based on the completion percentage for major plant categories is as follows:
 
1)
                                    
Standard Plant Design  81.6% complete
 
2)
                                    
Site Specific Design  45.7% complete
 
3)
                                    
Total Design  74.0% complete
 
b)
                                     
To date, the Engineering Completion Status as reported above reflects the work necessary to bring the design outputs to a point where they are sufficient to support procurement, and construction planning.  The project team is beginning to measure the percentage of engineering work related to standard plant design items that have resulted in drawings that are ready for construction.  Ready for construction drawings are being prepared for site specific work.  The completion of the first ready for construction standard plant drawings are at least a year away.  These anticipated dates fully support the construction schedule.

Standard Plant Design Activities
 
During the reporting period, the following standard plant design activities were conducted:
 
a)
                                     
Squib Valve design efforts continue for defining solutions for supporting the valve weight and absorbing the shock loading upon valve actuation in order to reduce the pipe loading.  Valve testing commenced in January 2010 with an estimated completion in April 2010. There is no known adverse impact on the project schedule for Units 2 and 3 from this activity.
 
b)
                                     
During the testing of the Reactor Cooling Pump (RCP) for the China AP1000 projects, the RCP exhibited a problem during coast down from full speed. Several indications were discovered that warranted a root cause analysis which was performed by WEC and the manufacturer, EMD. The corrective action effort and final testing are expected to be completed within the original test schedule. There is no known adverse impact on the project schedule for Units 2 and 3 from this activity.
 
c)
                                     
WEC maintains a system to track the design finalization schedule for major engineering categories and to flag items where design finalization is below WEC expectations.  Currently, WEC has identified several below-expectation items or areas related to activities in the categories of Valves; Piping; Mechanical Modules; and Shaw and Toshiba equipment systems.  The areas that have improved since the third quarter are Instrumentation and Controls; and Procedures.  WEC has provided to SCE&G an explanation and recovery plan for each of the below expectation items.  No adverse impacts on the Units' Substantial Completion dates are anticipated from these items at this time.  However, this is a focus area and will be monitored closely by SCE&G.

Anticipated Construction Schedules
 
As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company and its contractors remain on schedule to complete all required milestones as adjusted pursuant to the milestone schedule contingencies approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A.  Each of those adjustments is itemized in the Milestone Update section that follows.  Accordingly, the project is in compliance with the construction schedules approved by
the Commission in Order No. 2010-12 and with the provisions of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-275(A)(1).

Schedules of the Capital Costs Incurred Including Updates to the Information Required by S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B)(6) (the Inflation Indices)
 
The Capital Cost Update section of this report provides an update of the cumulative capital costs incurred and forecasted to be incurred in completing the project.  These costs are compared to the cumulative capital cost targets approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates, and any use by the Company of the cost and timing contingencies that were approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A.  The Inflation Adjustments and Indices section of this report provides updated information on inflation indices and the changes in them.
 
A.
                                   
Capital Costs Update
 
When adjusted for escalation, the year-end 2009 Cumulative Project Cash Flow as approved in Order No. 2010-12 was $512 million.  During calendar year 2009, SCE&G incurred capital costs for the project amounting to $340 million.  The approved capital cost contingency for 2009, including carry-forward of unused contingency from prior years, was $37.9 million.  Of these contingency funds, $1.1 million was spent in 2009.  As discussed above, these funds were used to cover the 2009 costs associated with Change Order No. 2 and the recalculation of owner's cost.  As provided for in Order No. 2009-104A, unused contingency funds of $36.8 million will be carried forward into 2010.
 
 
The expenditure of $340 million for the project in 2009 results in a year-end 2009 cumulative project cash flow, exclusive of AFUDC, of $463 million.  As shown on when adjusted for timing differences related to Westinghouse/Shaw billing practices, the carry forward of unused contingency and the carry forward of $6 million in forecasted capital costs from 2009 that have been shifted to future years, the resulting amount is approximately $64,000 less than the Cumulative Project Cash Flow approved by the Commission for year-end 2009 as adjusted for inflation.  Apart from the $1.1 million in contingency funds used during this period, these changes in 2009 project expense represent timing differences and not changes in underlying costs.  The Company expects that the forecasted capital costs not incurred in 2009 will be incurred in future periods under the current construction schedule, and those costs have been included in the cash flow projections contained in for those years.

Chart A
of shows the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target as approved in Order No. 2010-12 and as updated for escalation and other Commission approved adjustments under the heading   As shown there, SCE&G has carried forward into 2010 $36.8 million in unused contingency funds from 2009 as permitted by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A.  SCE&G has not used the capital cost schedule contingencies to make any adjustments to the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow as set forth in this filing because the project conforms to approved project cost targets without such adjustments.  Nonetheless, SCE&G does not intend to waive or in any way limit its right, as authorized by the Commission, to make appropriate capital cost contingency adjustments associated with past or future changes in cost scheduling.  SCE&G may make capital cost contingency adjustments related to such changes in its scheduling of capital costs in future filings.

In addition, SCE&G forecasts that it will have budget surpluses sufficient to restore funds to the contingency pool in 2014, 2017 and 2018.  As a result, SCE&G forecasts that it will have $371 million in uncommitted contingency funds at the end of the project.

Included is a history of the annual Handy Whitman All Steam Index, South Atlantic Region; the Handy Whitman All Steam and Nuclear Index, South Atlantic Region; Handy Whitman All Transmission Plant Index, South Atlantic Region; and the Chained GDP Index for the past 10 years.  The changes in these indices and the escalation-related effects of cost rescheduling resulted in a decrease in the projected cost of the Units in future dollars from $6.9 billion as forecast in Order No. 2010-12 to a forecast of $6.3 billion using current inflation data and the current AFUDC rate. The $4.5 billion forecast of the cost of the Units in 2007 dollars, net of AFUDC, remains unchanged.

Conclusion
 
As indicated above, the project is proceeding in compliance with the cost and schedule forecasts approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.  The scheduled completion dates for Units 2 & 3 remain April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  The Units are on track to be completed within the projected cost of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars net of AFUDC.  The Company maintains an extensive staff of experts that monitors and oversees the work of its contractors and has identified and continues to monitor closely all areas of concerns related to either cost or schedule for the project.  The Company will continue to update the Commission and ORS of progress and concerns as the project proceeds.
