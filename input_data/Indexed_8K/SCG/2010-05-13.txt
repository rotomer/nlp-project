Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and UBS are acting as representatives (the Representatives) of the several Underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares.  You represent that you have been authorized by each of the Underwriters to enter into this Agreement on their behalf and to act for them in the manner herein provided in all matters relating to carrying out the provisions of this Agreement.  If there are no Underwriters other than yourselves, the term Underwriters shall be deemed to mean the Representatives.  All obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are several and not joint.
The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters as follows:
1.           .
Agreement to Sell and Purchase
(a)           On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Forward Sellers (and the Company with respect to the Direct Shares and any Company Top-Up Underwritten Shares), severally and jointly, hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters, and each Underwriter, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from each Forward Seller (and the Company with respect to the Direct Shares and any Company Top-Up Underwritten Shares), the respective number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite such Underwriters name in Schedule B hereto at the purchase price set forth in Schedule A hereto (the Purchase Price).
The Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, pursuant to clause (A) or clause (B) below, as applicable, severally and not jointly, up to the number of Option Shares set forth in Schedule A hereto at the Purchase Price less an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Company and payable on the Underwritten Shares but not payable on such Option Shares from and including the Closing Date (as defined herein) to but excluding the
 
 
2
 
 
 
Option Closing Date (as defined herein) (such reduced Purchase Price, the Option Purchase Price).  The Representatives may exercise this right on behalf of the Underwriters in whole or in part by giving written notice not later than thirty (30) days after the date of the Prospectus.  Any exercise notice shall specify the aggregate number of Option Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters and the date on which such shares are to be purchased (the Option Closing Date).  The Option Closing Date must be at least two (2) business days after the written notice is given and may not be earlier than the closing date for the Underwritten Shares nor later than five (5) business days after the date of such notice.  Following delivery of an exercise notice:
(A)           The Company may, in its sole discretion, within one business day after such notice is given, execute and deliver to the applicable Forward Seller an additional forward agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B with each Forward Counterparty (each such agreement, an Additional Forward Agreement) with respect to a number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased as the Number of Additional Forward Shares to be Sold set forth opposite the name of such Forward Counterpartys affiliated Forward Seller in Schedule C bears to the total number of Additional Forward Shares to be Sold (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as the Represe ntatives may determine).  Upon the Companys execution and delivery of an Additional Forward Agreement, the applicable Forward Counterparty shall promptly execute and deliver such Additional Forward Agreement to the Company, and upon such execution and delivery, and on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, the affiliated Forward Seller (and the Company with respect to any Company Top-Up Option Shares), severally and not jointly, hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters, and each Underwriter, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from such Forward Seller (and the Company with respect to any Company Top-Up Option Shares) such Option Shares at the Option Purchase Price.
(B)           To the extent the Company does not timely execute and deliver one or more of the Additional Forward Agreements pursuant to clause (A) above, then on the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters the number of Option Shares underlying the Additional Forward Agreement(s) that were not so executed and delivered, and each Underwriter, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company such number of Option Shares at the Option Purchase Price.
Option Shares may be purchased solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Shares.  On the Option Closing Date, each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company or the Forward Sellers, as applicable, the number of Option Shares (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as the Representatives may determine) that bears the same proportion to the total number of Option Shares as the number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite its name in Schedule B hereto bears to the total number of Underwritten Shares.
(b)           If all of the conditions to effectiveness set forth in Section 3 of the Forward Agreements are not satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date, each Forward Seller, individually, in its sole discretion, may choose not to borrow and deliver for sale, the Borrowed Underwritten Shares.  In addition, in the event that, in the commercially reasonable judgment of a Forward Counterparty, its affiliated Forward Seller is unable to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Underwritten Shares deliverable by such Forward Seller or if, in
 
 
3
 
 
such Forward Counterpartys commercially reasonable judgment, its affiliated Forward Seller would incur a stock loan cost in excess of a rate equal to 200 basis points per annum, then such Forward Seller shall only be required to deliver for sale the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Forward Seller is able to so borrow at or below such cost.
(c)           To the extent that the Company has entered into an Additional Forward Agreement with a Forward Counterparty pursuant to Section 1(a)(A), if (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3A hereto are not true and correct in all material respects as of the Option Closing Date, (ii) the Company has not performed all of the additional obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement on or prior to the Option Closing Date or (iii) the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereto have not been satisfied on or prior to the Option Closing Date (clauses (i)(iii), together, the Option Conditions), then the affiliated Forward Seller, in its sole discretion, may choose not to borrow and deliver for sale the Borrowed Option Shares underlying such Additional Forward Agreement.  In addition, in the event that, in the commercially reasonable judgment of such Forward Counterparty, its affiliated Forward Seller is unable to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Option Shares underlying such Additional Forward Agreement or if, in such Forward Counterpartys commercially reasonable judgment, its affiliated Forward Seller would incur a stock loan cost in excess of a rate equal to 200 basis points per annum, then such Forward Seller shall only be required to deliver for sale the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Forward Seller is able to so borrow at or below such cost.
(d)           If a Forward Seller (i) does not, pursuant to Section 1(b), borrow and deliver for sale the total number of Borrowed Underwritten Shares set forth opposite its name in Schedule B hereto or, (ii) to the extent that its affiliated Forward Counterparty has entered into an Additional Forward Agreement with the Company pursuant to Section 1(a)(A), does not, pursuant to Section 1(c), borrow and deliver for sale the total number of Borrowed Option Shares underlying such Additional Forward Agreement, the Forward Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Company no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the first business day prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be.
2.           .

If the remaining Underwriters shall not take up and pay for all such Shares agreed to be purchased by the defaulting Underwriters, or substitute another underwriter or underwriters as aforesaid, and the Company
