Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104A.  There are 146 separate milestones. Of these, 48 have been completed as of March 31, 2010.  Comparing the milestone completion dates for this quarter to the milestone dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 48 milestones have changed.  Of these, 33 have been accelerated and 15 have been delayed for between one and six months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
As this report indicates, the Company is on track to complete the Units at the construction cost forecast of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars, net of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC"), as approved in Order No. 2009-104A.
 
In Order No. 2009-104A, the Commission recognized that forecasts of AFUDC expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  New escalation indices were issued in early May for the period July-December 2009 and those indices have been used in recalculating and re-forecasting project costs.  As below shows the forecasted construction cost for the project in 2007 dollars is unchanged.
Chart A
 
 
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including escalation and AFUDC, to the forecast presented by the Company in Docket 2009-293-E.  This chart shows that, while the cost of the plant in 2007 dollars remains at the approved $4.5 billion level, the gross construction cost including escalation and AFUDC is $631 million below the revised schedule forecast.  The reduction in the construction cost forecast is due to the changes in forecasted escalation rates when netted against other changes as discussed more fully below.
 
 
E.
                                     
Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104A, the most current 12-month inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the 12 month period after the date of each quarterly report.  Five-year average rates are used to project costs more than 12 months beyond the date of each report.  As a result, with each quarterly filing, the costs for one quarter shift from being forecasted using the five-year indices to being forecasted using the 12-month indices.   This results in a change in forecasted escalation even in quarters where no new escalation indices have been issued.  As stated above, new escalation indices were issued in May 2010 for the period July-December 2009 and those rates are reflected in this report.
 
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have begun to drop.  Current escalation rates are at historical lows.  However, the current five-year averages are now closer to historical rates than they were in certain past periods.  Current escalation rates are shown on , below.
Appendix 4
Chart C
 
 
 
For supplemental analysis purposes, the Company has recomputed project cash flow, net of AFUDC, using both the one-year escalation rates and ten-year escalation rates.  As shown on below, the use of the ten-year rates generates results that are much more comparable to the results generated using the five-year rates than was the case in certain past periods.  Use of one-year rates over the long-term generates cost projections that remain low compared to historical experience.

Increased AFUDC
 
The change in AFUDC for the project is currently projected at $13.6 million compared to the forecast contained in Docket 2009-293-E.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104A, SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress ("CWIP") that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's AFUDC rate is currently 7.10% compared to the rate of 5.87% that applied in Docket 2009-293-E.  Standing alone, this increase in the AFUDC rate would increase the forecasted amount of AFUDC by $54.0 million. However, lower escalation rates have reduced the forecasted project cash flows thereby reducing AFUDC by $40.4 million to produce a $13.6 million net forecasted increase in AFUDC for the project.

Contingency Usage and Availability
 
As below indicates, $1.2 million of the total project contingency of $438 million in 2007 dollars was spent through the close of the current period.  As discussed in more detail below, this $1.2 million reflects additional costs in 2009 and 2010 associated
Chart E
 
with Change Order No. 2 for the project and owner's costs.  The $1.2 million in contingency used to date represents approximately 1.5% of the total 2010 contingency pool of $78.6 million and approximately 0.27% of the total contingency pool for the project of $438 million.
 
 
 
As shown in more detail on , and as discussed below, SCE&G currently forecasts that at the close of 2018 it will have used a cumulative total of $59.5 million of the $438 million contingency fund, in current dollars, to cover the increased escalation costs associated with project schedule changes and changes in base costs for the project.  Of this $59.5 million amount, $58.9 million represents forecasted changes in base costs for the project and the remaining $0.6 million represents forecasted changes related to escalation as a result of shifts in the timing of expenses.  The $58.9 million in contingency funds currently forecasted to be used to cover increases in base costs of the project represent approximately 1.3% of the total unescalated project cost.  This forecasted use of $58.9 million in contingency funds is $5.3 million less than the forecast provided as of December 31, 2009 principally due to further refinement in Owner's cost calculations.  provide a year-by-year statement of forecasted contingency use and changes in that forecast.

Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
Order No. 2009-104A established the Cumulative Project Cash Flow listed on Exhibit F to the Combined Application as the target for measuring the compliance of the project with the cost-related terms of that order.  Order No. 2010-12 updated Exhibit F to conform to the Performance Management Baseline Schedule provided by
 
Westinghouse/Shaw on April 1, 2009.  Order No. 2009-104A provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data and any use by the Company of the cost-related contingencies that the Commission approved in Order No. 2009-104A.
 
Appendix 2, Chart A
provides the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up to December 31, 2009 have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates up to that date.  The cash flow targets for the first quarter of 2010 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices which for purposes of this report are indices provided in May of 2010 that are current through December 31, 2010.  When actual indices for the period December 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010 become available, the 2010 cash flow data for the categories that are subject to indexed escalation will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2, Chart B
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the figures presented on and for 2009 and 2010 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order 2009-104A.  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, Westinghouse/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments in the following period to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to to offset the timing difference related to Westinghouse/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits which applies to those EPC cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.  As shown on the total amount of the resulting adjustment for 2009 has been updated to $1.7 million based on actual escalation rates and the adjustment for the first quarter of 2010 is calculated to be $1.3 million.
Appendix 2, Chart B
Chart C
Appendix 2, Chart B
Appendix 2, Chart B,
 
Appendix 2, Chart B
shows that, due to the effects of timing, the project cash flow in the period 2010-2018 will vary within a range of $13.2 million above to $16 million below target in each year.  As shown on the cumulative use of contingency to cover changes in escalation due to these timing variances is $1.6 million over the life of the project.  In no year does the cumulative use of contingency to cover timing differences exceed $25.3 million.  The current forecast also shows that the total use of contingency to cover both escalation-related costs increases and changes in base cost estimates will be $59.5 million or 1.3% of the total project commitment.
Appendix 2, Chart B,
The projected cash flow figures presented here are in current dollars.  The contingency figures are presented in 2007 dollars before escalation.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Construction of the project is progressing on schedule to meet the Unit 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates of April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  A summary of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.
 
A.
                                   
Licensing and Permitting Update
 
1.
                                     
The Combined Operating License Application (COLA)
 
The COLA review process continues.  The current construction schedule is based on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issuing a Combined Operating License (COL) for the Units no later than July 1, 2011.  Westinghouse (WEC) is expected to complete testing of the new design for the Shield Building in May/June 2010 and submit the test report to the NRC in June/July 2010.  As mentioned in the prior quarterly report, after the test results are accepted by the NRC, Westinghouse intends to file with the NRC a Design Control Document (DCD) revision, DCD Revision 18. DCD Revision 18 will incorporate all of the responses to NRC questions and all of the updates to design matters that have been requested as part of the COLA review process and that are not part of prior amendments.  In light of its assessment of the anticipated schedule for review and approval of DCD Revision 18, SCE&G currently believes that the COL for Units 2 & 3 will be issued in late 2011 or early 2012.  This schedule for the issuance of the COL would impact certain aspects of the construction schedule for the Units.  However, SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw do not believe that a COL issuance date of late 2011 or early 2012 will adversely impact the scheduled Substantial Completion dates of Unit 2 or of Unit 3.  SCE&G will continue to carefully monitor and proactively manage this aspect of the COL schedule.  As the schedule for the filing and approval of DCD Revision 18 becomes better known, SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw will make any required revisions to the construction schedule to reflect the anticipated issuance date of the COL. SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw are evaluating steps that could be taken to accelerate construction if necessary and are confident that any delay in the issuance of the COL will not necessarily delay the Substantial Completion dates of the Units.  The status of the major COLA review areas is as follows:
 
a)
                                     
Nuclear Safety Review
 
1)
                                    
The Staff of the NRC has completed its Phase 1 review to support development of the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the Units,
 
which includes the COLA review and issuance of NRC Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) to SCE&G for resolution. During the Phase 2 review, SCE&G will continue to respond to NRC questions that may arise.  The Phase 2 review of the SER is intended to result in the development of the SER with no open items.
 
The NRC continues the SER review of the WEC DCD Revision 17.  WEC, SCE&G and the industry are working with the NRC to resolve the open items associated with the NRC approval of DCD Revision 17.  On April 3, 2009, the NRC issued a letter on the DCD Revision 17 review and approval schedule.  The current NRC schedule shows a December 2010 final SER with an August 2011 final rule making.  This final rule making is a prerequisite for the COLA approval and does not support the COLA approval date for the Units defined in the EPC Contract.
 
Currently, the primary issue related to DCD-17 is the concern with the design of the Reactor Shield Building which includes steel cladding technology to address aircraft impact.  On October 15, 2009, the NRC issued documentation to Westinghouse stating that the proposed design of the shield building for the AP1000 plant will require additional analysis and testing or actual design modifications to ensure compliance with NRC requirements.  In DCD Revision 17, Westinghouse proposed an improved design for the shield building for which design codes or standards do not exist in the U.S.  It is not unusual for the regulator to require more "proof of concept" where the design is ahead of corresponding codes.  WEC has already begun to address certain portions of NRC's concerns and has assured SCE&G that it has committed the resources necessary to address the NRC's concerns both quickly and definitively.  WEC continues to work closely with the NRC to address schedule concerns related to the approval of DCD-17 in light of NRC's issues.  WEC has agreed to a series of measures that should accelerate the review schedule or assist in minimizing the impact of any delay on the project schedule.  In addition, SCE&G is preparing contingency plans that should allow it to accelerate the construction schedule to absorb a delay in the issuance of a COL if there is any.  SCE&G believes that reasonable and feasible means are available to accelerate the schedule if necessary.
 
As to other issues, substantial progress has been made in resolving the NRC's issues related to the Containment Sump and Piping Design Analysis Criteria (DAC). These are no longer seen as issues affecting the schedule for the approval of DCD-17.
 
SCE&G is closely monitoring the DCD Revision 17 review process because of its potential impact on the schedule for the review and approval of the COLA for the Units.  SCE&G has identified the status of the review and approval of DCD Revision 17 as a focus area for on-going monitoring and attention to
 
ensure that WEC does what is required to obtain the necessary approvals on a timely basis.
 
b)
                                     
Environmental Review (ER)
 
In July 2009, the NRC completed the Phase I scoping of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Units. All ER RAIs and follow-up questions have been answered.  The NRC issued the draft EIS on April 15, 2010, subsequent to this reporting period.  The Final EIS is scheduled to be issued in February 2011.  This schedule supports the timely issuance of a COL for the Units.
 
c)
                                     
Legal Review
 
As noted previously, several parties sought to intervene to raise issues before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) in its review of SCE&G's COLA.  Under NRC Rules, these potential intervenors were required to demonstrate standing and to list their specific contentions in opposition to the COLA.  To be admitted, contentions must meet relevance and factual support standards.  On February 18, 2009, the ASLB dismissed all potential intervenors either because their contentions were deemed not to be admissible, or because they lacked standing.  The intervenors appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC.
 
On January 7, 2010, the NRC issued a ruling that affirmed the ASLB's decision except as to two matters:  First, the NRC granted standing to the Friends of the Earth which had been denied.  Second, the NRC required the ASLB to review on a factual basis the intervenors' contention related to Demand Side Management (DSM) programs.  (DSM programs are programs that promote energy efficiency and load management within the Company's customer groups.) The intervenors contended that SCE&G had undervalued the contribution that DSM programs could make to reduce the need for power from the Units.
 
In rejecting the intervenors' DSM challenge, the ASLB had relied on a 2005 NRC decision holding that DSM matters were not relevant to the need for power determination in nuclear licensing.  In its January 7, 2010 decision, the NRC ruled that the 2005 decision should not have been relied upon as the sole basis for disallowing the DSM contention because the applicant in the earlier case was the owner/operator of a merchant plant with no means for undertaking any meaningful DSM programs.  As a result, in this proceeding the NRC directed the ASLB to reconsider the intervenors' DSM contention on the facts.  The NRC did not express any view on the merits of the intervenors' DSM contentions or on the factual record before the ASLB regarding DSM.  The NRC also ruled that if the ASLB decided that the DSM contention should be admitted and litigated, elements
 
of two other related contentions should also be reviewed for potential admission, based on the admission of the DSM contention.
 
On March 17, 2010, the ASLB considered the merits of the intervenors' DSM contentions and issued an order rejecting all contentions of the intervenors.  The intervenors have appealed the ASLB order on remand to the NRC. On April 5, 2010, SCE&G filed an opposing brief to the NRC.

Other Permits
 
a)
                                     
DHEC Storm Water Permits
 
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) approved modifications of the Phase 4 Storm Water Pollution Prevention Permit (SWPPP) to accommodate layout changes to the Switchyard and the Construction Permit for the construction of two (2) concrete batch plants.
 
b)
                                     
Corps of Engineers Wetlands Permit
 
SCE&G continues to interface with the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) on the ACOE 404 (wetlands) permit and submitted the draft permit during the 1
st
 Quarter 2010. The permit application was noticed for public comment in April 2010. The ACOE has taken the position that it will not issue a wetlands permit, to include a phased permitting approach, prior to the NRC issuance of the Final EIS. To comply with the ACOE position, Westinghouse/Shaw is finalizing a work-around plan that will not disturb the wetlands in the Cooling Tower area until the Final EIS is approved and the required wetlands permit is issued.  This plan will be technically feasible and will allow construction to proceed within the applicable milestone schedule and financial contingencies.

Appeals of Order No. 2009-104A
 
In May 2009, two intervenors appealed the Commission's Order No. 2009-104A to the South Carolina Supreme Court.  The oral arguments in the appeals brought by Friends of the Earth and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee were held on March 4 and April 6, 2010 (subsequent to this reporting period), respectively.  On April 26, 2010, subsequent to this reporting period, the South Carolina Supreme Court, affirmed the Base Load Review Order issued by the Commission in the appeal initiated by Friends of the Earth.  Friends of the Earth had 15 days to file a rehearing petition and no petition for rehearing was filed.  The South Carolina Supreme Court has not yet issued an opinion in the South Carolina Energy Users Committee's appeal.

Engineering Completion Status
 
a)
                                     
The Engineering Completion Status based on the completion percentage for major plant categories is as follows:
 
1)
                                    
Standard Plant Design  84.0% complete
 
2)
                                    
Site Specific Design  53.0% complete
 
3)
                                    
Total Design  76.7% complete
 
b)
                                     
To date, the Engineering Completion Status as reported above reflects the work necessary to bring the design outputs to a point where they are sufficient to support procurement, and construction planning.  The project team is measuring the percentage of engineering work related to standard plant design items that have resulted in drawings that are ready for construction.  Ready for construction drawings are being prepared for site specific work.  The completion of the first ready for construction standard plant drawings are at least a year away.  These anticipated dates fully support the construction schedule.
 
2.
                                     
Standard Plant Design Activities
 
During the reporting period, the following standard plant design activities were conducted:
 
a)
                                     
Squib Valve prototype testing has resumed after modifications to improve the absorbance of shock loading resulting from valve actuation.  The first test of the modified prototype was successfully completed on February 19, 2010.  Testing will continue with the completion of testing projected in May 2010.  There remains no known adverse impact on the project schedule for Units 2 and 3 from this activity.
 
b)
                                     
During the testing of the Reactor Cooling Pump (RCP) for the China AP1000 projects, the RCP exhibited a problem during coast down from full speed.  Several indications were discovered that warranted a root cause analysis which was performed by WEC and the manufacturer, EMD.  Detailed plans have been formulated for material changes, design changes for internal components and additional developmental testing.  Preparations are underway for the second diagnostic test in May 2010.  The corrective action effort and final testing are expected to be completed within the original test schedule.  There is no known
adverse impact on the project schedule for Units 2 and 3 from this activity.  This is a focus area.
 
c)
                                     
WEC maintains a system to track the design finalization schedule for major engineering categories and to flag items where design finalization is below WEC expectations related to support of the China AP1000 projects.  Currently, WEC has identified several below-expectation items or areas related to activities in the categories of Shield Building, Piping, and Shaw and Toshiba equipment systems.  The areas that have improved since the fourth quarter of 2009 are Instrumentation and Controls, and Procedures.  WEC has provided to SCE&G an explanation and recovery plan for each of the below expectation items.  No adverse impacts on the Units' Substantial Completion dates are anticipated from these items at this time.  However, this is a focus area and will be monitored closely by SCE&G.
 
3.
                                     
Site Specific Design Activities
 
a)
                                     
Shaw Engineering continues to perform Site Specific Design work to support the permitting and licensing activities. Geotechnical evaluations continue. This work is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.
 
b)
                                     
Design continues for Site Specific Systems, to include the Circulating Water System, Potable Water System, Raw Water System, and the Storm Water System, Communication Systems and the Switchyard.  This work is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.

Procurement/Fabrication Update
 
1.
                                     
The start up of the Shaw Modular Solutions (SMS) facility in Lake Charles, LA has experienced delays in the start of fabrication of structural modules due primarily to implementation of the Quality Assurance plan and delays in receiving the WEC design packages for the modules it will construct. SMS and WEC are addressing these issues and plan to begin the module fabrication the first part of May 2010 which will support the overall project schedule.  On April 6, 2010, subsequent to this reporting period, SCE&G and the Consortium senior management visited the SMS facility and reviewed the module fabrication status.

Doosan is experiencing delays in the fabrication of the Reactor Vessel for Unit 2.  After a comprehensive review, Doosan determined that the delays resulted primarily from Doosan's scheduling of manufacturing process and the failure to optimize it.  The Doosan recovery plan includes an optimization of the fabrication process with emphasis on the welding sequence.  Also, Doosan has agreed to give first priority to the AP1000 project where there are conflicts with domestic South Korean projects.  Doosan is also holding daily "tool box meetings" for the fabrication of the Reactor Vessel components and re-evaluating the Reactor Vessel nozzle welding program for its subcontractor PCI.  In addition, Doosan has implemented a Total Operational Excellence program and has challenged the Doosan project management team to closely monitor the manufacturing process.  The "Reactor Vessel Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Outlet Nozzle Welding to Flange Nozzle Shell Completion  Unit 2" is a BLRA milestone and is +6 months behind the reset milestone date.  This delay does not appear to adversely impact the receipt of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel on site (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-6).
 
Subsequent to this reporting period, and consistent with its quality assurance plan, Doosan reported that inspections had discovered a crack in the forging for the Unit 2 2B Steam Generator channel head. This forging is being scrapped and a cause and corrective action review is in process.  Also, the schedule impact is being assessed, although there is no apparent impact on the next associated milestone, which is the milestone for Contractor Acceptance of the Steam Generator Equipment at the Port of Entry (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-2).  The SCE&G NND Engineering Manager and NND QA representative visited the Doosan shop in South Korea during the week of April 26, 2010, subsequent to this reporting period, to review this issue.  This is a focus area.
 
3.
                                     
All hollow forgings were completed for the Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Reactor Coolant Loop (RCL) Piping hot legs.  This work is being performed by IBF, a subcontractor to Tioga.  Both companies are located in Italy. Subsequent to the hollow forging, and consistent with its quality assurance plan, IBF discovered that the grain size for the 2B RCL hot leg pipe was unacceptable.  This forging was scrapped and a new forging is planned for May 2010.  There is no apparent impact to the shipment of the Unit 2 RCL piping to the site (BLRA milestone 11-4Q-5).  This condition occurred subsequent to this reporting period.

Change Control/Owners Cost Forecast Update
 
1.
                                     
Contract Amendment #1 continues to be processed to revise the language in several areas of the EPC Contract.  These revisions represent updates to the EPC Contract, such as contract language clarifications in the sections relating to Changes in the Work, changes made to the Major Equipment Supplier and Contractor exhibits and changes in the milestone payment schedules due to the Performance Management Baseline Schedule received on April 1, 2009.  There are no changes in forecasted costs related to this item.
 
2.
                                     
SCE&G continues to update its forecast of Owner's Costs to reflect increases in the anticipated costs of project oversight and operations staffing, licensing and other items.  These changes involve forecasted costs only.  SCE&G will continue to review and update these cost projections.  The most recent updates have resulted in reduction in the forecast of Owner's Costs.
 
3.
                                     
Change Order No. 1 for the training of the Reactor Operator Training Instructors by WEC is being revised to accommodate agreed upon schedule changes for the training that will allow time for improvements to the WEC training simulator software. WEC and SCE&G have agreed to document this change via a new Change Order No. 5 replacing Change Order No. 1. This will result in an increased cost to SCE&G to be covered by the Time & Material allocation as part of the EPC Contract. There will be no increase to the EPC Contract price or use of contingency.
 
4.
                                     
Change Order No. 3 for the Parr Road rehabilitation was approved by SCE&G during this quarter.  This change order increased the EPC Contract price and will be paid for using the Owner's Cost contingency.
 
5.
                                     
Change Order No. 4 for the transfer of the module fabrication and Site assembly scope of work from WEC to Shaw is being reviewed by SCE&G. This change order is a "no cost" change order and will not change the EPC Contract price.
 
6.
                                     
The change in cash flow forecast related to all change orders to date and changes in Owner's Costs is forecast to be $58.9 million in 2007 dollars, the largest component of which is the change in Owner's Cost.  The $58.9 million cost change is reflected in the cash flow projections contained in the exhibits to this Quarterly Report.

Transmission Update
 
1.
                                     
SCE&G's Power Delivery group continues with the transmission line siting process for determining the precise routes for the new VC Summer Unit 1  Killian 230kV line, the VC Summer Unit 2  Lake Murray #2 230kV line, and the VC Sumer Unit 3  St. George #1 and #2 230kV lines.  These new lines are needed to connect the Units to the grid.
 
2.
                                     
The VC Summer Unit 1- Killian line is being sited in three phases: VCS-Winnsboro, Winnsboro-Blythewood, and Blythewood-Killian.  A first public workshop was held on October 29, 2009 to gain public input for the Blythewood-Killian section.  A second public workshop was held on March 16, 2010 to receive public comments on proposed alternate routes for this line. A final route is expected to be determined in June 2010.  The first public workshop for the Winnsboro-Blythewood section was held on April 15, 2010 with a second workshop expected to be held in June/July 2010.  The remaining section (VCS-Winnsboro) will occupy existing right of way and no formal workshops are planned.
 
3.
                                     
For the VC Summer Unit 2  Lake Murray #2 230kV line, SCE&G Power Delivery expects this line route will be constructed entirely within existing rights of way.  SCE&G's Power Delivery group has completed an initial inventory survey of one of its existing right of way corridors and is in the process of conducting title searches to determine the quality of and resolve certain encroachments that were discovered.  Power Delivery has completed the evaluated the evaluation of a second corridor as part of the process of analyzing and determining a final route for this line.
 
4.
                                     
Power Delivery has completed acquisition of additional land in St. George, South Carolina that will allow for installation of the breaker-and-a-half switchyard configuration needed to connect Unit 3 via two new VC Summer  St. George 230kV lines.  SCE&G is investigating the availability of existing rights of way which could minimize the overall siting process for the VC Summer-St. George 230kV lines.  A determination with respect to these lines is expected within the next months.
 
Shaw and Pike Electric continue progress of the 230kV Switchyard design.  Completed designs include grounding, foundation, the control house, station service and varying aspects of the system protection relaying.  Reviews of these
designs were conducted by SCE&G Power Delivery Engineering Department.  A 60% Design Review is scheduled for June 2010.

Schedules of the Capital Costs Incurred Including Updates to the Information Required by S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B)(6) (the Inflation Indices)
 
The Capital Cost Update section of this report provides an update of the cumulative capital costs incurred and forecasted to be incurred in completing the project.  These costs are compared to the cumulative capital cost targets approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates, and any use by the Company of the cost and timing contingencies that were approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A.  The Inflation Adjustments and Indices section of this report provides updated information on inflation indices and the changes in them.
A.
                                   
Capital Costs Update
 
When adjusted for escalation, the year-end 2010 Cumulative Project Cash Flow as approved in Order No. 2010-12 is $939.0 million.  The current forecast of the Revised Cumulative Project Cash Flow, as of December 31, 2010, shows that SCE&G will have spent $936.5 on the project by that date.  This amount includes the forecasted commitment of $5.2 million in contingency funds in 2010 and the commitment of $1.1 million of contingency funds during past periods.  It also includes uncommitted contingency funds of $72.3 million which would be available to be carried forward into 2011.
 
The forecasted expenditure for the project in 2010 exclusive of AFUDC is $473.9 million.  As shown on the cumulative amount to be spent on the project as of December 31, 2010 is forecasted to be approximately $5.5 million less than the Cumulative Project Cash Flow approved by the Commission for year-end 2010 as adjusted for inflation and Westinghouse/Shaw billing differences.  The $5.5 million difference in Cumulative Project Cash Flow as compared to target represents timing differences and not changes in underlying costs.  The Company expects that the forecasted base capital costs not incurred in 2010 will be incurred in future periods under the current construction schedule, and those costs have been included in the cash flow projections contained in for future years.
Appendix 2, Chart B, line 30,

Chart A
of shows the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target as approved in Order No. 2010-12 and as updated for escalation and other Commission approved adjustments under the heading   As shown there, SCE&G has carried forward into 2010 $36.8 million in unused contingency funds from 2009 as permitted by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A.  SCE&G has not used the capital cost schedule contingencies to make any adjustments to the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow as set forth in this filing because the project conforms to approved project cost targets without such adjustments.  Nonetheless, SCE&G does not intend to waive or in any way limit its right, as authorized by the Commission, to make appropriate capital cost contingency adjustments associated with past or future changes in cost scheduling.  SCE&G may make capital cost contingency adjustments related to such changes in its scheduling of capital costs in future filings.

contingency pool in 2014, 2017 and 2018.  As a result, SCE&G forecasts that it will have $379 million in uncommitted contingency funds at the end of the project.
 
The information presented in establishes that the anticipated cumulative project cash flow for the period ending December 31, 2010, is in conformity with the schedule approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12 and with the provisions of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-275(A)(1).  It also establishes that the Company's best forecasts of future project costs are fully consistent with the Cumulative Project Cash Flows approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.
