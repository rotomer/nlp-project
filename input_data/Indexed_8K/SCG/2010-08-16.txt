Introduction and Summary
 
A.
           
Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company ("SCE&G" or "Company") to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the "Commission") and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff ("ORS").  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2009) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104A.  This report provides updated information concerning the status of construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station Units 2 & 3 (the "Units") and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units as approved in Order No. 2009-104A and Order No. 2010-12.  Order No. 2009-104A is the base load review order related to the Units that was issued by the Commission on February 27, 2009.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules and construction milestone schedules for the Units in Order No. 2010-12.
 
On August 9, 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued its opinion in , Op. No. 26856 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 9, 2010) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 31 at 117) (the "Opinion").  In the Opinion, the Court ruled that capital cost contingencies were not permitted as a part of approved capital cost forecasts under the Base Load Review Act.  The effect of this decision is to remove $438,291,000 in contingency funds from the capital cost estimates approved in Orders No. 2009-104A and 2010-12.  The court's decision left open to SCE&G the option to petition the Commission to update the approved cash flow projections for the project to include additional costs.  The Base Load Review Act requires such updates to be allowed unless the additional costs are proven to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  In addition, the Supreme Court rules allow petitions for reconsideration of its opinions to be filed within fifteen (15) days of an opinion being issued.
South Carolina Energy Users Comm. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Comm'n
 
This quarterly report and the financial analysis presented here were substantially complete at the time the Opinion was issued.  Because of time constraints, the Company determined that it was not feasible to update the financial analysis contained in this report to reflect the removal of contingencies from the capital cost projections for the project as
approved by the Commission and the financial analyses based on them.  Accordingly, the financial data contained here reflects a $438,291,000 contingency pool which under terms of the Opinion must be removed from the Commission-approved capital cost projections going forward.  The Company intends to file updated information showing the effect of the removal of this contingency pool in the future.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104A.  There are 146 separate milestones.  Of these, 53 have been completed as of June 30, 2010.  Comparing the milestone completion dates for this quarter to the milestone dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 50 milestones have changed.  Of these, 30 have been accelerated and 20 have been delayed for between one and nine months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
As this report indicates, the Company is on track to complete the Units at the original construction cost forecast of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars, net of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC"), that the Commission approved in Order No. 2009-104A.  However, the Opinion will require the Commission-approved capital cost forecast to be reduced to $4.1 billion to reflect removal of the $438 million capital cost contingency fund.   SCE&G's actual and forecasted use of contingency funds is set forth on attached to this report.  As indicated on , SCE&G presently forecasts using $83.8 million in contingency funds during the course of the project.  In future filings with the Commission, SCE&G plans to seek the inclusion of additional costs in the approved capital costs of the project.
Appendix 2, Chart C
Appendix 2, Chart C
 
In Order No. 2009-104A, the Commission recognized that forecasts of AFUDC expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  New escalation indices were issued in early May for the period July-December 2009 and those indices have been used in recalculating and re-forecasting project costs.  As below shows the forecasted construction cost for the project in 2007 dollars is unchanged.
Chart A
 
 
 
*
As discussed above, these figures include the $438 million contingency fund.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has determined that the contingency fund was inappropriately included in the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. Adjusted figures will be supplied in future filings.
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including escalation and AFUDC, to the forecast presented by the Company in Docket 2009-293-E.  This chart shows that, while the cost of the plant in 2007 dollars remains at the $4.5 billion level initially approved by the Commission, the gross construction cost including escalation and AFUDC is $649 million below the revised schedule forecast (but see the discussion above concerning the effects of the recent Supreme Court Opinion which reduces the Commission-approved target to $4.1 billion).  The reduction in the construction cost forecast is due to the changes in forecasted escalation rates when netted against other changes as discussed more fully below.

As discussed above, these figures include the $438 million contingency fund.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has determined that the contingency fund was inappropriately included in the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. Adjusted figures will be supplied in future filings.
 
E.
            
Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104A, the most current twelve-month inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  Five-year average rates are used to project costs more than twelve months beyond the date of each report.  As a result, with each quarterly filing, the costs for one quarter shift from being forecasted using the five-year indices to being forecasted using the twelve-month indices.   This results in a change in forecasted escalation even in quarters where no new escalation indices have been issued.  As stated above, new escalation indices were issued in May 2010 for the period July-December 2009 and those rates are reflected in this report.
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have begun to drop.  Current escalation rates are at historical lows.  However, the current five-year averages are now closer to historical rates than they were in certain past periods.  Current escalation rates are shown on , below.
Appendix 4
Chart C
 
 
For supplemental analysis purposes, the Company has recomputed project cash flow, net of AFUDC, using both the one-year escalation rates and ten-year escalation rates.  As shown on below, the use of the ten-year rates generates results that are much more comparable to the results generated using the five-year rates than was the case in certain past periods.  Use of one-year rates over the long-term generates cost projections that remain low compared to historical experience.
Chart D
 
 
 
*
As discussed above, these figures include the $438 million contingency fund.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has determined that the contingency fund was inappropriately included in the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. Adjusted figures will be supplied in future filings.
 
F.
            
Increased AFUDC(1)
 
The change in AFUDC for the project is currently projected at $14.0 million compared to the forecast contained in Docket 2009-293-E.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104A, SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress ("CWIP") that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's AFUDC rate is currently 7.10% compared to the rate of 5.87% that applied in Docket 2009-293-E.  Standing alone, this increase in the AFUDC rate would increase the forecasted amount of AFUDC by $53 million. However, lower escalation rates have reduced the forecasted project cash flows thereby reducing AFUDC by $39 million to produce a $14.0 million net forecasted increase in AFUDC for the project.
 
G.
           
Contingency Usage and Availability
 
As Chart E below indicates, $2.3 million of the project contingency originally approved in Order No. 2009-104A was spent through the close of the current period.  Based on the Opinion of the Supreme Court that is discussed above, the $438 million contingency fund approved in Order No. 2009-104A must be removed from approved capital cost projections for the project, and the additional costs that are currently forecasted to be spent must be approved by the Commission to be recognized under the Base Load Review Act.
 
As discussed in more detail below, this $2.3 million reflects additional costs in 2009 and 2010 associated with Change Order Nos. 2 and 3 for the project and owner's costs.  The $2.3 million in contingency used to date represents approximately 2.9% of the total contingency pool of $78.6 million that the Commission originally approved for 2010 and approximately 0.5% of the total contingency pool for the project of $438 million.
 
(1)  All AFUDC calculations contained in this section were based on the assumption that SCE&G would use the entire $438 million contingency fund approved in Order No. 2009-104A over the course of the project.  As discussed above, these figures include the $438 million contingency fund.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has determined that the contingency fund was inappropriately included in the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. Adjusted figures will be supplied in future filings.
 
 
* As discussed above, these figures include the $438 million contingency fund.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has determined that the contingency fund was inappropriately included in the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. Adjusted figures will be supplied in future filings.
 
As shown in more detail on , and as discussed below, SCE&G currently forecasts that at the close of 2018 it will have used a cumulative total of $83.8 million of the $438 million contingency fund, in current dollars, that was originally approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A.  Of this $83.8 million amount, $81.3 million represents forecasted changes in base costs for the project and the remaining $2.5 million represents forecasted changes related to escalation as a result of shifts in the timing of expenses. The $81.3 million currently forecasted to be used to cover increases in base costs of the project represent approximately 1.8% of the total unescalated project cost.  This forecasted use of $81.3 million is $22.4 million greater than the forecast provided as of March 31, 2010 principally due to further refinement in Owner's cost calculations.  provide a year-by-year statement of forecasted contingency use and changes in that forecast.

Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
Order No. 2009-104A established the Cumulative Project Cash Flow listed on Exhibit F to the Combined Application as the target for measuring the compliance of the project with the cost-related terms of that order.  Order No. 2010-12 updated Exhibit F to
 
conform to the Performance Management Baseline Schedule provided by Westinghouse/Shaw on April 1, 2009.  Order No. 2009-104A provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data and any use by the Company of the cost-related contingencies that the Commission approved in Order No. 2009-104A.  As discussed above, all the figures presented in these charts include the $438 million contingency fund that the Commission approved in Order No. 2009-104A.  The South Carolina Supreme Court has ruled that this fund may not be included in the Commission-approved capital cost projections for the project.  Adjusted figures will be provided in future filings.
 
Appendix 2, Chart A
provides the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up to December 31, 2009 have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates up to that date.  The cash flow targets for the first quarter of 2010 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices which for purposes of this report are indices provided in May of 2010 that are current through December 31, 2009.  When actual indices for the period January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2010 become available, the 2010 cash flow data for the categories that are subject to indexed escalation will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2, Chart B
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the figures presented on and for 2009 and 2010 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order 2009-104A.  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, Westinghouse/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments in the following period to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to to offset the timing difference related to Westinghouse/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits which applies to those EPC cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.  As shown on the total amount of the resulting adjustment for 2009 has been updated to $1.7 million based on actual escalation rates and the adjustment for the first six months of 2010 is calculated to be ($1.4 million).
Appendix 2, Chart B
Chart C
Appendix 2, Chart B
Appendix 2, Chart B,
 
Appendix 2, Chart B
shows that, due to the effects of timing, the project cash flow in the period 2010-2018 will vary within a range of $29.4 million above to $62.3 million below target in each year.  As shown on the cumulative amount of funds necessary to cover changes in escalation due to these timing variances is $2.5 million over the life of the project.  In no year does the cumulative amount of additional expense associated with timing differences exceed $20.8 million.  The current
Appendix 2, Chart B,
 
forecast also shows that the total additional funds necessary to cover both escalation-related cost increases and changes in base cost estimates will be $83.8 million or 1.8% of the total project commitment, including contingency funds.
 
The projected cash flow figures presented here are in current dollars, and as indicated above include the $438 million contingency fund that the South Carolina Supreme Court has now ruled is not a proper part of the Commission-approved capital cost forecast for the project.  The contingency figures are presented in 2007 dollars before escalation.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Construction of the project is progressing on schedule to meet the Unit 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates of April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  A summary of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.
 
A.
           
Licensing and Permitting Update
 
1.
            
The Combined Operating License Application (COLA)
 
The COLA review process continues. Westinghouse (WEC) completed testing of the new design for the Shield Building on May 26, 2010 and submitted the test report to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on May 30, 2010.  After the test results are accepted by the NRC, Westinghouse intends to file with the NRC a Design Control Document (DCD) revision, DCD Revision 18. DCD Revision 18 will incorporate all of the responses to NRC questions and all of the updates to design matters that have been requested as part of the COLA review process and that are not part of prior amendments.  In light of its assessment of the anticipated schedule for review and approval of DCD Revision 18, SCE&G currently believes that the COL for Units 2 & 3 will be issued in late 2011 or early 2012.  This schedule for the issuance of the COL would impact certain aspects of the construction schedule for the Units.  However, Westinghouse/Shaw are conducting an analysis of whether changes in the construction program will be required to ensure that a COL issuance date of late 2011 will not adversely impact the scheduled Substantial Completion dates of Unit 2 or of Unit 3.  SCE&G will continue to carefully monitor and proactively manage this aspect of the COL schedule.  As the schedule for the filing and approval of DCD Revision 18 becomes better known, SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw will make any required revisions to the construction schedule to reflect the anticipated issuance date of the COL. SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw are evaluating steps that could be taken to accelerate construction if necessary and are confident that any delay in the issuance of the COL will not necessarily delay the Substantial Completion dates of
 
the Units.  This continues to be a focus area. The status of the major COLA review areas is as follows:
 
a)
                                     
Nuclear Safety Review
 
The Staff of the NRC has completed its Phase 1 review to support development of the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the Units, which includes the COLA review and issuance of NRC Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) to SCE&G for resolution. The Phase 2 review continues with SCE&G responding to NRC questions.  The Phase 2 review of the SER is intended to result in the development of the SER with no open items.
 
The NRC continues the SER review of the DCD-17 with a goal to complete all technical input to the SER by August 30, 2010.  WEC, SCE&G and the industry are working with the NRC to resolve the open items associated with the NRC approval of DCD-17.  On June 21, 2010, the NRC issued a letter on the DCD-17 review and approval schedule.  The current NRC schedule shows a December 2010 final SER with a September 2011 final rule making.  The NRC plans to provide updated schedule feedback by the end of August 2010.
 
Currently, the primary issue related to DCD-17 is the concern with the design of the Reactor Shield Building which includes steel cladding technology to address aircraft impact.  On October 15, 2009, the NRC issued documentation to Westinghouse stating that the proposed design of the shield building for the AP1000 plant will require additional analysis and testing or actual design modifications to ensure compliance with NRC requirements.  In DCD-17, Westinghouse proposed an improved design for the shield building for which design codes or standards do not exist in the U.S.  It is not unusual for the regulator to require more "proof of concept" where the design is ahead of corresponding codes.  As stated above, WEC has committed to provide the NRC with the data and inputs necessary to resolve all open items related to DCD-17 by August 30, 2010 and seems to be on track to meet this goal. WEC continues to work closely with the NRC to address schedule concerns related to the approval of DCD-17 in light of NRC's issues.  WEC has also agreed to a series of measures that should accelerate the review schedule or assist in minimizing the impact of any delay on the project schedule and is making progress in this effort.  In addition, SCE&G is preparing contingency plans that should allow it to accelerate the construction schedule.   SCE&G will continue to work with WEC/Shaw in an effort to mitigate any delay in issuance of a COL for the Units.
 
SCE&G is closely monitoring the DCD-17 review process because of its potential impact on the schedule for the review and approval of the COLA for the Units.  SCE&G has identified the status of the review and approval of
 
DCD-17 as a focus area for on-going monitoring and attention to ensure that WEC does what is required to obtain the necessary approvals on a timely basis.
 
An issue related to the site-specific COLA review concerns the wet bulb temperature (relative humidity) at the site compared to the standard parameters on which the DCD approval was based.  WEC has sought an exemption from this standard for purposes of the site-specific COLA review for the Units.  Specific RAI responses have been submitted to the NRC for review on this exemption request, and NRC approval is expected with no issues.
 
b)
                                     
Environmental Review
 
In July 2009, the NRC completed the Phase I scoping of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Units.  All Environmental Report RAIs and follow-up questions have been answered.  The NRC issued the draft EIS on April 15, 2010 to which SCE&G has responded.  The Final EIS is scheduled to be issued in February 2011.  This schedule supports the timely issuance of a COL for the Units.
 
c)
                                     
Legal Review
 
As noted previously, several parties sought to intervene to raise issues before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) in its review of SCE&G's COLA and their interventions were dismissed either because their contentions were deemed not to be admissible, or because they lacked standing.  The intervenors appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC.
 
On January 7, 2010, the NRC issued a ruling that affirmed the ASLB's decision but required the ASLB to review on a factual basis the intervenors' contention related to Demand Side Management (DSM) programs.  In rejecting the intervenors' DSM challenge, the ASLB had relied on a 2005 NRC decision holding that DSM matters were not relevant to the need for power determination in nuclear licensing.  The NRC directed the ASLB to reconsider the intervenors' DSM contention on the facts.
 
On March 17, 2010, the ASLB considered the merits of the intervenors' DSM contentions and issued an order rejecting all contentions of the intervenors.  The intervenors have appealed the ASLB order on remand to the NRC. On April 5, 2010, SCE&G filed an opposing brief to the NRC.

Other Permits
 
a)
                                     
SCDHEC Permits
 
1)
             
SCE&G received from SCDHEC a construction permit to construct/install the Potable Water Distribution System (PWS) from the Off Site Water System to the Table Top Area.
2)
             
SCE&G received from SCDHEC an operating permit associated with the NPDES General Industrial Stormwater Permit for the Concrete Batch Plant Operations.
3)
             
The construction of Concrete Batch Plant #1 is complete. SCE&G has formally requested SCDHEC approval to place this plant into operation and is awaiting the Conditional Major General Permit for Concrete Batch Plants.
 
b)
                                     
Corps of Engineers Wetlands Permit
 
SCE&G continues to interface with the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) on the ACOE 404 (wetlands) permit for construction work on the site and submitted the draft permit during the 1
st
 Quarter 2010. There is only one wetland area on the site that is of concern.  It is located near the Cooling Towers area and is very limited in size. The permit application related to this area was noticed for public comment in April 2010 with the comment period ending on July 9, 2010. Several commenting agencies made comments related to their concerns about the lack of specific transmission line routing data related to the off-site transmission lines to be constructed to integrate the Units into the grid.  Discussions between SCE&G and the ACOE to determine a path forward are in progress.
 
The ACOE has taken the position that it will not issue a wetlands permit for this area until the NRC issuance of the Final EIS for the project. To comply with the ACOE position, Westinghouse/Shaw is working around the wetlands in the Cooling Tower area until the Final EIS is approved and a wetlands permit is issued.   This is a focus area.

Appeals of Order No. 2009-104A
 
In May 2009, two intervenors appealed the Commission's Order No. 2009-104A to the South Carolina Supreme Court.  The oral arguments in the appeals brought by Friends of the Earth (FOE) and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee were held on March 4 and April 6, 2010, respectively.  On April 26, 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court, affirmed Commission Order No. 2009-104A in the appeal initiated by FOE.  No petition for rehearing was filed by FOE and the period for filing such a request has closed.  On August 9, 2010, subsequent to this review period, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued the Opinion
discussed above in .  In the Opinion, the Court ruled that capital cost contingencies were not permitted as a part of approved capital cost forecasts under the Base Load Review Act.  The effect of this decision is to remove $438,291,000 in contingency from the capital cost estimates approved in Orders No. 2009-104A and 2010-12. As indicated herein, SCE&G had previously identified the need to expend a net of $83.8 million of that amount over the course of the project to fund base cost increases and to meet timing issues related to cash flows in various years.  The court's decision left open to SCE&G the option to petition the Commission to update the cash flow projection.  The Base Load Review Act requires such updates to be allowed unless the cost changes are proven to be the result of imprudence by the utility.
South Carolina Energy Users Comm. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Comm'n
 
On May 28, 2010, SCE&G had filed a request for revised rates to reflect in rates the revenues determined by applying SCE&G's cost of capital to the outstanding balance of CWIP on the Units as of June 30, 2010.  On August 11, 2010, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff sent a letter to the Commission indicating that in light of the Opinion, $2,277,000 of contingency costs that were included in construction work in progress during the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2010 should be removed from consideration in establishing revised rates in the May 28, 2010 request. The rate impact of this adjustment is $270,000 which results in a final revenue requirement under the request of $47,301,000.  On August 11, 2010, SCE&G wrote to the Commission indicating that it was voluntarily incorporating ORS's adjustment in its revised rates request while reserving the right to seek revision of its cost estimate and recovery of the capital cost associated with the identified amount in subsequent revised rates filings.

Standard Plant Design Activities
 
During the reporting period, the following standard plant design activities were conducted:
 
a)
                                     
Squib Valve prototype testing was completed in June 2010. Subsequent to this reporting period, the final design review was completed on July 14, 2010 with no significant issues remaining. NND Engineering personnel attended this design review.
 
b)
                                     
During the testing of the Reactor Cooling Pump (RCP) for the China AP1000 projects, the RCP exhibited a problem during coast down from full speed.  Several indications were discovered that warranted a root cause analysis which was performed by WEC and the manufacturer, EMD.  Detailed plans have been formulated for material changes, design changes for internal components and additional developmental testing.  A second diagnostic test was completed after which detailed inspections of the parts of the Kingsbury bearing used in these pumps were performed. EMD is evaluating the data to determine whether any changes to main components of the Kingsbury bearing are required for the third diagnostic test scheduled to begin in October 2010. The corrective action effort and final testing are expected to be completed within the original test schedule.  There is no known adverse impact on the project schedule for Units 2 and 3 from this activity.  This continues to be a focus area.
 
c)
                                     
WEC has been tracking the design finalization schedule for major engineering categories and flagging items where design finalization is below WEC expectations related to support of the China AP1000 projects.  However, the Consortium is moving toward a site-specific need-based schedule for Issued For Construction (IFC).  These are the drawings needed for the development of work packages for construction. The completion of IFC drawings is based on the finalization of design. This change may take several months to implement. SCE&G supports this change and will keep ORS informed on the progress of the shift and the progress of design finalization. This tracking mechanism will be a more meaningful indication of the project needs and status of the work. The WEC design finalization continues to support the respective Substantial Completion dates for VCS Units 2 and 3.
 
3.
                                     
Site Specific Design Activities
 
a)
                                     
Shaw Engineering continues to perform Site Specific Design work to support the permitting and licensing activities.
b)
                                     
Design continues for Site Specific Systems, to include the Circulating Water System, Yard Fire System, Potable Water System, Raw Water System, Sanitary Drain System and Waste Water System, and the Switchyard.  This work is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.

Procurement/Fabrication Update
 
Several important developments have occurred as a result of deficiencies that have been found in the quality assurance programs that apply to this project through NRC regulation and the EPC Contract.  Through the evaluation and auditing of suppliers' QA programs, WEC/Shaw has identified QA deficiencies at Shaw Module Solutions and Mangiarotti, which involve deficiencies in procedures and documentation.  These deficiencies do not appear to have affected workmanship of the products being manufactured. SCE&G is closely monitoring the corrective actions being taken.
 
1.
                                     
Production of the CA20 structural sub-modules at the Shaw Module Solutions (SMS) facility has progressed intermittently due to problems in the design package and fabrication procedures. Resident technical support personnel from WEC and Shaw Nuclear have been assigned to the SMS facility to expedite the incorporation of design documents into the fabrication work packages. Subsequent to this reporting period, NND Engineering and QA personnel participated in a review of the SMS fabrication process the during week of July 19, 2010 along with Shaw Nuclear QA personnel who led a QA audit of the SMS fabrication process. As a result of the QA audit, Shaw Nuclear issued a Stop Work Order to SMS on July 23, 2010 for all safety related assembly and welding activities related to welding procedures and production travelers. Cause and corrective actions are being assessed, as well as the production schedule impact. The NRC is aware of these SMS issues and plan to visit the SMS facility the week of August 9, 2010. It is noted that the subject Stop Work Order was lifted on August 6, 2010. However this will remain a focus area.
 
2.
                                     
Doosan had experienced delays in the fabrication of the Reactor Vessel for Unit 2.  After a comprehensive review, Doosan determined that the delays resulted primarily from Doosan's scheduling of manufacturing process and the failure to optimize it.  The Doosan recovery plan includes an optimization of the fabrication process with emphasis on the welding sequence.  Also, Doosan agreed to give first priority to the AP1000 project where there are conflicts with domestic South Korean projects.  Doosan also continues to hold daily "tool box meetings" and monitor the Reactor Vessel nozzle welding program for its subcontractor PCI. Doosan continues to implement a Total Operational Excellence program and closely monitor the manufacturing process. The "Reactor Vessel Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Outlet Nozzle Welding to Flange Nozzle Shell
Completion Unit 2" is a BLRA milestone and continues to be six months behind the BLRA milestone completion date. This delay does not appear to adversely impact the receipt of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel on site (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-6).
 
As reported in the last quarterly report, Doosan reported that inspections had discovered a crack in the forging for the Unit 2 2B Steam Generator channel head. This forging was scrapped and a cause and corrective action review performed. The current forging passed the in-process Ultrasonic Test (UT) with no indications found. Doosan plans to perform two more UTs on this forging throughout fabrication.  The schedule impact continues to be assessed with no apparent impact on the next associated milestone, which is the milestone for Contractor Acceptance of the Steam Generator Equipment at the Port of Entry (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-2).  As noted in the previous quarterly report, the SCE&G NND Engineering Manager and NND QA representative visited the Doosan shop in South Korea during the week of April 26, 2010 to review this issue.  This is a focus area.
 
3.
                                     
All hollow forgings were completed for the Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Reactor Coolant Loop (RCL) Piping hot legs.  This work is being performed by IBF, a subcontractor to Tioga.  Both companies are located in Italy. Subsequent to the hollow forging, and consistent with its quality assurance plan, IBF discovered that the grain size for the 2B RCL hot leg pipe was unacceptable.  This forging was scrapped and a new forging was produced. The Unit 2 forgings are in the latheing process. Preliminary inspections have been performed on the forgings and found to be acceptable. Additional inspections will be made.  There is no apparent impact to the shipment of the Unit 2 RCL piping to the site (BLRA milestone 11-4Q-5).  This condition occurred subsequent to this reporting period.
 
4.
                                     
As a result of a QA audit by WEC of Mangiarotti, WEC has invoked a manufacturing hold on Mangiarotti's production and fabrication of AP1000 components being manufactured for the US domestic market.  The WEC audit resulted in significant deficiencies being identified in the Mangiarotti QA program. Cause and corrective action is being assessed as well as project schedule impact. The BLRA milestones potentially impacted are 09-2Q-3 "Core Makeup Tank Fabricator Notice to Contractor Receipt of Long Lead Material  Units 2 & 3," 10-2Q-3 "Contractor Notified that Pressurizer Fabricator Performed Cladding on Bottom Head  Unit 2," 11-3Q-3 "Pressurizer Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Welding of Upper and Intermediate Shells Completion  Unit 2," 12-1Q-2 "Passive Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Final Post Weld Heat Treatment  Unit 2."
5.
                                     
A Stop Work Order was issued by WEC on June 15, 2010 for the lack of documentation certifying the Passive Regenerative Heat Removal (PRHR) Heat Exchanger Tubing supplied by Valinox, a sub-supplier for Mangiarotti. Subsequent to this reporting period, this Stop Work Order was partially lifted, allowing Valinox, to proceed with manufacturing activities for the tubing. However, the tubing may not be released to Mangiarotti until the items listed in the revised restart criteria are completed.
 
6.
                                     
A Stop Work Order was issued by WEC because of an issue with the PRHR tube to tube sheet connection in order to ensure proper protection against the ingress of borated water in a crevice that may exist in the connection. The engineering evaluation was completed that resulted in a decision to use the mechanical rolling process to establish the connection. The Stop Work Order was lifted on July 1, 2010 subsequent to this reporting period although the general manufacturing hold referenced in item 4 remains in place.
 
7.
                                     
The fabrication of the remainder major components is generally making progress as planned.

MB Kahn, as contractor for the Nuclear Learning Center expansion, continues with roofing and dry-in work. In addition, MB Kahn is erecting steel on the Module Assembly Building (MAB).
 
9.
                                           
The foundation work for the Heavy Lift Derrick (HLD) continues under a Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) issued by SCE&G. Per the LNTP, this work is Shaw's responsibility at their financial risk pending resolution of the HLD commercial issue. Subsequent to this reporting period on August 10, 2010, SCE&G and the Consortium signed an agreement that will move target priced scopes of work to the fixed/firm categories for which the HLD is a part. This resolves the HLD commercial issue.
 
E.
                                     
Training Update
 
1.
                                     
The initial group of thirteen (13) Reactor Operator Training Instructors completed the reactor operations system training subsequent to this reporting period with the second group receiving this training beginning September 2010. The Reactor Operator Training Instructors will receive their reactor operations simulator training in 2011 and 2012.
 
2.
                                     
The renovation of the VCS Unit 1 Nuclear Learning Center (NLC) continues in order to house the AP1000 reactor operator training simulators. The current training facility at the NLC is being expanded to accommodate the two limited scope simulators for Units 2 and 3 that will arrive onsite in 2012.

Change Control/Owners Cost Forecast Update
 
1.
                                     
Contract Amendment #1 has been approved by SCE&G senior management for final approval and transmitted to WEC/Shaw subsequent to this reporting period.  The EPC Contract revisions in this Amendment represent updates, such as contract language clarifications in the sections relating to Changes in the Work, changes made to the Major Equipment Supplier and Contractor exhibits and changes in the milestone payment schedules due to the Performance Management Baseline Schedule received on April 1, 2009. There is
an increase in the EPC Contract price due to Change Order 1 (Limited Scope Simulator) which is included in this Amendment.
 
2.
                                     
SCE&G continues to update its forecast of Owner's Costs to reflect increases in the anticipated costs of project oversight and operations staffing, licensing and other items.  SCE&G will continue to review and update these cost projections.  The most recent updates have resulted in an increase in the forecast of Owner's Costs.
 
3.
                                     
Change Order No. 1 for the training of the Reactor Operator Training Instructors by WEC was modified by Change Order No. 5 in four areas to include: schedule, location, class sequencing and simulator capability as a result of the schedule shift. This results in an increased cost to SCE&G to be covered by the Time & Material allocation as part of the EPC Contract. There will be no increase to the EPC Contract price.
 
4.
                                     
Change Order No. 4 for the transfer of the module fabrication and site assembly scope of work from WEC to Shaw has been on hold pending final negotiation and agreement of the Target work scope and associated dollar shift to the Fixed/Firm price category. This change order is a "no cost" change order and will not change the EPC Contract price. Subsequent to this reporting period, the Target to Fixed/Firm scope and dollar shift was approved by SCE&G and the Consortium per a signed Agreement dated August 10, 2010. Change Order No. 4 will be voided and replaced with a new Change Order that will incorporate the terms of the approved Agreement.
 
5.
                                     
Change Order No. 6 was approved subsequent to this reporting period to substitute hydraulic nuts in place of the AP1000 Standard Plant Reactor Vessel stud tensioners and conventional Reactor Vessel closure head nuts. This Change Order does not impact the EPC Agreement price or project schedule.
 
6.
                                     
Change Order No. 7 was approved subsequent to this reporting period for additional engineering work necessary for the relaying carrier frequencies for the St. George Transmission lines at the Unit 2 Switchyard. This resulted in an increase to the EPC Contract price and the use of contingency dollars.
 
7.
                                     
Also, on August 10, 2010, SCE&G (for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper), and WEC/Shaw agreed to shift significant additional portions of the EPC Contract components from the "target" category to the "fixed cost" and "fixed cost with escalation" categories. As a result of this agreement, approximately two-
 
thirds of the total EPC Contract costs are now in the fixed cost and fixed cost with escalation categories.
 
8.
                                     
The change in cash flow forecast related to all change orders to date and changes in Owner's Costs is forecast to be $81.3 million in 2007 dollars, the largest component of which is the change in Owner's Cost. The $81.3 million cost change is reflected in the cash flow projections contained in the exhibits to this Quarterly Report.

Transmission Update
 
1.
                                      
SCE&G's Power Delivery group continues with the transmission line siting process for determining the precise routes for the new VC Summer Unit 1  Killian 230kV line, the VC Summer Unit 2  Lake Murray #2 230kV line, and the VC Sumer Unit 3  St. George #1 and #2 230kV lines.  These new lines are needed to connect the Units to the grid.
 
2.
                                      
The VC Summer Unit 1- Killian line is being sited in three phases: VCS-Winnsboro, Winnsboro-Blythewood, and Blythewood-Killian.  A first public workshop was held on October 29, 2009 to gain public input for the Blythewood-Killian section.  A second public workshop was held on March 16, 2010 to receive public comments on proposed alternate routes for this line.   A final route has been identified and route notification letters have been mailed to all property owners in the study area. For property owners that are adjacent to the selected route, we also included survey notification. The first public workshop for the Winnsboro-Blythewood section was held on April 15, 2010. The 2
nd
 public workshop is expected to be held in October 2010 with final route selection expected by end of 2010. The remaining section (VCS-Winnsboro) will occupy existing right-of-way, and no formal workshops are planned.
 
3.
                                      
For the VC Summer Unit 2  Lake Murray #2 230kV line, SCE&G Power Delivery expects this line route will be constructed entirely within existing rights-of-way.  SCE&G's Power Delivery group has completed an initial inventory survey of one of its existing right-of-way corridors and is in the process of conducting title searches of the existing properties.  Power Delivery has completed the evaluation of a second corridor as part of the process of analyzing and determining a final route for this line.
 
4.
                                      
Power Delivery has completed acquisition of additional land in St. George, South Carolina that will allow for installation of the breaker-and-a-half switchyard configuration needed to connect Unit 3 via two new VC Summer  St. George 230kV lines. SCE&G has investigated the availability of existing rights of way which could minimize the overall siting process for the VC
Summer-St. George 230kV lines. A determination has now been made to utilize existing corridors to the fullest extent possible, thus eliminating or minimizing the need to acquire new or expanded right-of-way.

Anticipated Construction Schedules
 
As of the end of the second quarter of 2010, the Company and its contractors remain on schedule to complete all required milestones as adjusted pursuant to the milestone schedule contingencies approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A.  Each of those adjustments is itemized in the Milestone Update section that follows.  Accordingly, the project is in compliance with the construction schedules approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12 and with the provisions of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-275(A)(1).
 
A.
                                   
Construction Schedule Update
 
The Project Licensing and Permitting, Engineering, Procurement and Construction work remains on schedule to meet the Units 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates. Rescheduling of the milestones is addressed in Section III.B herein.  The rescheduling of these milestones is within the approved contingencies and has no adverse impact on the Units' Substantial Completion dates.
 
B.
                                   
Milestone Update
 
Attached as to this quarterly report is a spreadsheet that lists and updates each of the specific milestones constituting the anticipated construction schedule for the Units pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B)(1) and Order No. 2010-12. Comparing the milestone dates in this quarter to the reset milestone dates in Order No. 2010-12, 30 milestones have been advanced and 20 have been delayed.  All milestones adjustments are within the scope of the milestone schedule contingency authorized by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A. The milestone adjustments do not adversely affect the Substantial Completion dates for Units 2 and 3.

Schedules of the Capital Costs Incurred Including Updates to the Information Required by S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B)(6) (the Inflation Indices)
 
The Capital Cost Update section of this report provides an update of the cumulative capital costs incurred and forecasted to be incurred in completing the project.  These costs are compared to the cumulative capital cost targets approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates, and any use by the Company of the cost and timing contingencies that were approved by the Commission in Order No.
2009-104A.  The Inflation Adjustments and Indices section of this report provides updated information on inflation indices and the changes in them.
 
A.
                                   
Capital Costs Update
 
When adjusted for escalation, the year-end 2010 Cumulative Project Cash Flow as approved in Order No. 2010-12 is $939.0 million (including contingencies).  The current forecast of the Revised Cumulative Project Cash Flow, as of December 31, 2010, shows that SCE&G will have spent $960.2 on the project by that date.  This amount includes the actual and forecasted commitment of $17.2 million in contingency funds in 2010 and the commitment of $1.1 million of contingency funds during past periods.  It also includes uncommitted contingency funds of $60.4 million.  As discussed above, these figures include the $438 million contingency fund.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has determined that the contingency fund was inappropriately included in the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act.  Adjusted figures will be supplied in future filings.  Accordingly, the approved capital cost forecasts for the project will not include contingency funds going forward.
 
The forecasted expenditure for the project in 2010 exclusive of AFUDC is $497.6 million.  As shown on the cumulative amount to be spent on the project as of December 31, 2010 is forecasted to be approximately $20.8 million greater than the Cumulative Project Cash Flow approved by the Commission for year-end 2010 as adjusted for inflation and Westinghouse/Shaw billing differences.  The $20.8 million difference in Cumulative Project Cash Flow as compared to target represents timing differences and not changes in underlying costs.
Appendix 2, Chart B, line 32,
 
Chart A
of shows the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target as approved in Order No. 2010-12 and as updated for escalation and other Commission approved adjustments under the heading   As shown there, SCE&G had carried forward into 2010 $36.8 million in unused contingency funds from 2009 as permitted by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104A. As discussed above, these contingency funds are no longer to be included in Commission approved capital cost forecasts.   SCE&G has not used the capital cost schedule contingencies to make any adjustments to the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow as set forth in this filing because the project conforms to approved project cost targets without such adjustments.  Nonetheless, SCE&G does not intend to waive or in any way limit its right, as authorized by the Commission, to make appropriate capital cost contingency adjustments associated with past or future changes in cost scheduling.  SCE&G may make capital cost contingency adjustments related to such changes in its scheduling of capital costs in future filings.

Inflation Indices Update
 
Appendix 4
shows the updated inflation indices approved in Order No. 2009-104A.  Included is a history of the annual Handy Whitman All Steam Index, South Atlantic Region; the Handy Whitman All Steam and Nuclear Index, South Atlantic Region; Handy Whitman All Transmission Plant Index, South Atlantic Region; and the Chained GDP Index for the past 10 years.  The changes in these indices and the escalation-related effects of cost rescheduling resulted in a decrease in the projected cost of the Units in future dollars from $6.9 billion as forecast in Order No. 2010-12 to a forecast of $6.2 billion using current inflation data and the current AFUDC rate.

Conclusion
 
As indicated above, the scheduled completion dates for Units 2 & 3 remain April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  The Units are on track to be completed within the originally projected cost of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars net of AFUDC but present capital cost projections show that the Company will need to obtain Commission approval for additional expenditures above the $4.1 billion amount net of contingencies.  The Company maintains an extensive staff of experts that monitors and oversees the work of its contractors and has identified and continues to monitor closely all areas of concerns related to either cost or schedule for the project.  The Company will continue to update the Commission and ORS of progress and concerns as the project proceeds.

Appendix 2, Chart A
is an updated and expanded version of the information contained in the capital cost schedule approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12. 
As discussed above, these figures include the $438 million contingency fund.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has determined that the contingency fund was inappropriately included in the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. Adjusted figures will be supplied in future filings.
