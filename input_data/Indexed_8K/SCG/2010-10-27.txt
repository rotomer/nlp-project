Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Cayce, SC, October 27, 2010...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced financial results for the period ended September 30, 2010 and reaffirmed 2010 guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 per share.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2010, SCANA reported basic earnings per share of 80 cents, or $101 million, compared to 84 cents per share, or $103 million for the same earnings period in 2009.
 
"The decline in third quarter results was due primarily to resolution of a state income tax issue in 2009, which contributed 11 cents per share," said Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The earnings drivers for the third quarter were improved electric margins resulting from electric base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the retail electric rate case, which offset higher interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher operations and maintenance expenses and dilution during this quarter."
 
Addison also noted that this was the first quarter that included the new electric weather normalization adjustment mechanism (WNA).
"On a prospective basis, with WNA in effect in our regulated operations at SCE&G and the Customer Utilization Tracker at PSNC Energy, about 90% of our earnings are more predictable for our shareholders and the effects of abnormal weather on customer's bills are mitigated."
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, SCANA reported basic earnings of $2.25 per share, or $281 million, compared to $2.23 per share, or $272 million, for the same period in 2009.
 
"
The year-to-date increase in earnings was driven primarilyby improved electric and gas margins due to regulatory outcomes and customer growth.  These improvements were offset by higher interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher operation and maintenance expenses and dilution, as well as the effect of the resolution of the state income tax issue in 2009," said Addison.
 
 
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
 
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
 
Reported earnings in the third quarter of 2010 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G) were $111 million, or 87 cents per share (basic), compared to $109 million, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2009.  The decrease was due to the resolution in 2009 of the state tax issue related to State of South Carolina Economic Impact Zone (EIZ) Tax Credits, higher interest expense, higher property taxes, higher operations and maintenance expenses and dilution, which more than offset higher electric and gas margins. At September 30, 2010, SCE&G was serving approximately 660,000 electric customers and approximately 309,000 natural gas customers, both up approximately 1 percent over a year earlier.
 
PSNC Energy
 
PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported a seasonal loss of $5 million, or 4 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2010, unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2009. At September 30, 2010, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 468,000 customers, an increase of 1.6 percent over a year earlier.
 
SCANA Energy  Georgia
 
SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a loss of $3 million, or 2 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2010, unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2009. At September 30, 2010, SCANA Energy was serving more than 445,000 customers, an increase of approximately 1 percent over a year earlier.
 
Corporate and Other, Net
 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported a loss in the third quarter of 2010 of $2 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to earnings of $1 million, or 1 cent per share in the same quarter last year.  The results for 2010 reflect slightly higher interest expense and income taxes than the same period in 2009.
 
UPDATE ON ANNUAL BLRA RATE PROCEEDING
 
On September 30, 2010 the South Carolina Public Service Commission approved SCE&G's annual Revised Rate Adjustment request for the annual recovery of financing costs related to its new nuclear construction. This rate adjustment was based upon the incremental project construction work in progress incurred from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010 and the updated capital structure with the return on equity set at 11 percent.  The approved increase of $47.3 million, or 2.3 percent, will be effective for bills rendered on or after October 30th of this year.
 
EARNINGS OUTLOOK
 
The Company reaffirmed its guidance for 2010 basic earnings per share of $2.90 to $3.05. These estimates exclude any potential impacts from changes in accounting principles and gains or losses
 
from certain investing activities, litigation and sales of assets. Other factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement. The Company continues to target an average annual earnings growth rate of 4 to 6 percent over the next 3 to 5 years.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING INFORMATION
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
(Millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited)
 
 
Note (1): In the first quarter of 2010, pursuant to authorization by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina in connection with its annual review of fuel cost and rates, the Company accelerated the recognition of previously deferred state income tax credits in the amount of $17 million (thereby lowering income tax expense), and recorded an offsetting reduction of 2010's recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue).  These offsetting decreases had no effect on income available to common shareholders.

During periods when the average market price of SCANA's common stock is above the per share adjusted forward sales price, the Company computes diluted earnings per share giving effect to this dilutive potential common stock utilizing the treasury stock method.
