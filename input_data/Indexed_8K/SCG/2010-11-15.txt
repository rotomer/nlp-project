Introduction and Summary
 
A.
                                   
Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company ("SCE&G" or "Company") to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the "Commission") and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff ("ORS").  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2009) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104(A).  This report provides updated information concerning the status of the construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station Units 2 & 3 (the "Units") and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units as approved in Order No. 2009-104(A) and Order No. 2010-12.  Order No. 2009-104(A) is the base load review order related to the Units that was issued by the Commission on February 27, 2009.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules and construction milestone schedules for the Units in Order No. 2010-12.
 
On August 9, 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued its opinion in , 388 S.C. 486, 697 S.E.2d 587 (2010) (the "Opinion").  In the Opinion, the Court ruled that capital cost contingencies were not permitted as a part of approved capital cost forecasts under the Base Load Review Act until costs could be identified, itemized and designated to specific cost items.  The Supreme Court's decision left open to SCE&G the option to petition the Commission to update the approved cash flow projections for the project to reclassify contingent costs to specific cost items.  The Base Load Review Act requires such updates to be allowed unless the changes in the cash flow projections are proven to be the result of imprudence by the utility.   In response to the Supreme Court's Opinion, the financial information presented in this filing is net of the $438,291,000 in contingency funds that the Commission approved in Orders No. 2009-104(A) and 2010-12.  Simultaneously with this filing, SCE&G is submitting a request to the Commission under S.C. Code Ann. 58-33-270(E) to reclassify approximately $174 million in costs from the previously approved contingency amounts to specific cost items in the capital cost forecast.  Under the Base Load Review Act, the Commission will have six months to consider this request.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current construction milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104(A).  There are 146 separate milestones.  Of these, 54 have been completed as of September 30, 2010.  Comparing the milestone completion dates for this quarter to the milestone dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 51 milestones have changed.  Of these, 30 have been accelerated and 21 have been delayed for between one and ten months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
As this report indicates, the Company is on track to complete the Units at the original construction cost forecast of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars net of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC") and including the $438 million contingency that was approved in Order 2009-104(A).  However, the current capital cost forecast of approximately $4.3 billion is $174 million higher than the approved capital
 
cost schedule when the $438 million in contingency funds are removed.  As mentioned above, simultaneously with this filing, SCE&G is submitting a petition to the Commission under S.C. Code Ann. 58-33-270(E) to reclassify $174 million in costs from the previously approved contingency to specific cost items in the capital cost forecast.
 
In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission recognized that forecasts of AFUDC expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  New escalation indices were issued in November for the period January-June of 2010 and those indices have been used in recalculating and re-forecasting project costs.  below shows the forecasted construction cost for the project in 2007 dollars reflecting the current cost projections and the effects of current escalation rates.  The capital cost forecast submitted in the second quarter 2010 monthly report included approximately $81 million in capital costs that the Company had reclassified from contingency into itemized cost categories.  Chart A shows that SCE&G has reclassified approximately $93 million in capital costs since the second quarter 2010 monthly report for an aggregate change of $174 million in the capital cost forecast excluding contingency that was approved in Orders No. 2009-104(A) and 2010-12

These figures do not include contingencies.
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including current escalation, to the forecast on which the Commission relied in adopting Order No. 
2010-12 excluding the $438 million contingency fund and associated escalation, and adjusted to reflect current escalation rates.  This chart shows that, while the anticipated cost of the plant in 2007 dollars is $174 million more than the approximately $4.1 billion cost without contingency, the reduction in the construction cost forecast is largely due to the changes in forecasted escalation rates when netted against other changes as discussed more fully below.

These figures do not include contingencies.
 
Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104(A), the most current twelve-month inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  As stated above, new escalation indices were issued in November for the period January-June of 2010 and those rates are reflected in this report.
 
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have begun to drop.  The current one-year averages and five-year averages are now closer to historical ten year rates than they have been in certain past periods.  Current escalation rates are shown on , below.

Increased AFUDC(1)
 
The change in AFUDC for the project is currently projected to be $19.1 million higher than the forecast on which Order No. 2010-12 was based when adjusted to remove the $438 million contingency.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104(A), SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress ("CWIP") that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's AFUDC rate is currently 7.10% compared to the rate of 5.87% that applied when Order 2010-12 was issued.  Standing alone, this increase in the AFUDC rate would increase the forecasted amount of AFUDC by $47.7 million. However, lower escalation rates have reduced the forecasted project cash flows thereby reducing AFUDC by $28.6 million to produce a $19.1 million net forecasted increase in AFUDC for the project.
 
(1)  All AFUDC calculations contained in this section reflect the removal of the $438 million contingency fund from the cash flow forecast.

Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
Order No. 2009-104(A) established the Cumulative Project Cash Flow listed on Exhibit F to the Combined Application as the target for measuring the compliance of the project with the cost-related terms of that order.  Order No. 2010-12 updated Exhibit F to conform to the Performance Management Baseline Schedule provided by Westinghouse/Shaw on April 1, 2009. In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data and any use by the Company of the capital cost schedule contingencies that the Commission approved in Order No. 2009-104(A).  As discussed above, in compliance with the Supreme Court's opinion, all the figures presented in these charts are now net of the $438 million contingency fund that the Commission approved in Order No. 2009-104(A).
 
Appendix 2, Chart A
provides the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up to June 30, 2010 have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates up to that date.  The cash flow targets for the third quarter of 2010 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices which for purposes of this report are the indices provided in November of 2010 that are current through June 30, 2010.  When actual indices for the period July 1, 2010 to September 30, 2010 become available, the 2010 cash flow data for the categories that are subject to indexed escalation will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2, Chart B
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the figures presented on for 2009 and 2010 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order 2009-104(A).  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, Westinghouse/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments in the following period to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to to offset the timing difference related to Westinghouse/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits which applies to those EPC cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.  As shown on the total amount of the resulting adjustment for 2009 has been updated to $1.7 million based on actual escalation rates and the adjustment for the first nine months of 2010 is calculated to be ($9.7) million.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Construction of the project is progressing on schedule to meet the Unit 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates of April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  A summary of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.
 
A.
                                   
Licensing and Permitting Update
 
1.
                                     
The Combined Operating License Application (COLA)
 
The COLA review process continues.  Westinghouse intends to file with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) a Design Control Document (DCD) revision, DCD Revision 18.  DCD Revision 18 will incorporate all of the responses to NRC questions pertaining to the Shield Building design (DCD Revision 17) and all of the updates to other design matters that have been requested as part of the COLA review process and that are not part of prior amendments.  In light of its assessment of the anticipated schedule for review and approval of DCD Revision 18, SCE&G currently believes that the Combined Operating License (COL) for Units 2 & 3 will be issued in late 2011 or early 2012.  SCE&G is reviewing the project schedule impact and will continue to carefully monitor and proactively manage this aspect of the COL schedule.  The status of the major COLA review areas is as follows:
 
a)
                                     
Nuclear Safety Review
 
The Staff of the NRC has completed its Phase 1 review to support development of the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the Units, which includes the COLA review and issuance of NRC Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) to SCE&G for resolution.  The Phase 2 review continues with SCE&G responding to NRC questions.  The Phase 2 review of the SER is intended to result in the development of the SER with no open items.
 
The NRC continues the SER review of the DCD-17.  Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC), SCE&G and the industry are working with the NRC to resolve the open items associated with the NRC approval of DCD-17.  A letter received from the NRC on October 29, 2010 shows the issuance of a final SER in June 2011 and supports the issuance of a COL for the Units in the late 2011 to early 2012 timeframe.
 
SCE&G is closely monitoring the DCD-17 review process because of its potential impact on the schedule for the review and approval of the COLA for the Units.  SCE&G has identified the status of the review and approval of
DCD-17 as a focus area for on-going monitoring and attention to ensure that WEC does what is required to obtain the necessary approvals on a timely basis.
 
The first Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) meeting to review the majority of the siting characteristics for the VCSNS Units 2 and 3 site was conducted on July 21 and 22, 2010. No significant issues were identified. This was a significant technical milestone for the project. The second ACRS subcommittee meeting in which the wet-bulb exemption request, hydrology and emergency planning will be discussed is currently scheduled for December 17, 2010.
 
b)
                                     
Environmental Review
 
In July 2009, the NRC completed the Phase I scoping of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Units.  All Environmental Report RAIs and follow-up questions have been answered.  The NRC issued the draft EIS on April 15, 2010 to which SCE&G has responded.  A letter from the NRC dated October 29, 2010 shows the issuance of the final EIS in April 2011.  This schedule supports the issuance of a COL for the Units in the late 2011 to early 2012 time frame.
 
c)
                                     
Legal Review
 
As noted previously, several parties sought to intervene to raise issues before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) in its review of SCE&G's COLA and their interventions were dismissed either because their contentions were deemed not to be admissible, or because they lacked standing.  The intervenors appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC.
 
On January 7, 2010, the NRC issued a ruling that affirmed the ASLB's decision but required the ASLB to review on a factual basis the intervenors' contention related to Demand Side Management (DSM) programs.  In rejecting the intervenors' DSM challenge, the ASLB had relied on a 2005 NRC decision holding that DSM matters were not relevant to the need for power determination in nuclear licensing.  The NRC directed the ASLB to reconsider the intervenors' DSM contention on the facts.
 
On March 17, 2010, the ASLB considered the merits of the intervenors' DSM contentions and issued an order rejecting all contentions of the intervenors.  The intervenors appealed the ASLB order on remand to the NRC.  On August 27, 2010, the NRC affirmed the ASLB order regarding the challenged DSM contention.

Other Permits
 
a)
                                     
SCDHEC Permits
 
i.
                                         
SCE&G received the SCDHEC Phase 6 Stormwater permit # SCR10N068 which allows clearing and grading of the roadway and area for the Wastewater Line to the Discharge Structure in Parr Reservoir.
 
ii.
                                      
SCE&G received from Norfolk Southern/AECOM a permit to make a Utility Railroad Crossing under an existing rail spur line between Unit 1 and the Unit 2/3 Table Top Area.
 
iii.
                                   
SCE&G received the General Conditional Major Operating Permit (GCMP-04) "Concrete Batch Plants" from SCDHEC (Permit # GCM04-1000-0036).
 
iv.
                                  
SCE&G received SCDHEC Construction Permit # 19422-IW for the construction of the Temporary Pump and Haul Facility and Piping for Sewer A (Table Top Area).
 
b)
                                     
Corps of Engineers Wetlands Permit
 
SCE&G continues to interface with the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) on the ACOE 404 (wetlands) permit for construction work on the site and submitted the draft permit during the 1
st
 Quarter 2010. There is only one wetland area on the site that is of concern.  It is located near the Cooling Towers area and is very limited in size.  The permit application related to this area was noticed for public comment in April 2010 with the comment period ending on July 9, 2010. Several commenting agencies made comments related to their concerns about the lack of specific transmission line routing data related to the off-site transmission lines to be constructed to integrate the Units into the grid.  SCE&G and the ACOE have a path forward.  A revised ACOE permit will be submitted by the end of November 2010.
 
The ACOE has taken the position that it will not issue a wetlands permit for this area until the NRC issuance of the Final EIS for the project. To comply with the ACOE position, Westinghouse/Shaw is working around the wetlands in the Cooling Tower area until the Final EIS is approved and a wetlands permit is issued.  This is a focus area.
 
3.
                                           
Appeals of Order No. 2009-104(A)
 
In May 2009, two intervenors appealed the Commission's Order No. 2009-104(A) to the South Carolina Supreme Court.  The oral arguments in the appeals brought by Friends of the Earth (FOE) and the South Carolina Energy Users
Committee were held on March 4 and April 6, 2010, respectively.  On April 26, 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed Commission Order No. 2009-104(A) in the appeal initiated by FOE.  No petition for rehearing was filed by FOE and the period for filing such a request has closed.  On August 9, 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued the Opinion discussed above in ., 388 S.C. 486, 697 S.E.2d 587 (2010).  In the Opinion, the Court ruled that capital cost contingencies were not permitted as a part of approved capital cost forecasts under the Base Load Review Act.  The effect of this decision is to remove $438,291,000 in contingency from the capital cost estimates approved in Orders No. 2009-104(A) and 2010-12.  As indicated above, SCE&G had previously identified the need to expend a net of $81.3 million of that amount over the course of the project to fund base cost increases.  The Supreme Court's decision left open to SCE&G the option to petition the Commission to update the cash flow projection.  The Base Load Review Act requires such updates to be allowed unless the changes in cash flow projections are proven to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  Such a request is being filed contemporaneously with this quarterly report.

Revised Rates Order
 
On May 28, 2010, SCE&G had filed a request for revised rates to reflect in rates the revenues determined by applying SCE&G's cost of capital to the outstanding balance of CWIP on the Units as of June 30, 2010.  On August 11, 2010, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff sent a letter to the Commission indicating that in light of the Opinion, $2,277,000 of contingency costs that were included in construction work in progress during the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2010 should be removed from consideration in establishing revised rates in the May 28, 2010 request. The rate impact of this adjustment is $270,000 which results in a final revenue requirement under the request of $47,301,000.  On August 11, 2010, SCE&G wrote to the Commission indicating that it was voluntarily incorporating ORS's adjustment in its revised rates request while reserving the right to seek revision of its cost estimate and recovery of the capital cost associated with the identified amount in subsequent revised rates filings.  On September 30, 2010, the Commission issued Order 2010-625 granting revised rates as requested.

Standard Plant Design Activities
 
During the reporting period, the following standard plant design activities were conducted:
 
a)
                                     
WEC is processing production drawings and design documentation for the Squib Valves to resolve the remaining open items to support NRC closeout.
 
b)
                                     
During the testing of the Reactor Cooling Pump (RCP) for the China AP1000 projects, the RCP exhibited a problem during coast down from full speed.  Several indications were discovered that warranted a root cause analysis which was performed by WEC and the manufacturer, EMD.  Detailed plans have been formulated for material changes, design changes for internal components and additional developmental testing.  EMD completed the first phase of the third diagnostic test for the RCP during the week of November 8, 2010.  Preliminary indications are that the testing continues to be successful. Additional testing will follow.  The corrective action effort and final testing are expected to be completed within the original test schedule.  There is no known adverse impact on the project schedule for Units 2 and 3 from this activity.  This continues to be a focus area.
 
c)
                                     
WEC has been tracking the design finalization schedule for major engineering categories and flagging items where design finalization is below WEC expectations related to support of the China AP1000 projects.  However, the Consortium is adopting a site-specific need-based schedule for Certified For Construction (CFC) drawings.  These are the drawings needed for the development of work packages for construction. The completion of CFC drawings is based on the finalization of design.  Gaps have been identified between the construction-need date and anticipated receipt of the applicable design package.  The Consortium management is addressing this issue which is also being closely monitored by SCE&G.  However, the WEC design finalization continues to support the respective Substantial Completion dates for VCS Units 2 and 3.

Procurement/Fabrication Update
 
As discussed below, several important developments have occurred as a result of deficiencies that have been found in the quality assurance (QA) programs that apply to this project through NRC regulation and the EPC Contract.  Through the evaluation and auditing of suppliers' QA programs, WEC/Shaw has identified QA deficiencies at Shaw Module Solutions and Mangiarotti, which involve deficiencies in procedures and documentation.  In addition, workmanship issues have been identified at the SMS facility at Lake Charles, LA pertaining to the fabrication of the module prototype. These deficiencies do not appear to have affected workmanship of the Mangiarotti products being manufactured nor the sub-modules being fabricated for SCE&G.  SCE&G is closely monitoring the corrective actions being taken. Also, WEC structural module design changes are being assessed as to the project schedule impacts as discussed below.
 
1.
                                     
Production of the CA20 structural sub-modules at the Shaw Module Solutions (SMS) facility has progressed intermittently due to problems in the design package and fabrication procedures.  Resident technical support personnel from WEC and Shaw Nuclear have been assigned to the SMS facility to expedite the incorporation of design documents into the fabrication work packages.  NND Engineering and QA personnel participated in a review of the SMS fabrication process the during week of July 19, 2010 along with Shaw Nuclear QA personnel who led a QA audit of the SMS fabrication process.  As a result of the QA audit, Shaw Nuclear issued a Stop Work Order to SMS on July 23, 2010 for all safety related assembly and welding activities related to welding procedures and production travelers.  Cause and corrective actions were assessed, as well as the production schedule impact.  The NRC is aware of these SMS issues and visited the SMS facility on August 10 and 11, 2010.  The subject Stop Work Order was lifted on August 6, 2010.  Workmanship issues have also been identified with the fabrication of the module prototype. There appear to be no workmanship issues associated with the sub-module fabrication for SCE&G.
 
2.
                                     
The shipment of CA20 structural sub-modules to the site will be delayed due to the NRC review of the rebar coupler design for the structural wall sub-modules.  All CA wall sub-modules are on technical hold because of this mechanical rebar coupler design review by the NRC.  Also, WEC is reviewing a design change requested by Shaw to incorporate a leak chase design that allows the modules to be assembled vertically without personnel entry to the interior of the module. In addition, WEC is considering a change in the material used to fabricate structural sub-modules to further strengthen them.  The project schedule impacts for these design changes are being assessed.
 
3.
                                     
Doosan continues with the fabrication of the Reactor Vessel for Unit 2.  The "Reactor Vessel Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Outlet Nozzle Welding to Flange Nozzle Shell Completion Unit 2" (10-3Q-3) is a BLRA milestone and is presently ten months behind the BLRA milestone completion date with a projected completion date of December 31, 2010.   As discussed in previous reports, the work flow scheduling problems that led to this delay have been addressed and resolved.  This delay does not appear to adversely impact the receipt of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel on site (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-6).
 
Doosan had previously reported that inspections had discovered a crack in the forging for the Unit 2 2B Steam Generator channel head.  This forging was scrapped and a cause and corrective action review performed.  The ultrasonic testing for the current forging has been successfully completed.  The schedule impact continues to be assessed with no apparent impact on the next associated milestone, which is the milestone for Contractor Acceptance of the Steam Generator Equipment at the Port of Entry (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-2).
 
4.
                                     
The Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Reactor Coolant Loop (RCL) Piping hot leg manufacturer is making progress with the bending for the HL6 section scheduled for the latter part of October 2010.   Shipment of the Unit 2 RCL piping to the site (BLRA milestone 11-4Q-5) remains well ahead of schedule.
 
5.
                                     
As a result of a QA audit by WEC of Mangiarotti, WEC had previously invoked a manufacturing hold on Mangiarotti's production and fabrication of AP1000 components being manufactured for the US domestic market.  The WEC audit resulted in significant deficiencies being identified in the Mangiarotti QA program. This manufacturing hold was subsequently lifted with work continuing at the date of this report.  The BLRA milestones impacted are as follows, to include the completion date for each: 09-2Q-3 "Core Makeup Tank Fabricator Notice to Contractor Receipt of Long Lead Material  Units 2 & 3" (target completion of 12/31/10 with 1 month delay); 10-2Q-3 "Contractor Notified
that Pressurizer Fabricator Performed Cladding on Bottom Head  Unit 2" (target completion date of 11/30/10 with 0 month delay); 11-3Q-3 "Pressurizer Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Welding of Upper and Intermediate Shells Completion  Unit 2" (target completion date of 3/31/11 with 5 month delay); 12-1Q-2 "Passive Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Final Post Weld Heat Treatment  Unit 2" (target completion date of 1/31/11 with 7 month delay).  The projected completion dates for these milestones are within the BLRA milestone schedule contingency.  Also, the shipment of these components to the site remains on schedule.
 
6.
                                     
The fabrication of the remaining major components is generally making progress as planned.

Change Control/Owners Cost Forecast Update
 
1.
                                     
Contract Amendment #1 was approved.  The EPC Contract revisions in this Amendment represent updates, such as contract language clarifications in the sections relating to Changes in the Work, changes made to the Major Equipment Supplier and Contractor exhibits and changes in the milestone payment schedules due to the Performance Management Baseline Schedule received on
 
April 1, 2009. There is an increase in the EPC Contract price due to Change Order 2 (Limited Scope Simulator) which is included in this Amendment.
 
2.
                                     
As described in more detail in the Request of SCE&G for Updates and Revisions to Schedules which is being filed with the Commission contemporaneously with this quarterly report, SCE&G has continued to update its forecast of Owner's Costs to reflect increases in the anticipated costs of project oversight and operations staffing, licensing and other items and to itemize, designate and reclassify costs in response to the Opinion.  SCE&G will continue to review and update these cost projections going forward.  The most recent updates have resulted in an increase in the forecast of Owner's Costs.
 
3.
                                     
Change Order No. 1 for the training of the Reactor Operator Training Instructors by WEC was modified by Change Order No. 5 in four areas to include: schedule, location, class sequencing and simulator capability as a result of the schedule shift. This results in an increased cost to SCE&G to be covered by the Time & Material allocation which is included as a part of the EPC Contract.  There will be no increase to the EPC Contract price.
 
4.
                                     
Change Order No. 4 for the transfer of the module fabrication and site assembly scope of work from WEC to Shaw had been on hold pending the final agreement concerning the Target work scope and associated dollar shift to the Fixed/Firm price category.  Change Order No. 4 was a "no cost" change order and will not change the EPC Contract price.  The Target to Fixed/Firm scope and dollar shift was approved by SCE&G and the Consortium per a signed Agreement dated August 10, 2010. Change Order No. 4 will be voided and superseded with a new Change Order that will incorporate the terms of the approved Agreement.
 
5.
                                     
Change Order No. 6 was approved to substitute hydraulic nuts in place of the AP1000 Standard Plant Reactor Vessel stud tensioners and conventional Reactor Vessel closure head nuts. This Change Order does not impact the EPC Agreement price or project schedule.
 
6.
                                     
Change Order No. 7 was approved for additional engineering work necessary for the relaying carrier frequencies for the St. George Transmission lines at the Unit 2 Switchyard. This resulted in an increase to the EPC Contract price.
 
7.
                                     
Also, on August 10, 2010, SCE&G (for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper), and WEC/Shaw agreed to shift significant additional portions of the EPC Contract components from the "Target" category to the "Fixed cost" and "Firm cost with escalation" categories. As a result of this agreement, approximately two-
 
thirds of the total EPC Contract costs are now in the fixed cost and Firm cost with escalation categories.
 
8.
                                     
The change in cash flow forecast related to all change orders to date and changes in Owner's Costs including Transmission is forecast to be $174 million in 2007 dollars, the largest component of which is the change in Owner's Cost. The $174 million cost change is reflected in the cash flow projections contained in the exhibits to this Quarterly Report.

Transmission Update
 
1.
                                      
SCE&G's Power Delivery group continues with the transmission line siting process for determining the precise routes for the new VC Summer Unit 1  Killian 230kV line, the VC Summer Unit 2  Lake Murray #2 230kV line, and the VC Summer Unit 3  St. George #1 and #2 230kV lines.  These new lines are needed to connect the Units to the grid.
 
2.
                                      
The VC Summer Unit 1- Killian line is being sited in three phases: VCS-Winnsboro, Winnsboro-Blythewood, and Blythewood-Killian.  A first public workshop was held on October 29, 2009 to gain public input for the Blythewood-Killian section.  A second public workshop was held on March 16, 2010 to receive public comments on proposed alternate routes for this line.   A final route has been identified and route notification letters have been mailed to all property owners in the study area.  For property owners that are adjacent to the selected route, we also included survey notification.  The transmission line centerlines are currently being surveyed.  The first public workshop for the Winnsboro-Blythewood section was held on April 15, 2010.  Since then SCE&G has determined that the line segment from Winnsboro to Blythewood can be built on existing right of way.  A final letter is being written to mail to all property owners within the study area announcing the close out of the siting study based upon the decision to use existing the right-of-way corridor.  No further public workshops are planned.  The remaining section (VCS-Winnsboro) will occupy existing right-of-way, and no formal workshops are planned.
 
3.
                                      
For the VC Summer Unit 2  Lake Murray #2 230kV line, SCE&G Power Delivery expects this line route will be constructed entirely within existing rights-of-way.  SCE&G's Power Delivery group has completed an initial inventory survey of one of its existing right-of-way corridors and is in the process of conducting title searches of the existing properties.  Power Delivery has completed the evaluation of a second corridor as part of the process of analyzing and determining a final route for this line.
4.
                                      
Power Delivery has completed acquisition of additional land in St. George, South Carolina that will allow for installation of the breaker-and-a-half switchyard configuration needed to connect Unit 3 via two new VC Summer  St. George 230kV lines.  SCE&G has investigated the availability of existing rights-of-way which could minimize the overall siting process for the VC Summer-St. George 230kV lines. A determination has now been made to utilize existing corridors to the fullest extent possible, thus eliminating or minimizing the need to acquire new or expanded right-of-way.

Anticipated Construction Schedules
 
As of the end of the second quarter of 2010, the Company and its contractors remain on schedule to complete all required milestones as adjusted pursuant to the milestone schedule contingencies approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104(A).  Each of those adjustments is itemized in the Milestone Update section that follows.  Accordingly, the project is in compliance with the construction schedules approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12 and with the provisions of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-275(A)(1).
 
A.
                                   
Construction Schedule Update
 
The Project Licensing and Permitting, Engineering, Procurement and Construction work remains on schedule to meet the Units 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates. Rescheduling of the milestones is addressed in Section III.B herein.  The rescheduling of these milestones is within the approved contingencies and has no adverse impact on the Units' Substantial Completion dates.

Schedules of the Capital Costs Incurred Including Updates to the Information Required by S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B)(6) (the Inflation Indices)
 
The Capital Cost Update section of this report provides an update of the cumulative capital costs incurred and forecasted to be incurred in completing the project.  These costs are compared to the cumulative capital cost targets approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to remove the $438 million in contingency originally approved by the Commission, and to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates.  There has not been any use by the Company of the capital cost timing contingencies that were approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104(A) but would have been listed here if there had been.  The Inflation Adjustments and Indices section of this report provides updated information on inflation indices and the changes in them.

Conclusion
 
As indicated above, the scheduled completion dates for Units 2 & 3 remain April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  The Units are on track to be completed within the originally projected cost of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars including contingency.  However, present capital cost projections show that the Company will need to obtain Commission approval for additional expenditures above the $4.1 billion amount net of contingencies.  The Company maintains an extensive staff of experts that monitors and oversees the work of its contractors and has identified and continues to monitor closely all areas of concerns related to either cost or schedule for the project.  The Company will continue to update the Commission and ORS of progress and concerns as the project proceeds.
