Item 1.01    ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On January 27, 2011, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), for itself and as agent for South Carolina Public Service Authority (Santee Cooper), and Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) entered into a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services.  Under this alliance arrangement and related contracts, Westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for VC Summer Nuclear Station Units 1, 2 and 3.  Westinghouse will be SCE&Gs exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis.  The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Units 1, 2 and 3 through the year 2033.  SCE&G is dep endent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 passive reactors in Units 2 and 3 in the current and anticipated absence of other commercially viable sources.  Westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to Unit 1 under a services alliance arrangement, and SCE&G has also contracted for Westinghouse to provide similar support services to Units 2 and 3 upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation in 2016 and 2019, respectively.  As previously disclosed, Westinghouse and Stone & Webster, Inc. (a consortium) are also constructing Units 2 and 3 under the terms of an Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract dated May 23, 2008.
