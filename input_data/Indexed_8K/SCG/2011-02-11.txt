Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
 
Cayce, SC, February 11, 2011...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, SCANA reported basic earnings of $376 million or $2.99 per share, compared to $348 million, or $2.85 per share, in 2009.
 
"We are pleased with our 2010 results which were in line with our earnings guidance," said Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Despite a challenging economic environment, SCANA achieved its earnings targets and accomplished significant financial goals including establishment of a new, larger credit facility, achievement of several successful regulatory outcomes, and issuance of one of the largest underwritten equity offerings in our Company's history."
 
Addison added, "The effects of abnormal weather continue to be mitigated by our weather normalization mechanisms at a majority of our regulated operations, resulting in more predictability in both our earnings and customer bills."
 
SCANA's reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $95 million, or 74 cents per share, compared to $76 million, or 62 cents per share, for the same quarter in 2009.
 
"
The earnings drivers for the quarter were improved electric margins resulting from electric base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the retail electric rate case, which offset higher operations and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation expense and share dilution," said Addison.  "We continue to see customer growth in all areas we serve, and we're more optimistic for a sustained economic recovery."
 
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
 
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
 
Reported earnings for 2010 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, were $304 million, or $2.42 per share compared to $279 million, or $2.29 per share, in 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2010, SCE&G reported earnings of $67 million, or 52 cents per share, compared to $49 million, or 39 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2009.  The increase in annual earnings was due to higher margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the retail electric rate case, which more than offset higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation expense.  At year-end 2010, SCE&G was serving approximately 661,000 electric customers and approximately 314,000 natural gas customers, up 0.9 and 1.3 percent, respectively, over 2009.
 
PSNC Energy
 
PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported 2010 earnings of $46 million, or 36 cents per share, compared to $46 million, or 38 cents per share, in 2009.  Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $21 million, or 17 cents per share, compared to $20 million, or 17 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Increases in industrial usage and customer growth were offset by higher interest expense for the year.  At year end, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 482,000 customers, an increase of 1.9 percent over the previous year.
 
SCANA Energy  Georgia
 
SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported 2010 earnings of $31 million, or 24 cents per share, compared to $24 million, or 20 cents per share, in 2009. The increase is attributable to increased throughput due to colder than normal weather and customer growth.  Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $10 million, or 7 cents per share, compared to $9 million, or 7 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2009.  At December 31, 2010, SCANA Energy was serving over 460,000 customers, an increase of approximately 2 percent over the prior year.
 
Corporate and Other, Net
 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported a loss of $4 million, or 3 cents per share in 2010, compared to a loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share in 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2010, these businesses reported a loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share, compared to a loss of $1 million, or 1 cent per share in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The increase is due to higher interest costs at the holding company in 2010.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING INFORMATION
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
(Millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited)
 
 
Note (1): In the first quarter of 2010, pursuant to authorization by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (SCPSC) in connection with its annual review of fuel cost and rates, the Company accelerated the recognition of previously deferred state income tax credits in the amount of $17 million, or 9 cents per share (thereby lowering income tax expense) and recorded an offsetting reduction of 2010's recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue).
Note (2): In January 2010, the SCPSC approved SCE&G's retroactive adoption of updated, lower depreciation rates for its electric operations effective January 1, 2009. The SCPSC also approved SCE&G's request that the credit to depreciation expense resulting from the adoption of these rates be applied to reduce recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue). As such, the Company decreased both depreciation expense and electric revenue by $14 million, or 7 cents per share, in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009.  These offsetting decreases had no impact on 2009 net income.  Fourth quarter 2009 depreciation expense reflects the entire annual impact of these lower depreciation rates.  As a result, depreciation expense is $10 million, or 5 cents per share, lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Note (3): In May 2010, SCANA entered into an equity forward sales agreement.  During periods when the average market price of SCANA's common stock is above the per share adjusted forward sales price, the Company computes diluted earnings per share giving effect to this dilutive potential common stock utilizing the treasury stock method.
