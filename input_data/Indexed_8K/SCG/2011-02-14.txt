Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G or the Company) to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the Commission) and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS).  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2010) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104(A).  This report provides updated information concerning the status of the construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station Units 2 & 3 (the Units) and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units as approved in Order No. 2009-104(A) and Order No. 2010-12.  Order No. 2009-104(A) is the base load review order related to the Units that was issued by the Commission on February 27, 2009.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules and construction milestone schedules for th e Units in Order No. 2010-12.
 
On November 15, 2010, the Company filed with the Commission a Petition for Updates and Revisions to Capital Cost Schedules, in Docket No. 2010-376-E (the Petition).  As set forth on Exhibit 1 to the Petition, the Company has removed $438,291,000 in owner's capital cost contingencies from its cost projections in response to the South Carolina Supreme Court opinion in , 388 S.C. 486, 697 S.E.2d 587 (2010) (the Opinion).  In addition, the Company has identified and itemized approximately $174 million in capital costs to specific cost items in the capital cost forecast for the project.  The Petition also updates the cash flow projections for the project to take into account all changes in the timing of cash flow requirements resulting from such things as changes in project construction schedules and shifts in milestone dates.  Under the Base Load Review Act, the Commission will have six months to consider this request.  Under S.C. Code Ann. 58-33-270(E), such updates are allowed unless the changes in the cash flow projections are proven to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  The Petition is discussed more fully below.  The cost projections provided here reflect the cost projections contained in the Petition with updates as described below.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current construction milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104(A).  There are 146 separate milestones.  Of these, 58 have been completed as of December 31, 2010.  Comparing the scheduled milestone completion dates as of the date of this report quarter to the milestone completion dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 72 milestones have changed.  Of these, 30 have been accelerated and 42 have been delayed for between one and nine months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
As this report indicates, the Company is on track to complete the Units at the original construction cost forecast of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars net of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and including the $438 million contingency that was approved in Order 2009-104(A).  However, the current capital cost forecast of
 
approximately $4.3 billion is $174 million higher than the currently-approved capital cost schedule when the $438 million in contingency funds are removed.  In the Petition, SCE&G is requesting that the Commission approve the identification and itemization of $174 million in costs to specific cost items in the capital cost forecast.
In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission recognized that forecasts of AFUDC expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  New escalation indices were issued in November 2010 for the period January-June of 2010 and those indices have been used in forecasting the construction costs for the project presented here.  below compares the current capital cost forecast to the forecast presented in the last quarterly report.  The $13,000 change in capital cost projection reflects the updating of certain change orders that were still under negotiation at the date that the last quarterly report was prepared as well as adjustment to the amount of costs that are not to be shared with project co-owner Santee Cooper.
Chart A
 
 
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including current escalation, to the forecast on which the Commission relied in adopting Order No. 2010-12 excluding the $438 million contingency fund and associated escalation.  The current forecasted capital cost of the plant in 2007 dollars is $174 million more than the previously-approved capital cost of approximately $4.1 billion without contingency.  Nonetheless, due to the changes in forecasted escalation rates when netted against other changes as discussed more fully below the cost of the plant in future dollars has decreased by $401.2 million.
 
 
Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104(A), the most current twelve-month inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  As stated above, new escalation indices were last issued in November 2010 for the period January-June of 2010 and those rates are reflected in this report.
 
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have begun to drop. The current one-year averages and five-year averages are now closer to historical ten year rates than they have been in certain past periods. Current escalation rates are shown on , below.

E.
                                   
AFUDC
 
The change in AFUDC for the project is currently projected to be $28.0 million lower than the forecast on which Order No. 2010-12 was based when that forecast is adjusted to remove the $438 million contingency.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104(A), SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's AFUDC rate for 2011 and beyond is currently 5.87% which happens to be the same rate that was applied when Order No. 2010-12 was issued.  Standing alone, the current AFUDC rate would produce no change in the forecasted amount of AFUDC.  However, lower escalation rates, as partially off-set by the effect of timing changes in the cash flows for the project, as well as the $174 million in recently identi fied and itemized costs, have reduced the forecasted project cash flows for the project thereby producing the forecasted reduction in AFUDC for the project.

Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
The current approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target for the project was adopted by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12. In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data.
 
Appendix 2, Chart A
provides the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data and for the removal of $438 million in owner's contingency costs.  The cash flow targets up to June 30, 2010 have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates up to that date.  The cash flow targets for the third quarter of 2010 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices which for purposes of this report are the indices provided in November of 2010 that are current through June 30, 2010.  When actual indices for the period July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 become available, the 2010 cash flow data for the categories that are subject to indexed escalation will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
Appendix 2, Chart B
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the figures presented on for 2009 and 2010 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement (EPC Contract) and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order 2009-104(A).  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, Westinghouse/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments in the following period to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to to offset the timing difference related to Westinghouse/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits which applies to those EPC cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.  As shown on the total amount of the resulting adjustment for 2009 has been updated to $1.7 million based on actual escalation rates and the adjustment for calendar year 2010 is calculated to be ($9.2) million.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Construction of the project is progressing on schedule to meet the Unit 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates of April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  However, as discussed below, the delay in the schedule for issuance of the Combined Operating License (COL) for the Units will require adjustment to the construction schedule.  In response, SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw have negotiated Change Order 11 to the EPC Contract to provide for Westinghouse/Shaw to perform a COL Delay Impact Study. That study will consider two alternative paths forward to deal with the delay. One scenario compresses the construction schedule to keep the substantial completion date as scheduled, the other delays the substantial completion date for Unit 2 by six months until October 1, 2016.  The study provided for in Change Order 11 is discussed in further detail below.
 
A more detailed summary of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.
 
A.
                                   
Licensing and Permitting Update
 
1.
                                     
The Combined Operating License Application (COLA)
 
a)
                                    
DCD Revisions
 
In 2006, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) gave its initial approval for the Design Control Document (DCD) for the AP1000 reactor.  The
 
approved DCD incorporated amendments to the DCD as originally filed through Revision 15.  Subsequently, Westinghouse filed DCD Revisions 16 and 17 with the NRC.  The design amendments contained in Revisions 16 and 17 improve the ability of the AP1000 Shield Building to withstand aircraft impact and make other amendments to the design.  In December 2010, Westinghouse filed Revision 18 (DCD Rev-18) which incorporates the relevant material from Revisions 16 and 17 and also provides the NRC with Westinghouse's responses to additional questions pertaining to the Shield Building design as well as updates to other design matters that had been requested as part of the review process.
 
In December 2010, the NRC Staff issued a favorable Safety Evaluation Report (SER) on the DCD Rev-18.  In December 2010, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) determined that the AP1000 design is fully adequate to protect public health and safety.  In response, the NRC Staff has provided the NRC Commissioners with the proposed rulemaking package to begin the formal rulemaking process that will result in final approval of the AP1000 design with the amendments subsequent to Revision 15.  Westinghouse has committed that it will provide the NRC with DCD Revision 19 during the first quarter of 2011 which will be a further conforming amendment to the DCD package.  This revision will incorporate into the DCD information Westinghouse previously provided the NRC through Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) thereby making those responses a formal part of the de sign package to be licensed by the NRC.  DCD Revision 19 will also include additional conforming amendments to the design that Westinghouse has agreed to make as a result of the NRC's safety evaluation.
 
Although the ACRS made the determination that the AP1000 design is fully adequate to protect public health and safety as stated above, three "non-concurrences" were filed by NRC staff members.  These non-concurrence filings allow individual NRC staff members to express differences of opinion on technical matters and are recognized as part of the NRC decision making process.  One of the non-concurrences has since been withdrawn.  To date, no further escalation of these issues within the NRC has occurred.
 
In light of these actions, SCE&G anticipates that the NRC will be in a position to approve the amended DCD for the AP1000 reactor in the second half of 2011 which supports issuance of a COL for the Units in late 2011 or early 2012.
b)
                                    
Site-Specific COL and Reference Plant COL
 
As of December 2010, the NRC Staff completed both its Phase A and B reviews to support development of the Advanced Final Safety Evaluation Report (AFSER) for the site-specific COLA for the Units.  The first ACRS
 
subcommittee meeting to review the majority of the siting characteristics for the site of the Units was conducted on July 21 and 22, 2010.  The second ACRS subcommittee meeting to review the remaining site specific information was held January 10 and 11, 2011, subsequent to this reporting period.  No significant issues were identified.  This was a significant technical milestone for the project.  The third, and final, Full ACRS Committee meeting is scheduled for February 10, 2011, at which time a letter is anticipated to be provided by the committee in support of the final application approval process to be conducted by the NRC Commissioners.  The Phase C review is expected to conclude in February 2011 with the completion of the review of the COLA and NRC SER by the ACRS.  If the review is favorable, the ACRS will issue a letter supporting the final COLA approval process by th e NRC.
 
The Reference Plant COL application was submitted to the NRC by Southern Nuclear Operating Company for its units at Vogtle and supplements the DCD design information as to specific aspects of the standard plant design.  The NRC Staff has also completed the initial review of the Reference Plant COL application and issued a favorable comprehensive SER for the Reference Plant COL.  The ACRS has reviewed the NRC Staff's SER concerning the Reference Plant COL and issued a letter to the NRC informing it of the ACRS's conclusions and recommendations.
 
c)
                                     
Environmental Review
 
The NRC issued the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Units on April 15, 2010 to which SCE&G has responded.  The Final EIS (FEIS) is scheduled to be issued in April 2011.  This schedule continues to support the timely issuance of a COL for the Units.
 
d)
                                    
Legal Review
 
As noted previously, several parties sought to intervene to raise issues before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) in its review of SCE&G's COLA and their interventions were dismissed either because their contentions were deemed not to be admissible, or because they lacked standing.
On March 17, 2010, the ASLB considered the merits of the intervenors' contentions regarding Demand Side Management (DSM) programs and issued an order rejecting all contentions of the intervenors.  The intervenors have appealed the ASLB order on remand to the NRC.  On August 27, 2010, the NRC affirmed the ASLB order regarding the challenged DSM contentions.  The time for parties to appeal the NRC's decision has expired without any appeals being filed.  As a result, there are no contentions associated with the COLA.
e)
                                     
Schedule for Issuance of COLA
 
In light of its assessment of the current schedule for approval of the DCD amendments, SCE&G continues to believe that the COL for the Units will be issued in late 2011 or early 2012.  This schedule for the issuance of the COL would impact certain aspects of the construction schedule for the Units.  On December 13, 2010, SCE&G sent Westinghouse/Shaw a request for Change Order 11, initiating a study that will analyze potential impacts to the construction schedule due to the probable delay in receiving the COL.  Westinghouse/Shaw is in the process of conducting the study which will analyze the changes in the construction program that will be required either to keep the substantial completion date for Unit 2 as scheduled, or to delay substantial completion for Unit 2 by six months.  SCE&G is involved in on-going oversight of the study, and upon its completion, SCE&G will review the results to determine the path forward.  This continues to be a focus area.

Other Major Construction Permits
 
a)
                                    
SCDHEC Permits
 
i.
                                         
SCE&G submitted the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) Phase 5 Stormwater permit application which allows clearing and grading of 16.1 acres from the 13.8 kV alternate A/C line to the Raw Water Intake Structure (RWS).
 
ii.
                                      
SCE&G submitted the Preliminary Engineering Report and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit application to SCDHEC for the Wastewater System to Parr Reservoir. This application is for a permit to return fully treated discharge water into the Parr Reservoir.
 
b)
                                    
401 Water Quality Certification and 404 Wetlands Permit
 
i.
                                         
A 404 Wetlands Permit is required before undertaking construction within wetlands which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal government.  An accompanying 401 Water Quality Certification is required to assess whether aquatic life/water quality is adversely impacted by construction activities associated with a 404 Wetlands Permit.  The 404 Wetlands Permit for the Units encompasses the Units' cooling water intake and discharge structures, the cooling towers, and the permanent water treatment plant.   While not part of the 404 Wetlands Permit, the EIS on which the 404 is based covers the full extent of the plant, including the
 
transmission lines.  During the fourth quarter of 2010, SCE&G revised its 404 Wetlands Permit application for the project to reflect the Company's decision to use existing rights-of-way or to expand transmission corridors for the transmission lines to be constructed by SCE&G and Santee Cooper to serve the Units and has resubmitted that application to the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE).  Approval of this permit is expected in 2011.  SCDHEC and the ACOE are awaiting the NRC issuance of the FEIS before putting the 401/404 certification and application for the project on public notice.  Meanwhile, pending the issuance of the 401/404 permit for the project, Westinghouse/Shaw is working around the intermittent stream bank in the Cooling Towers area.  The timely issuance of the 401Water Quality Certification and the 404 Wetlands Permit is a focus area for the project.
c)
                                     
Other Permits
 
i.
                 
In October 2010, SCE&G submitted to the FERC a License Amendment Application to authorize it to withdraw cooling and other water for the Units from the Monticello Reservoir and to authorize other construction activities within the project boundaries of the reservoir.  Approval for this license amendment is anticipated to be granted in June of 2011.
 
ii.
              
SCE&G submitted to Norfolk Southern and its engineering consultant AECOM a permit application to bore under the existing rail line adjacent to Parr Reservoir for Units 2 & 3 Waste Water Discharge Blow Down Line.

BLRA Regulatory Proceedings
 
On August 9, 2010, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued its opinion in , 388 S.C. 486, 697 S.E.2d 587 (2010).  In the Opinion, the Court ruled that owner's capital cost contingencies were not permitted as a part of BLRA-approved capital cost forecasts under the BLRA until costs could be identified and itemized to specific cost items.  The Supreme Court's decision left open to SCE&G the option to petition the Commission under S.C. Code Ann. 58-33-270(E) to update the approved cash flow projections for the project.  The BLRA requires such updates to be allowed unless the changes in the cash flow projections are proven to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  On November 15, 2010, the Company filed with the Commission its Petition for Updates and Revisions to Capi tal Cost Schedules, Docket No. 2010-376-E.  As set forth on Exhibit 1 to the Petition, the Company has removed $438,291,000 in owner's capital cost contingencies from its cost projections.  In addition, the Petition shows that the Company has
South Carolina Energy Users Comm. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Comm'n
 
identified and itemized approximately $174 million in costs to specific cost items in the capital cost forecast.  Furthermore, the Petition updates the cash flow projections for the project to take into account all changes in the timing of cash flow requirements resulting from such things as changes in project construction schedules and shifts in milestone dates.  Under the BLRA, the Commission will have six months to consider this request.

Engineering Completion Status
 
a)
                                     
The Engineering Completion Status based on the completion percentage for major plant categories is as follows:
 
i.
                                         
Standard Plant Design  91.5% complete
 
ii.
                                      
Site Specific Design  75.3% complete
 
iii.
                                   
Total Design  85.3% complete
 
2.
                                     
Certified For Construction
 
a)
                                     
The Engineering Completion Status as reported above reflects the work necessary to bring the design outputs to a point where they are sufficient to support procurement, and construction planning.  At a later stage in the construction process, reporting will begin for Certified for Construction (CFC) design packages that will include all information necessary for construction of specific structures, systems or components.
 
b)
                                     
Westinghouse continues tracking the design finalization schedule for major engineering categories and flagging items that are currently below Westinghouse expectations, particularly items related to the site-specific need-based schedule for CFC design packages.  To date, gaps have been identified between the construction-need date and receipt of the applicable design package.  This issue is also being closely monitored by SCE&G.  However, the Westinghouse design finalization continues to support the respectiv e Substantial Completion dates of the Units.

Procurement/Fabrication Update
 
Shaw and Westinghouse had previously identified deficiencies in the quality assurance programs at Shaw Module Solutions (SMS) and Mangiarotti involving procedures and documentation.  Manufacturing holds were placed as a result of these deficiencies, and SCE&G is closely monitoring the actions being taken to correct the issues.
 
a)
                                     
As a result of the changes to the design of the Shield Building agreed to by Westinghouse with the NRC, all structural sub-modules continue to be on technical hold because of mechanical rebar coupler design review, leak chase design change, and material change.  Further deficiencies in SMS quality control  appear to have  affected the quality of the products being manufactured.  These deficiencies have resulted in Shaw placing a hold on all SMS work associated with the Units, with the exception of inspection s, while a Root Cause Investigation is conducted. SCE&G is actively involved in overseeing the response to these issues.  According to the revised module schedule, the on-hook dates of the CA20 and CA01 (., the dates by which fabrication is complete and they are ready to be lifted into place) have been delayed from December 2011 until March 2012 and June 2012, respectively.  Project schedule impacts continue to be assessed and the manufacturing and delivery of sub-modules remains a focus area.
i.e
 
b)
                                     
As previously reported, indications were discovered during testing of the Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) for the China AP1000 projects that warranted a root cause analysis by Westinghouse and its manufacturer, EMD.  A second diagnostic test of the RCP was completed in late 2010.  EMD then made improvements to the RCP in several areas. In the third diagnostic test, all parameters met expectations.  A more extensive Engineering Test of the RCP began on December 22, 2010 and was successfully completed subsequent to the reporting period.  There is no known adverse impact on the project schedule for the Units from this activity.
c)
                                     
Doosan continues with the fabrication of the Reactor Vessel for Unit 2.  The "Reactor Vessel Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Outlet Nozzle Welding to Flange Nozzle Shell Completion Unit 2" (10-3Q-3) is a BLRA milestone that was completed on December 30, 2010.  This
 
milestone completion supports the milestone date for the receipt of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel on site (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-6).
 
Doosan had previously reported that inspections had discovered a crack in the forging for the Unit 2 2B Steam Generator channel head; however, this issue was resolved in late 2010.  As a result, the next associated milestone, which is the milestone for Contractor Acceptance of the Steam Generator Equipment at the Port of Entry (BLRA milestone 13-2Q-2), currently is one month ahead of schedule.
 
d)
                                     
The Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Reactor Coolant Loop (RCL) Piping, hot leg manufacturing was delayed due to issues with some of the mockup pieces exceeding the maximum wall thickness.  However, bending of the Hot Leg (HL) 6 section, previously scheduled for the latter part of October, 2010, took place in December, 2010 with no issues.  Shipment of the Unit 2 RCL piping to the site (BLRA milestone 11-4Q-5) remains well ahead of schedule.
 
e)
                                     
As previously reported, Quality Assurance (QA) deficiencies were identified during a QA audit by Westinghouse of its supplier, Mangiarotti, leading to a number of temporary manufacturing holds being invoked by Westinghouse related to Mangiorotti's sub-suppliers.  Thereafter, Westinghouse has conducted multiple observations and reviews at the various fabrication facilities.  During the fourth quarter 2010, issues related to Mangiarotti's sub-suppliers regarding production and fabrication of AP1000 components for SCE&G were resolved.  As a result, two of the four BLRA milestones previously impacted by the hold have been completed as follows: 09-2Q-3 "Core Makeup Tank Fabricator Notice to Contractor Receipt of Long Lead Material  Units 2 & 3," (completed on 12/30/10); and 10-2Q-3 "Contractor Notified that Pressurizer Fabricator Performed Cladding on Bottom Head  Unit 2," (completed on 12/23/10).  Two remaining BLRA milestones that previously were impacted by the hold are as follows including the anticipated completion date for each: 11-3Q-3 "Pressurizer Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Welding of Upper and Intermediate Shells Completion  Unit 2," (target completion date of 3/31/11 with 5 month delay); and 12-1Q-2 "Passive Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger Fabricator Notice to Contractor of Final Post Weld Heat Treatment  Unit 2," (target completion date of 2/28/11 with 8 month delay). The projected completion dates for thes e milestones remain within the BLRA milestone schedule contingency. Also, the shipment of these components to the site remains on schedule. Mangiarotti has incorporated changes in its quality program to comply with industry and U.S. regulatory standards.  Continued oversight and surveillance are required to ensure
 
implementation of the revised process developed in response to remedial and corrective actions.
f)
                                       
The fabrication of the remaining major plant components is generally proceeding as planned.

Switchyard work progresses, with planned completion of construction currently on schedule for May 2012; at that time, the Switchyard will be prepared for testing.
 
2.
                                     
The Unit 2 power block excavation continues on schedule with rock blasting and removal ongoing within the Nuclear Island.  Detailed geologic mapping of the Unit 2 excavation resumed in January after blasting moved out of the area.  Unit 3 excavation began in January 2011, subsequent to this reporting period.
 
3.
                                     
The Circulating Water System (CWS) pipe installation backfill for Unit 3 was completed.
 
4.
                                     
MB Kahn has completed the expansion of the Nuclear Learning Center that will house the AP1000 reactor operator training simulators.
 
5.
                                     
The Module Assembly Building (MAB) structural work is substantially complete.  Steel stands ("platens"), utilized in the construction of Module CA20 are being installed.   The MAB currently is operating on temporary power, and installation of permanent electrical power for the inside of the building is scheduled for completion in February 2011.
 
6.
                                     
Foundation work and preparation for the Heavy Lift Derrick (HLD) continues on schedule, with rails to support the HLD and crane parts arriving on site.
 
7.
                                     
The first onsite batch plant continues to produce concrete for building pads, the HLD foundation, switchyard caissons, and electrical duct banks.   In late December 2010, the second batch plant arrived on-site, with assembly scheduled for the first quarter of 2011.
 
8.
                                     
Preparation for Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) mobilization continues, including installation of utilities that will support the work area and personnel trailers.  The three concrete pads on which the Containment Vessels will be constructed were completed.  Two cranes were assembled at the CB&I
 
fabrication pad area to support receipt of Containment Vessel Bottom Head (CVBH) material.  In early December 2010, CB&I received and stored all of the CVBH material on site.  Previous QA issues with CB&I regarding the storage of materials at the Vogtle plant have resulted in lessons-learned being incorporated into processes for this project to avoid similar issues.  Controls have been put in place, and all open issues with CB&I are being resolved and reviewed through the corrective action program.

Change Control/Owners Cost Forecast Update
 
1.
                                     
SCE&G has provided updated Owners Cost projections to the Commission in the Petition and those changes are explained in detail in the Company's direct pre-filed testimony in Docket No. 2010-376-E.  SCE&G will continue to review and update cost projections as planning for the project proceeds.
2.
                                     
The project capital cost forecasts attached to this report contain the following updates from those discussed in the Direct Pre-Filed Testimony of Carlette Walker in Docket No. 2010-376-E, dated January 26, 2011:
 
a)
                                     
Westinghouse/Shaw has reassigned a total of approximately $13 million in costs from the Non-Labor Costs Category to the Actual Craft Wages Cost Category.  This reassignment results in no change in the net cost of the project.
 
b)
                                     
As part of its on-going updating of the construction plan, Westinghouse/Shaw has made various timing changes in its cash flow schedules.  The timing changes are mutually off-setting and result in no change in the net cost of the project.
c)
                                     
SCE&G has moved unexpended amounts for Owners Costs and Transmission costs from 2010 to 2011.  This carry-forward of costs results in no change in the net cost of the project.
 
3.
                                     
EPC Contract Amendment No. 2 is scheduled to be issued to SCE&G for review, pending finalization of Change Order Numbers 8 and 11.  Change Order 8 is inclusive of EPC Contract components referenced in the Agreement signed by both Parties in August 2010 for the transfer of Target dollars to Fixed/Firm dollars, and is close to finalization.  Change Order 11 references the COL delay study, as outlined below.
 
4.
                                     
On December 13, 2010, SCE&G requested Change Order 11 to initiate a study that will analyze potential impacts to the construction schedule resulting from the probable delay in receiving the COL. Compiling the study will involve the preparation of alternative construction schedules and budgets for manpower and associated costs to accompany them.  The cost of this study will be shared 50/50 between Westinghouse/Shaw and SCE&G and Santee Cooper as joint owners of the project.  The parties have agreed to defer the discussion of payment responsibilities for any costs associated with the delay in issuing the COL until after the analysis initiated by Change Order 11 is completed and a path forward is chosen.  There is no increase in EPC Contract cost associated with this change order.
 
5.
                                     
Change Order 9 for the reconfiguration of five outgoing transmission lines from the Switchyard was approved in November 2010.  The scope of work necessary to facilitate this reconfiguration resulted in increased costs to SCE&G in the established Target Price and in the Firm Price components of the EPC Contract price.
6.
                                     
Change Order 10 was approved in December 2010. It provides for SCE&G to obtain real-time access to Westinghouse's Primavera Architecture ("P3
") software to support SCE&G's direct access to the integrated project schedule (IPS) through Westinghouse's server.  This access will allow real time collaboration and interface between SCE&G and Westinghouse.  The associated installation, license, and maintenance fees that are required to facilitate this process are being added to the EPC Contract price under the Fixed Price cost element.
 
7.
                                     
The change in cash flow forecast related to all change orders to date and changes in Owner's Costs including Transmission is projected to be $174 million in 2007 dollars, the largest component of which is the change in Owner's Cost.  The $174 million cost change is reflected in the cash flow projections contained in the exhibits to this Quarterly Report.

Transmission Update
 
1.
                                     
SCE&G's Power Delivery group has resolved the routes for the four 230kV transmission lines associated with the Units, ., theVCS1  Killian Line (Unit 2), the VCS2  Lake Murray Line (Unit 2), and the VCS2  St. George  #1 and #2 Lines (Unit 3).  These new lines will now occupy existing transmission right of way (ROW) corridors except for a segment of approximately 6 miles of the VCS1-Killian Line that will be built on a new ROW.
i.e
 
2.
                                     
The VCS-Winnsboro segment and the Winnsboro-Blythewood segment of the VCS1- Killian Line will be constructed on existing ROW.
 
3.
                                     
The Blythewood-Killian segment of the VCS1- Killian Line will be constructed on new ROW.  The siting of the Blythewood-Killian segment was determined by a siting process that included public workshops.  Public workshops were held on October 29, 2009 and March 16, 2010 to receive public comments on proposed siting and alternate routes for this line.  A final route was identified and route notification letters have been mailed to all property owners in the study area with survey notifications included for property owners adjacent to the selected route.  The transmission line centerline has been surveyed and ROW easement drawings have been prepared.  SCE&G currently plans to make first contact with property owners to obtain easements for the new ROW segment in early 2011.
 
4.
                                     
A final letter was mailed the first week in January 2011 to all property owners within the study area of the Winnsboro-Blythewood section of the VCS1- Killian Line announcing the close out of the siting study based upon the decision to use the existing ROW corridor.  The property owners were informed that no further public workshops are planned as a result of our decision.  The remaining section (VCS-Winnsboro) as noted above will also occupy existing ROW, and no formal workshops are planned.
5.
                                     
SCE&G has completed initial inventory surveys of its existing ROW corridors for the VCS2  Lake Murray Line and has conducted title searches of the existing properties.  Any question related to the scope or suitability of the existing easements and encroachments are being identified and assessed with resolution expected in the coming months.
 
6.
                                     
SCE&G has completed acquisition of additional land in St. George, South Carolina that will allow for installation of the breaker-and-a-half switchyard configuration needed to connect Unit 3 via two new VCS2  St. George Lines.  The decision to utilize existing corridors to the fullest extent possible to construct the VC Summer-St. George Lines is expected to eliminate or minimize the need to acquire new or expanded right-of-way for this line.
7.
                                     
SCE&G is negotiating an engineering, procurement and construction contract with Pike Electric Company, located in Mt Airy, NC to provide for the permitting, engineering and design, procurement of material, and the construction of the four lines needed to serve the Units.  SCE&G plans to execute this contract in early 2011.

Anticipated Construction Schedules
 
As of the end of 2010, the Company and its contractors remain on schedule to complete all required milestones as adjusted pursuant to the milestone schedule contingencies approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104(A).  Each of those adjustments is itemized in the Milestone Update section that follows.  Accordingly, the project is in compliance with the construction schedules approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12 and with the provisions of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-275(A)(1).
 
A.
                                   
Construction Schedule Update
 
The Project Licensing and Permitting, Engineering, Procurement and Construction work remains on schedule to meet the Units 2 & 3 Substantial Completion dates. Rescheduling of the milestones is addressed in Section III.B herein.  The rescheduling of these milestones is within the approved schedule contingencies and has no adverse impact on the Units' Substantial Completion dates.

Schedules of the Capital Costs Incurred Including Updates to the Information Required by S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B)(6) (the Inflation Indices)
 
The Capital Cost Update section of this report provides an update of the cumulative capital costs incurred and forecasted to be incurred in completing the project.  These costs are compared to the cumulative capital cost targets approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to remove the $438 million in contingency originally approved by the Commission, and to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates.  There has not been any use by
 
the Company of the capital cost timing contingencies that were approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104(A).  The Inflation Adjustments and Indices section of this report provides updated information on inflation indices and the changes in them.

As shown on , the actual expenditure for the project during the 12 months ended 2010 is $399 million.  As shown on , line 26, the cumulative amount spent on the project as of December 31, 2010 is $861 million.  The Cumulative Project Cash Flow target approved by the Commission for year-end 2010 adjusted for current escalation and excluding contingency and Westinghouse/Shaw billing differences is $890 million.  As a result, the cumulative cash flow at year-end 2010 is forecasted to be approximately $29 million less than the target.

Conclusion
 
As indicated above, the scheduled completion dates for Units 2 & 3 remain April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, respectively.  The Units are on track to be completed within the originally projected cost of $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars which included contingency funds.  The BLRA approved capital cost forecast, without contingencies, is $4.1 billion.  Present capital cost projections show that the Company will need to obtain Commission approval for additional expenditures above the $4.1 billion amount net of contingencies.  The Company maintains an extensive staff of experts that monitors and oversees the work of its contractors and has identified and continues to monitor closely all areas of concerns related to either cost or schedule for the project.  The Company will continue to update the Commission and ORS of progress and concerns as the project proce eds.
