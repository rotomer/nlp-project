On January 13, 2011, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Original Filing) to, among other things, report on Item 5.02 that on January 7, 2011 our Board of Directors elected Mr. Kevin B. Marsh as a member of the Board.  This Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Original Filing to provide information that was undetermined at the time of the Original Filing regarding Mr. Marshs appointment to the Executive Committee of the Board.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As a director who is also an officer, Mr. Marsh will not receive additional compensation for his service as a director, but he will continue to participate in the compensation arrangements described in the Executive Compensation section of the proxy statement for our 2010 annual meeting of shareholders. Mr. Marsh, 55, has been employed by us for almost 30 years in various capacities, including as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from 1998 to April 2006 and as SCE&Gs President and Chief Operating Officer from April 2006 to the present.  As such, Mr. Marsh brings substantial, hands-on experience to our Board.  His significant operational, financial and regulatory experience, as well as the leadership roles which he has played, are expected to be invaluable to the Board.
   
 
 On April 21, 2011, Mr. Marsh was assigned to the Executive Committee of the Board.
