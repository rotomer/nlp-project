 On April 26, 2011, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Original Filing) to report the results of votes taken by holders of our common stock at our annual meeting of shareholders held on April 21, 2011.  This Amendment No. 1 amends the Original Filing to disclose our decision, in light of the shareholder advisory vote on the matter, as to how frequently we will include a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers in our proxy materials until the next required shareholder advisory vote on such frequency is held.
   
 
 
Item 5.07                      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
Our annual meeting of shareholders was held on April 21, 2011. The following matters were voted upon at the meeting by the holders of our common stock.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although the terms of the elected directors expire in 2014, Mr. Amick will reach age 70 in May of 2013. The registrants articles of incorporation mandate that the term of any director who is not a salaried employee expires at the annual meeting next preceding the date such director attains age 70. Accordingly, Mr. Amicks term will expire at the 2013 Annual Meeting.

Mr. Timmerman will retire as director effective November 30, 2011.

On August 11, 2011, our Board of Directors determined, consistent with the shareholders' advisory vote on the matter, to include a shareholder advisory vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers in the proxy materials for our annual meeting of shareholders every three years until the next required shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of such advisory votes is held.
