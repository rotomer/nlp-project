Introduction and Summary
 
A.
                                   
Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G or the Company) to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the Commission) and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS).  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2010) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104(A).  This report provides updated information concerning the status of the construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station Units 2 & 3 (the Units) and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units.  The Commission approved updated construction schedules for the Units in Order No. 2010-12.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules for the Units in Order No. 2011-345 issued in May of 2011.
 
Order No. 2011-345 was based on updated cost schedules that SCE&G filed with the Commission on November 15, 2010, and supplemented on March 8, 2011.  Those updated schedules removed $438,291,000 in owner's capital cost contingencies in response to the South Carolina Supreme Court opinion in , 388 S.C. 486, 697 S.E.2d 587 (2010) (the Opinion).  The updated schedules also included approximately $174 million in capital costs that the Company had identified and itemized to specific cost items for the project since Order No. 2009-104(A).  They further reflected all changes in the timing of cash flow requirements since Order No. 2010-12 was adopted.

Structure of Report and Appendices
 
The current reporting period is the quarter ending June 30, 2011.  The report is divided into the following sections:
 
 
Appendices 1, 2, and 4
to this report contain detailed financial, milestone and other information updating the schedules approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12.  For reference purposes, provides a copy of the approved capital cost schedule for the project without adjustments in the form approved in Order No. 2011-345.
Appendix 3
 
A confidential and a public version of this report and its attachments are being provided.  All cost information presented reflects only SCE&G's share of the project's cost.  Attached to the end of the report is a glossary of acronyms and defined terms used in it.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current construction milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104(A).  There are 146 separate milestones.  Of these, 61 have been completed as of June 30, 2011.  Comparing the scheduled milestone completion dates as of the date of this report to the milestone completion dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 73 milestones have changed.  Of these, 30 have been accelerated and 43 have been delayed for between one and 12 months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
As this report indicates, the Company is on track to complete the Units at the capital cost forecast of approximately $4.3 billion as approved in Order No. 2011-345.
In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission recognized that forecasts of AFUDC expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  New escalation indices were issued in May 2011 for the period of July-December of 2010 and those indices have been used in forecasting the construction costs for the project presented here.  below compares the current capital cost forecast to the forecast presented in the last quarterly report.
Chart A
 
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including current escalation, to the forecast on which the Commission relied in adopting Order No. 2011-345.  Chart B shows that the forecasted capital cost of the Units in 2007 dollars has decreased by approximately $103,000.  This reduction reflects the voluntary decision by the Company, communicated to the Commission by letter dated April 25, 2011, that it would not seek recovery for $103,000 in Community/Support Outreach costs that Westinghouse/Shaw had included in costs to be charged under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement (EPC Contract) for the Units. Due to the changes in forecasted escalation when netted against changes in AFUDC as discussed more fully below the cost of the plant in future dollars has decreased by $166 million.
E.
                                     
Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104(A), the most current twelve-month inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  As stated above, new escalation indices were last issued in May 2011 for the period of July-December of 2010 and those rates are reflected in this report.
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have begun to drop.  The current one-year averages and five-year averages are now closer to historical ten-year rates than they have been in certain past periods.  Current escalation rates are shown on , below.

AFUDC
 
The AFUDC for the project is currently projected to be approximately $6 million lower than the forecast on which Order No. 2011-345 was based.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104(A), SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's AFUDC rate is currently 5.87% which is the same rate that applied when Order No. 2011-345 was issued.  Standing alone, the current AFUDC rate would produce no change in the forecasted amount of AFUDC.  However, lower escalation rates, as partially off-set by the effect of timing changes in the cash flows, have reduced the forecasted project cash flows for the project thereby reducing forecasted AFUDC.

Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
The current approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target for the project was adopted by the Commission in Order No. 2011-345.  In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data.
 
Appendix 2, Chart A
provides the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up to December 31, 2010, have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates up to that date.  The cash flow targets for the first quarter of 2011 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices, which, for purposes of this report, are the indices provided in May of 2011 that are current through December 31, 2010.  When actual indices for the period January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2011, become available, the cash flow data for the first and second quarters of 2011 will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2, Chart A
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the figures presented on for 2011 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order No. 2009-104(A).  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, Westinghouse/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments in the following period to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to to offset the timing differences that arise as a result of Westinghouse/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits which applies to those EPC cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.  The adjustment for calendar year 2011 is calculated to be approximately ($1.0) million based on data for the second quarter of 2011.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Construction of the Units is progressing on schedule.  As indicated in prior reports, for some time the schedule for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) review of the Combined Operating License (COL) application has supported issuance of the COL in late 2011 or early 2012.  Issuance of a COL during this period would not allow Unit 2 to be completed by the substantial completion date set forth in the EPC Contract without changes to the construction schedule.  In response, in February of 2011 SCE&G approved Change Order 11 to the EPC Contract to provide for Westinghouse/Shaw to perform a COL Delay Impact Study to assess strategies for
dealing with the delay.  In response, in February of 2011 SCE&G approved Change Order 11 to the EPC Contract to provide for Westinghouse/Shaw to perform a COL Delay Impact Study to assess strategies for dealing with the delay.  The study initially presented two alternative approaches.  One scenario compressed the construction schedule for Unit 2 to retain the current substantial completion date.  The second scenario pushed the substantial completion date for Unit 2 out by six months.  In March 2011, Westinghouse/Shaw submitted a preliminary draft of the study for review and critique by SCE&G.  Upon review of the draft, SCE&G requested that the study evaluate a third scenario.  That third scenario considers accelerating the substantial completion date for Unit 3 to determine whether such acceleration, when coupled with a delay in the Unit 2 substantial completion date, would create economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule.  The logic of this third scenario is discussed more fully below at section II.E.4.  A subsequent draft of the COL Delay Study Report has been provided to SCE&G for review and evaluation. SCE&G senior executives have initiated discussions with Westinghouse/Shaw senior management on the draft study.
 
Westinghouse/Shaw remains under a contractual commitment to complete the Units by the substantial completion dates of April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019.  Pending a final decision on the path forward related to the schedule changes being considered at this time, SCE&G has not authorized Westinghouse/Shaw to change the substantial completion dates listed in the project schedules for either of the Units.  However, some milestones that are internal to the project have shifted in ways that would otherwise require a shift in the substantial completion date.  At such time as a path forward to respond to the delays in the COL issuance and related matters is determined, the substantial completion dates for all milestones will be reset to reflect the resulting construction schedule.
 
As discussed in more detail below, SCE&G does not have any information indicating that the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan will impact the construction schedules for the Units.
 
A more detailed presentation of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.

The Combined Operating License Application (COLA)
 
a)
                                     
Design Control Document (DCD) Revisions
 
In December 2010, the NRC Staff issued a favorable Safety Evaluation Report (SER) on Design Control Document (DCD) Revision 18.  During that same month, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) reviewed the SER and determined that the AP1000 design is fully adequate to protect public health and safety.  In response, Westinghouse (WEC) prepared a conforming Revision 19 to the DCD amendment application to incorporate into the DCD information that WEC previously had provided the NRC through Requests for Additional Information (RAIs).  DCD Revision 19 also includes additional conforming amendments to the design that WEC has agreed to make as a result of the NRC's safety evaluation.  WEC provided the NRC with DCD Revision 19 on June 13, 2011.  The Final Safety Evaluation Report (FSER) concerning the DCD amendments was issued on August 5, 2011, subsequent to this reporting period.  Commission action on the rulemaking for those amendments is expected in October 2011.  The NRC schedule for DCD approval continues to support issuance of a COL for the Units in late 2011 or early 2012.
 
b)
                                     
Site-Specific COL and Reference Plant COL
 
As of January 2011, the NRC Staff completed both its Phase A and B reviews to support development of the Advanced Final Safety Evaluation Report (AFSER) for the site-specific COLA for the Units.  The second ACRS subcommittee meeting to review the remaining site specific information was held January 10 and 11, 2011.  No significant issues were identified.  In early February, the third and final full Committee ACRS meeting concluded favorably.  As a result, on February 17, 2011, the ACRS issued a letter to the NRC supporting approval of the final COLA approval process to be conducted by the NRC Commissioners.  On March 26, 2011, the NRC Staff completed Phase C of the safety review.  On August 2, 2011, subsequent to this reporting period, SCE&G received a letter from the NRC Staff concluding that the application for a site-specific COL for the Units is complete and providing a schedule for future action that supports issuance of a final COL in the late 2011 or early 2012 time period.
 
The NRC's review of the Reference Plant COL submitted by Southern Nuclear Operating Company for its units at Vogtle is on a similar schedule as the Units.
c)
                                     
Environmental Review
 
In April 2011, the NRC completed the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Units.  This is a significant milestone for the project, and completes the review of environmental impacts of the project.  The approval of the FEIS in April 2011 supports the issuance of a COL for the Units in late 2011 or early 2012.
 
d)
                                     
Legal Review
 
As noted in previous filings, several parties sought to intervene to raise issues before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) in its review of SCE&G's COLA.  These interventions were dismissed either because their contentions were deemed not to be admissible, or because the intervenors lacked standing.  As a result, there are no active contentions associated with the COLA.
 
On April 18, 2011, a number of individuals and environmental groups filed a petition before the NRC to suspend all pending reactor licensing decisions and related rulemaking decisions based on the events associated with the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  Subsequent to this reporting period on August 10, 2011, Friends of the Earth and the South Carolina Chapter of the Sierra Club filed supplemental comments with the NRC in support of the April 18, 2011 petition.  The NRC has taken no action with regard to this petition.  The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
 
On March 21, 2011, the NRC established a senior level agency task force to conduct a comprehensive review of the NRC processes and regulations in light of the events in Japan.  The task force issued a preliminary report at the 90 day interval which is under review.  The task force will complete a longer-term review and issue another report no later than six months from the beginning of the evaluation.  On May 12, 2011, the task force conducted its initial briefing with the NRC and did not express any concerns regarding the Units.
 
SCE&G has no reason to believe that any of these matters will impact the schedule for issuance of the COL for the Units.

SCDHEC Permits
 
i.
     
To address comments made by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control ("SCDHEC"), SCE&G re-submitted the Preliminary Engineering Report and National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit application for the Wastewater System to Parr Reservoir.  This application is for a permit to return fully treated discharge water into the Parr Reservoir.  The administrative review of this submittal is now complete and the technical review by SCDHEC is in process.
 
b)
                                     
404 Wetlands Permit and 401 Water Quality Certification
 
i.
      
A 404 Wetlands Permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) is required before undertaking construction within wetlands which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal government.  An accompanying 401 Water Quality Certification is required to assess whether aquatic life/water quality is adversely impacted by construction activities associated with a 404 Wetlands Permit.  The 404 Wetlands Permit for the Units encompasses the Units' cooling water intake and discharge structures, the cooling towers, and the permanent water treatment plant.  The EIS on which the 404 Wetlands Permit will be based is the EIS that was prepared for the NRC as part of the COLA review for the Units and covers the full extent of the project, including the off-site transmission lines.  During the fourth quarter of 2010, SCE&G revised its 404 Wetlands Permit application for the project to reflect the Company's decision to use existing rights-of-way or to expand transmission corridors for the transmission lines to be constructed by SCE&G and Santee Cooper to serve the Units and has resubmitted that application to the ACOE.  In April 2011, the NRC issued the FEIS for the Units and SCE&G is now awaiting the 404 Wetlands Permit and 401 Water Quality Certification.  The ACOE placed the 404 Wetlands Permit on public notice in June 2011.  Issuance of this permit is expected in the Fall of 2011.  There is one intermittent stream bank in the Cooling Towers area which cannot be disturbed until the 404 Wetlands Permit is issued.  Shaw will work around this stream bank area until that time.

Other Permits
i.
      
In late 2010, SCE&G submitted to the FERC a License Amendment Application to authorize it to withdraw cooling and other water for the Units from the Monticello Reservoir
and to authorize other construction activities within the project boundaries of the reservoir.  Approval for this license amendment is anticipated to be granted in the Fall of 2011.

BLRA Regulatory Proceedings
 
In May 2011, the Commission issued Order No. 2011-345 approving the updated capital cost schedules for the project.  Parties objecting to the order had ten days from receipt of the order to file a petition for rehearing with the Commission.  No petitions were filed and the Order of the Commission is final.

Engineering Completion Status
 
The V.C. Summer Units 2 & 3 Total Plant Design Completion Status is as follows:
 
i.
                            
Site Specific Design  80.7% complete
ii.
                        
Standard Plant VCS Construction Ready Drawings   12.9% complete
 
Standard Plant Design is essentially 100% complete and no longer tracked for reporting purposes.  Construction Ready Drawings are now being tracked in lieu of Certified for Construction (CFC) drawings and include the information necessary for construction of specific structures, systems or components.

Site Specific Design Activities
 
Shaw Engineering continues to perform Site Specific Design work to support Site Specific Systems, to include the Circulating Water System, Yard Fire System, Potable Water System, Raw Water System, Sanitary Drain System and Waste Water System, and the Switchyard.  There is a delay in Switchyard design progress, which is being tracked by SCE&G Engineering and Construction.  This delay is not expected to impact the substantial completion dates.
 
3.
                                     
Procurement/Fabrication Update
 
a)
                                     
During the last quarter of 2010, Shaw placed on hold all fabrication or rework activities related to the Units by Shaw Modular Solutions (SMS).  The purpose of the hold was to evaluate and correct quality assurance (QA) issues at SMS's fabrication facility.  A root cause
investigation was conducted.  On January 10, 2011, the NRC was unable to complete a vendor inspection audit at SMS due to the lack of actual production work ongoing.  The NRC then requested a plan of action from SMS addressing all issues identified since initiation of fabrication.  SMS responded to the NRC's request, outlining corrective actions put in place to elevate SMS's QA program implementation to the level of effectiveness required for fabrication of AP1000 modules.  In addition, the Consortium has increased its QA/QC oversight and presence at the SMS facility, and SMS has undertaken a broad-based program for improving its quality control practices and procedures and strengthening the nuclear safety culture at its facility.
 
On March 7, 2011, the Shaw Nuclear Quality Assurance annual implementation audit was performed.  At this time, SMS received approval to begin rework activities of floor submodules.  Phase I Prototype activities are on-going, and welding activities have begun for Module Prototype Phase II.  Westinghouse/Shaw has provided SCE&G with an updated module fabrication and delivery schedule that takes into account recent delays and the schedule impacts that can be anticipated from SMS's on-going implementation of its new processes and QA culture.  The review of this schedule remains a focus area.  The on-hook date of the CA20 (., the date by which fabrication is complete and the module is ready to be lifted into place) has been revised to August 2012 based on the most recent preliminary fabrication schedule which was provided by Shaw in July 2011 subsequent to this reporting period.

b)
                                     
As previously reported, WEC identified QA deficiencies during an audit of its supplier, Mangiarotti, leading to WEC invoking a number of temporary manufacturing holds related to Mangiarotti's sub-suppliers.  WEC conducted multiple observations and reviews at the various fabrication facilities in an effort to resolve the sub-supplier issues regarding production and fabrication of AP1000 components for SCE&G.  As a result of these efforts, two of the four BLRA milestones previously impacted by the hold were completed during the fourth quarter of 2010.  However, past Stop Work Orders and failed sub-supplier qualifications have impacted fabrication activities and the delivery schedule.  There is a potential negative impact to the site delivery dates regarding Accumulator Tanks, the Passive Residual Heat Removal Heat Exchanger (PRHR) and Core Make-up Tanks (CMT); however, WEC is working with Mangiarotti to improve the schedule.  Mangiarotti has increased human resources assigned to fabrication and has begun working weekends to ensure required on-site delivery dates are recovered and maintained.  The production schedule of all Mangiarotti equipment is being closely monitored by
SCE&G and the Consortium to ensure that equipment delivery supports the schedule, and any related BLRA milestones remain within the specified contingency.
 
c)
                                     
Additional tests were required on the Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) for the China AP1000 projects due to indications discovered during initial testing that warranted a root cause analysis by Westinghouse and the manufacturer, EMD.  Improvements to the RCP were made in several areas.  A more extensive Engineering Test of the RCP began on December 22, 2010, and was successfully completed in January 2011.  The Endurance Test began on April 28, 2011 but was suspended to investigate temperature data in a localized area within the stator core.  No delay in the site delivery of the RCPs is anticipated.
 
d)
                                     
Doosan continues with the fabrication of the Reactor Vessels and Steam Generators for Units 2 and 3 and is working to gain additional positive float in the manufacturing schedule to ensure production meets the applicable BLRA milestones.
 
e)
                                     
As previously reported, the Unit 2 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Reactor Coolant Loop (RCL) Piping being manufactured by Tioga experienced delays in hot leg manufacturing due to issues with some of the mockup pieces exceeding the maximum wall thickness.  Although bending of the Hot Leg (HL) 6 section took place in December 2010 with no issues, RCS loop piping continues to be on hold, pending resolution of grain size deviations.  SCE&G and the Consortium are closely monitoring any potential impacts to BLRA milestone 11-4Q-5 regarding shipment of the Unit 2 RCL piping to the site.
 
f)
                                       
As previously reported, a Stop Work Order had been put in effect for SPX, which manufactures Squib Valves for the Units.  The Stop Work Order has now been lifted. WEC is reviewing an SPX recovery plan and fabrication schedule and assessing schedule impacts.  This is a focus area.
 
g)
                                    
Equipment being manufactured in Japan continues to be closely monitored to determine any future schedule impacts related to the recent earthquake.  This equipment includes the Turbine Generator, Main Transformer, and Containment Vessel.  Immediately following the March
2011 earthquake, the Consortium issued a Force Majeure letter informing SCE&G of possible effects to the manufacturing schedule.  At this time, however, no schedule impacts have been identified.  None of the suppliers or sub-supplier facilities for the project are located in the immediate area of the earthquake.  In addition, no suppliers or sub-suppliers have reported damage to equipment or work in progress.  As a result, the principal area of concern is the effect of limited supplies of electricity and diversion of engineering resources to the recovery effort.  To date, no specific delays have been reported.

Construction Update
 
1.
                                     
Preconstruction work in the Switchyard continues.  However, due to weather delays, late issuance of documents for review, and delayed resolution of issues associated with design compliance to the approved Switchyard specifications, work continues to be behind schedule. Shaw has made organizational changes and is making efforts to address the schedule concerns. There is no known impact to substantial completion dates from these schedule issues related to preconstruction work.  Pike Energy Solutions (Pike), the Switchyard contractor to Shaw, has been given a Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) by SCE&G to begin its portion of the work.

The Module Assembly Building (MAB) is complete.  The assembly of the CA20 Platen is expected to be completed in August.  The first floor sub-module from SMS was received on site in June 2011.  Shortly thereafter, SCE&G's inspectors identified quality control issues related to the storage of the submodules by Shaw, which Shaw promptly corrected.
 
5.
                                     
Assembly of the Heavy Lift Derrick (HLD) carriage continues with parts arriving on site.  Issues with the HLD foot castings have been identified at the HLD manufacturing facility and are being evaluated for technical resolution and schedule impact.  As a result, the load testing of the HLD has been moved from 3
rd
 quarter 2011 to 1
st
 quarter 2012.  In order to mitigate the schedule impact,
Shaw is evaluating the lift plans to see if smaller cranes could handle the first series of lifts to be made after receipt of the COL.  This is a focus area.
 
6.
                                     
Work on the design and testing of the safety-related concrete mix is ongoing.  Some activities in the concrete testing schedule have experienced delays.  Efforts are ongoing to accelerate the testing and quality approvals to avoid delays in the placement of the first safety-related concrete in the Unit 2 nuclear island.  This is a focus area.

The Limited Scope Simulator (LSS) remains on schedule to be operational in the first quarter of 2012;however, WEC recently informed SCE&G of a change in the schedule to conduct Integrated Systems Validation (ISV) testing on the LSS at WEC.  The change is due to incomplete design inputs, procedures, and Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) that are to be incorporated in the LSS.  This change could affect the capability of the LSS delivered to the site.  Discussions between SCE&G and WEC continue in an effort to resolve this issue.  This is a focus area.

Change Order 8 has been approved by SCE&G and Westinghouse/Shaw.  Change Order 8 embodies the provisions referenced in the Agreement signed by both Parties in August 2010 for the transfer of 11 scopes of work totaling approximately $315 million from Target to Fixed/Firm cost categories.
 
4.
                                     
In February 2011, SCE&G approved Change Order 11, which initiated a study conducted by Westinghouse/Shaw that analyzed potential impacts to the construction schedule due to the current schedule for receiving the COL.  The original study considered two scenarios.  One involved compressing the construction schedule to maintain the April 1, 2016 substantial completion date for Unit 2.  The other involved delaying that date by 6 months.  SCE&G subsequently requested that the study consider a third scenario, under which the substantial completion date of Unit 2 would be delayed by 6 months and the substantial completion date of Unit 3 would be accelerated.  By narrowing the gap between the Units, it may be possible to create construction efficiencies by avoiding the demobilization and remobilization of crews as work progresses from one unit to the next.  A draft report including the third scenario has been provided to SCE&G for validation and review. The senior executives of the respective companies have initiated discussions of this draft study report.
