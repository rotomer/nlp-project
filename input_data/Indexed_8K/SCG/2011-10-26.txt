Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For
Immediate Release
 
Cayce, S.C., Oct. 26, 2011...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced basic earnings for the third quarter of 2011 of $105 million, or 81 cents per share, compared to $101 million, or 80 cents per share, for the third quarter of 2010. The increase in earnings for the third quarter of 2011 was primarily attributable to improved margin from electric base rate increases which were partially offset by higher interest expense and share dilution.
 
"We are pleased that our basic earnings per share for the third quarter of 2011 were higher than last year and in line with our expectations," said Jimmy Addison, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "In a challenging economy we continue to demonstrate growth in our customer base and discipline in our cost control."
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, SCANA reported basic earnings of $289 million, or $2.25 per share, compared to $281 million, or $2.25 per share, for the same period in 2010.  Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower gas margins, increases in interest, depreciation, and property tax expenses, and share dilution.
 
"We are pleased with the level of industrial announcements throughout our service territory this year," said Addison. "During 2011, we have seen numerous companies announce plans to locate or expand their businesses in South Carolina.  These announcements translate into a projected investment of more than $2 billion, with the potential for over 5,500 new jobs in the areas we serve.  This represents the best year for industrial announcements since before the recession."
 
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
 
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
 
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, reported earnings in the third quarter of 2011 of $120 million, or 92 cents per share, compared to $111 million, or 87 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases were partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expense and share dilution.  At September 30, 2011, SCE&G was serving approximately 665,000 electric customers and
 
 
approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8 and 1.3 percent, respectively, over the same date in 2010.
 
PSNC Energy
 
PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported a seasonal loss of $5 million, or 3 cents per share, in the current quarter, compared to a loss of $5 million, or 4 cents per share in 2010.  Increased margin from customer growth was offset by higher property taxes.  At September 30, 2011, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 476,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.7 percent over the previous year.
 
SCANA Energy - Georgia
 
SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $4 million, or 3 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2011, compared to a loss of $3 million, or 2 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.  The difference is driven primarily by lower margins which were partially offset by decreased operating expenses.  At September 30, 2011, SCANA Energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers, maintaining its position as the state's second largest natural gas marketer.
 
Corporate and Other, Net
 
SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported a loss in the third quarter of 2011 of $6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared to a loss of $2 million or 1 cent per share in 2010.  The results for 2011 reflect higher income taxes at the holding company from levelizing the effective tax rate due to the cyclical nature of our business as required by accounting standards.
 
EARNINGS OUTLOOK
 
The Company affirms its previous guidance that 2011 earnings will be in the range of $2.95 to $3.10, with an internal target of $3.02 per share.  For 2012, the Company's preliminary estimate is that earnings will be in the range of $3.05 to $3.25, with an internal target of $3.17 per share.
 
These estimates assume the extension of the 2010 equity forward to late 2012 and exclude any potential impacts from changes in accounting principles and gains or losses from certain investing activities, litigation, and sales of assets.  Other factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement.
