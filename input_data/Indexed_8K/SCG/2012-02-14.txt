Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G or the Company) to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the Commission) and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS).  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2011) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104(A).  This report provides updated information concerning the status of the construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station Units 2 & 3 (the Units) and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units.  The Commission approved updated construction schedules for the Units in Order No. 2010-12.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules for the Units in Order No. 2011-345 issued on May 16, 2011.

Structure of Report and Appendices
 
The current reporting period is the quarter ending December 31, 2011.  The report is divided into the following sections:
 
Appendices 1, 2, and 4
to this report contain detailed financial, milestone and other information updating the schedules approved by the Commission in Order Nos. 2010-12 and 2011-345.  For reference purposes, provides a copy of the approved capital cost schedule for the project in the form approved in Order No. 2011-345.
Appendix 3
 
A confidential and a public version of this report and its attachments are being provided.  All cost information presented reflects only SCE&G's share of the project's cost in 2007 dollars unless otherwise specified.  Attached to the end of the report is a glossary of acronyms and defined terms used in it.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the
report
indicates, the Company has met all current construction milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104(A).  There are 146 separate milestones.  Of these, 68 have been completed as of December 31, 2011.  Comparing the scheduled milestone completion dates as of the date of this report to the milestone completion dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 69 milestones have changed.  Of these, 27 have been accelerated and 42 have been delayed for between one and 13 months.
 
D.
                                   
Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
Spending through December 31, 2011 in current dollars is approximately $148,937,000 below the capital cost schedule approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The present cash flow forecast indicates that the Company will be able to complete the Units for $4,288,638,000 in 2007 dollars, which is $18,234,000 above the forecast approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The current cost estimates include a) increased costs being passed on to SCE&G by its contractors Westinghouse (WEC)/Shaw as a result of new federal health care laws, b) increased costs for cyber security measures for the Units, c) incremental cost associated with the revision to the design of the water discharge system and d) new forecasts of Transmission cost.  The specific items resulting in these increases are discussed in more detail in Section II.
 
Not included in these cost forecasts are costs related to claims being made by WEC/Shaw for additional cost recovery which SCE&G is challenging (Challenged Costs), and updated Owners cost forecasts, which are in the process of being finalized.  As discussed in Section II, the amount of the increase in Owners costs is estimated to be approximately $150 million and will be presented to the Commission for review and approval in a future filing under S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E) (Update Filing).  The upper bound on the amount of Challenged Costs being claimed by WEC/Shaw is
approximately $188 million in 2007 dollars.  SCE&G has not accepted the validity of this claim and is hopeful that this will be resolved through negotiations.
 
In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission recognized that forecasts of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  The current escalation indices were issued in November of 2011 for the period of January-June of 2011 and current indices have been used in forecasting the construction costs for the project that are presented here.  below compares the current capital cost forecast to the forecast presented in the last quarterly report.
Chart A
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including current escalation, to the forecast on which the Commission relied in adopting Order No. 2011-345.  Chart B shows that the forecasted capital cost of the Units in 2007 dollars has increased by approximately $18,234,000.  This increase reflects the additions to the budget referenced in Section I. D above and is explained in more detail in Section II of this report.  It is offset by the voluntary decision by the Company, communicated to the Commission by letter dated April 25, 2011, that it would not seek recovery for $103,000 in Community Support/Outreach costs that WEC/Shaw had included in costs to be
charged under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement (EPC Contract) for the Units. Due to the changes in forecasted escalation, when netted against changes in AFUDC, see Section I. F, below, the cost of the plant in future dollars has decreased by $181 million since Order No. 2011-345 was issued.
 
E.
                                     
Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104(A), the most current one year inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  The most current escalation indices are found in the Handy-Whitman July 2011 update which was issued in November 2011 and reports data for the period January-June of 2011. Those rates are reflected in this report.
 
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have dropped.  The current one-year averages and five-year averages are now closer to historical ten-year rates than they have been in certain past periods.  Current escalation rates are shown on , below. When compared to the previous quarter, the current update shows an upward trend in rates.

AFUDC
 
The AFUDC for the project is currently projected to be approximately $43 million lower than the forecast on which Order No. 2011-345 was based.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104(A), SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's projected AFUDC rate is currently 4.88% versus a rate of 5.87% that applied when Order No. 2011-345 was issued.
 
G.
                                   
Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
The current approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target for the project was adopted by the Commission in Order No. 2011-345.  In Order No. 2009-104(A), the
Commission provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data.
 
Appendix 2
provides the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up until June 30, 2011, have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates.  The cash flow targets for the third quarter of 2011 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices, which for purposes of this report, are the indices provided in November of 2011 that report data through June 30, 2011.  When actual indices for the period July 1, 2011, to December 31, 2011, become available, the cash flow data for the third and fourth quarters of 2011 will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the figures presented on for 2011 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order No. 2009-104(A).  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, WEC/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to to offset the timing differences that arise as a result of WEC/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits.  This adjustment applies to those EPC contract cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.

II.            Progress of Construction of the Units
 
The substantive reviews and key procedural steps have been completed for issuance by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of the Combined Operating License (COL) for the Units.  Action by the Commission is expected in early 2012.  Issuance of the COL will represent the successful completion of a major milestone in the construction project.  The substantive reviews and key procedural steps required for issuance of the 404 Wetlands permit for the project are also complete and issuance of that permit is also expected in early 2012.
 
Construction work on site is proceeding safely and efficiently.  The project has completed the work necessary to allow the first nuclear safety-related construction to commence on site when the COL is issued.  This was an important goal for the project.  Nuclear safety-related work can only begin after the COL is issued and SCE&G authorizes WEC/Shaw to proceed.
In addition, the project has compiled a safety record that is unprecedented for a heavy construction site of its size, totaling approximately 5 million safe-work hours, with few recordable injuries (all minor) and only two lost time incidences since construction began over three years ago.
 
Fabrication of forgings and other equipment continues to proceed well and is on a schedule that supports the on-site construction schedule.  A significant area for focus related to the project involves module fabrication work at Shaw Modular Solutions (SMS). This work has been delayed due to module redesign, production issues, manpower issues and Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) issues.  SMS reports that these issues have been resolved, but SCE&G continues to monitor this area carefully and considers it to be a focus area for the project.
 
As previously reported, WEC/Shaw has conducted a COL Delay Impact study as authorized in Change Order No. 11.  As indicated in prior reports, the current construction schedule was based on the anticipated issuance of a COL in mid-2011.  Issuance of the COL in early 2012 will not allow Unit 2 to be completed by the previously established substantial completion date without changes to the construction schedule.  In response, WEC/Shaw performed a COL Delay Impact Study to assess strategies for mitigating the delay.  A total of three alternative approaches are presented in the study.  One scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2 to retain the current substantial completion date, and does not change the substantial completion date of Unit 3.  The second scenario pushes the substantial completion date for Unit 2 out to accommodate the COL delay and again does not change the substantial completion date of Unit 3.  The third scenario (Scenario 3) considers delaying the substantial completion date for Unit 2 and accelerating the substantial completion date for Unit 3 to create economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule.  Better synchronizing the construction schedules between the two units can allow crews to move seamlessly from one unit to the next, thereby avoiding demobilization and remobilization cost.  SCE&G has informed WEC/Shaw that it intends to pursue Scenario 3 and accelerate the substantial completion date for Unit 3.  SCE&G has also begun discussions with WEC/Shaw concerning the need to prepare updated cash flow forecasts and schedules on that basis.  Those updated forecasts and cash flow schedules will be presented to the Commission in a future Update Filing.
 
WEC/Shaw has asserted the right to additional cost recovery under the EPC Contract for certain Challenged Costs, which include claims by WEC/Shaw for additional cost recovery associated with delays in NRC licensing, unanticipated rock conditions where the foundation for the Unit 2 Nuclear Island (NI) will be constructed, design modifications to the shield building, and design modifications to certain prefabricated structural modules that will be used in building the Units, (including resulting increases in construction costs for both redesigns).  While the parties have not reached agreement,
SCE&G's portion of the claims as presented by WEC/Shaw is approximately $188 million in 2007 dollars.  This figure represents the upper bound of known claims for the items identified.  SCE&G has not accepted the validity of these claims and is hopeful that they will be resolved through negotiations.
 
At present all milestone completion dates are within approved schedule contingencies.
 
A more detailed presentation of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.
 
A.            Licensing and Permitting
 
1.
                                     
Design Control Document (DCD) Revisions
 
In December 2011, the NRC voted unanimously in support of approval of Revision 19 to the Design Control Document for the AP1000 reactor.  On December 30, 2011, following the affirmative vote on Revision 19, the rulemaking for the AP1000 reactor design was published in the Federal Register.  The NRC waived the customary 30-day waiting period for the rule to become effective immediately after publication.
 
2.
                                     
The Combined Operating License Application (COLA)
 
In October 2011, the NRC held its Mandatory Hearing on the V.C. Summer Units 2 & 3 site-specific COLA.  On February 9, 2012, the NRC voted to grant a COL for the AP1000 Reference Plant, which is Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being constructed by Southern Company.  The NRC is now in a position to vote on issuing the site specific COL to SCE&G which is expected to happen in the next several weeks.  The issuance of the COL for the Units will provide SCE&G with the authority required under the statutes administered by the NRC to construct and operate the Units and will allow nuclear safety-related construction work to begin.
 
3.
                                     
NRC Response to the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami of March 2011
 
As previously reported, the NRC established a senior level agency task force to conduct a review of the NRC processes and regulations currently in place in light of the lessons learned from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the subsequent core-damaging accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.  The task force issued a report in July 2011 that set forth twelve (12) comprehensive safety recommendations for a balanced approach to accident mitigation during low-likelihood, high consequence events such as prolonged
station power outages resulting from naturally occurring phenomena.  The safety recommendations were prioritized, and seven (7) were recommended for implementation immediately by the NRC Staff.  Regarding new plant licensing, the task force stated in its report that "[t]he Task Force notes that the two design certifications currently in the rulemaking process (i.e., the AP1000 and the economic simplified boiling-water reactor (ESBWR)) have passive safety systems.  By nature of their passive designs and inherent 72-hour coping capability for core, containment, and spent fuel pool cooling with no operator action required, the ESBWR and AP1000 designs have many of the design features and attributes necessary to address the Task Force recommendations.  The Task Force supports completing those design certification rulemaking activities without delay."  The Nuclear Energy Institute, other stakeholders, and the NRC have been working together to finalize Fukushima-related requirements.  NRC orders and 10 CFR 50.54(f) letters will be issued to licensees in 2012. New plants will fall under these same requirements once a license is issued.
 
4.             Major Construction Permits
 
a)             404 Wetlands Permit and 401 Water Quality Certification
 
On December 16, 2011, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) issued the 401 Water Quality Certification for the project, which was required as a basis for the COL and certain other licensing actions related to the Units.  The Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) is now in the process of making a final decision on the 404 Wetlands Permit for the project, which ACOE is anticipated to issue in early 2012.
 
b)           Other Permits
 
On November 18, 2010, SCE&G submitted to SCDHEC a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit application, which would allow SCE&G to discharge blowdown water into the Parr Reservoir. Approval of this application will allow construction to begin on the Raw Water System (RWS) intake structure, the Wastewater System (WWS) and other appurtenances associated with the system.
 
On multiple occasions during its review process, SCDHEC has requested additional information from SCE&G to address internal
comments
regarding the application.  In September 2011, SCDHEC requested an update to SCE&G's permit application to address temperature and chemical mixing regarding 7Q10 water flows in the Broad River.  As a result, SCE&G will resubmit an updated copy of the NPDES application in February 2012.
No other major permits are outstanding.  Other construction-related permits are anticipated to be obtained in the ordinary course
of
administering the project.
 
5.             Base Load Review Act (BLRA) Regulatory Proceedings
 
a)
             On September 30, 2011, the Commission issued Order No. 2011-738 in Docket No. 2011-207-E which approved SCE&G's annual request for revised rates under the terms of the BLRA.  The total rate adjustment authorized was $52,783,342 and reflected an incremental investment by the Company in the Units of $436,725,000.
 
b)
             In early 2012, SCE&G plans to make an Update Filing with the Commission under the authority of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E).  The Update Filing will provide the Commission the opportunity to review and approve revised project construction and cash flow schedules which will reflect an early 2012 issuance date for the COL.  SCE&G has discussed with WEC/Shaw the need to prepare cash flow and milestone schedules for filing in this docket that reflect the Scenario 3 completion dates for the Units.  The updated cash flow forecasts will also include the change orders discussed in Section II, E below, as well as the revised Transmission cost forecasts and the revised Owners cost forecasts that SCE&G is currently finalizing.  The total amount of additional costs that are anticipated to be reflected in this filing is in the range of $170 million.  Under S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E), the Update Filing is to be approved unless shown to be the result of imprudence by the utility.
 
6.
                                     
Utility Facility Siting and Environmental Protection Act Proceedings
 
On January 12, 2012, subsequent to this reporting period, the Commission issued Order No. 2011-978 under the Utility Facility Siting and Environmental Protection Act. That order granted SCE&G's application for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity for construction of three transmission lines associated with the Units.  These transmission lines are necessary to route power from Unit 2 to the grid, and to ensure system reliability while Unit 3 lines are constructed.  The three lines are the VCS1  Killian Line (Killian Line), the VCS2  Lake Murray Line No. 2 (Lake Murray No. 2 Line), and that segment of the VCS2  St. George No. 1 Line that runs between the plant site and the Lake Murray 230/115 kV substation (St. George Segment).  No party has appealed this Order.

Procurement/Fabrication
 
a)
                                     
As previously reported, SMS has been working since 2010 to correct and recover from QA/QC issues and other issues related to module fabrication at its facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
 
In December 2011, SMS provided a re-baselined module fabrication and delivery schedule.  WEC/Shaw management is reviewing this schedule.  CA20 is one of the largest modules to be fabricated and will be installed early in the construction process.  According to the latest module schedule, the on-hook date of Unit 2 module CA20 (., the date by which fabrication is complete and the module is ready to be lifted into place) is now scheduled for November 2012, a delay of 11 months from the current milestone date.  The module schedule continues to be reviewed and optimized and is being coordinated with the overall schedule review taking place under Change Order No. 11.  The delays associated with fabrication and delivery of the modules continues to be an important area of focus for the project.
i.e
 
In its quarterly report for the quarter ending March 31, 2011, and in each quarterly report thereafter, SCE&G informed the Commission and ORS that in January 2011, the NRC was unable to complete a vendor inspection audit of SMS due to the lack of actual production work ongoing.  During the time period November 14, 2011 through November 18, 2011, the NRC conducted a follow-up inspection to the inspection in January 2011 that was terminated early.  By letter
dated January 6, 2012, the NRC provided its inspection report to SMS.
 
b)
                                     
Improvements have been made in the QA/QC matters previously identified by WEC in the production and fabrication of AP1000 components by its supplier, Mangiarotti (MN), and MN sub-suppliers.  MN currently is meeting revised schedule requirements.  Additional WEC QA/QC personnel have been located at the facility to emphasize the importance of maintaining a schedule that supports accomplishment of relevant BLRA milestones within applicable contingencies.  Several BLRA milestones related to MN plant components that were delayed by 12 to 14 months, as indicated in , were completed during the fourth quarter of 2011 and others remain on track.  Delays in the MN milestones are not expected to affect the substantial completion dates of the Units.

Endurance testing of the lead Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) began in April 2011, but was suspended to investigate unexpected temperature data in a localized area within the stator core.  A subsequent investigation was performed and resulted in design
improvements
to the motor to address the unexpected temperature data.  A Proof of Principal Test was then completed, and inspection results confirmed that the improvements in design were successful.  Design changes were then incorporated into production, and the second Endurance Test began in December 2011.  That test was on-going in January 2012.  No delay in the site delivery of the V.C. Summer RCPs is anticipated.
 
d)
                                     
Reactor Coolant Loop (RCL) Piping for the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) being manufactured by Tioga has experienced delays in hot leg manufacturing due primarily to deviation in grain size.  A contingency plan was put in place to accept piping with grain size larger than the current specification requirements should revised manufacturing techniques fail to achieve desired results; however, the revised manufacturing process appears to have resolved the issue.  One BLRA milestone related to RCL piping, as indicated in , was delayed by 13 months, as of December 31, 2011.  However, this delay does not exceed the contingency specified in the BLRA and is not expected to affect the substantial completion dates for the Units.

Construction
 
1.
                                     
Switchyard construction work was previously impacted due to weather delays, late issuance of construction documents for review, and delayed resolution of issues associated with design compliance to the approved Switchyard
specifications.  However, Shaw has since taken action to correct these issues, and the Switchyard is on schedule to be energized in March 2013, a date which fully supports the project schedule.
 
2.
                                     
During the excavation of the Unit 2 power block, the layer of granite bedrock for the NI was found to be deeper than expected. Changes in the elevation of bedrock are not entirely unusual; however, the resulting impact of this discovery is that additional
concrete
fill placement will be required to create the level surface necessary prior to placing the mud mat and vapor barrier for the NI.
 
3.
                                     
Unit 3 excavation continues on schedule.  The top of bedrock was reached for the NI at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011, and geologic mapping is complete.  An NRC Geologic Inspection of the Unit 3 top of surface rock and the geologic mapping program was conducted in October 2011, with favorable results.

The horizontal waterproof membrane material was received onsite at the end of November 2011.  Additional testing of the product at the off-site lab in Boston, MA continues.  The subcontract for installation of waterproof membrane was awarded to Comanco.  Because installation of the membrane is a critical path item for readiness to pour nuclear safety-related concrete, this is an area of focus for the project.
 
7.
                                     
Testing and quality approvals for safety-related concrete mixes continue to prepare for the pouring of the first nuclear concrete for Unit 2 during the first quarter of 2012.  The first three concrete mixes have been redesigned, and the 28-day break for compressive strength was deemed satisfactory.  All mixes necessary for the initial nuclear safety work, i.e., leveling and mudmats, have been approved.  In November of 2011, to prepare for nuclear safety concrete production, structural concrete production was placed on hold and the on-site batch plants began to purge non-safety qualified materials such as aggregate, admixtures, fly-ash, and cement.  The purge of non-safety related concrete materials has been completed.  All these activities are on schedule, but because
they are part of the critical path to allow the placement of the first nuclear concrete, they remain a focus area.

Significant improvements have been made by Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) with regard to onsite Containment Vessel (CV) fabrication.  Safety-related welding began in July 2011.  During the final quarter of 2011, CB&I performed buffing and grinding of the bottom head plates, final fit-up and welding of the bottom head plates mounted on the Bottom Head Erection Stand, and Radiographic Testing of pressure boundary welds.  Though work is progressing, SCE&G continues to monitor CV fabrication closely.

Training
 
1.
                                     
Twelve training instructors for the Units completed Instructor Simulator Training on December 16, 2011, at WEC in Cranberry, PA.  The second group of twelve began this training on January 9, 2012.  The training is scheduled to end in April 2012, which will complete WEC Senior Reactor Operator Certification training for SCE&G instructors.
 
2.
                                     
Potential schedule impacts to simulator delivery, testing, and subsequent certification of the Plant Reference Simulator (PRS) continue to be an area of focus for the project.
 
As reported in previous quarterly reports, in 2011 SCE&G identified issues with the WEC AP1000 Limited Scope Simulators (LSS) that could potentially impact operator training schedules.  Management at SCE&G and WEC/Shaw has been working to resolve these issues, and will continue to monitor the progress closely to ensure training objectives remain on track.
 
3.
                                     
In preparation for receipt of the LSS, work on the simulator rooms of the Nuclear Learning Center (NLC) Annex at Unit 1 is scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of 2012.  Delivery of hardware for the LSS will continue through the month of January 2012.  Installation and testing of this hardware will occur to meet the March 2012 date of when it is anticipated that the AP1000 simulators will be ready to begin use for training activities.

Change Control/Owners Cost Forecast
 
1.
                                     
EPC Contract Amendment No. 2
 Amendment No. 2 to the EPC Contract was fully executed on November 15, 2011, incorporating Change Orders 3 and 5-11 into the body of the EPC Contract.  The amendment is procedural, and there are no new costs
associated
with the execution of the amendment.
2.
                                     
Health Care Mandate Costs (EPC Contract Change Order No. 12)
 During the last quarter of 2011, WEC/Shaw initiated Change Order No. 12 requesting reimbursement for Shaw's increased costs as a result of a change in law related to portions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Health Care Act).  SCE&G approved the change order in December 2011.  The total costs associated with this action are $135,573 and are spread throughout the remaining period of the project.  These costs have been included in the cost forecasts presented here. Although at this time WEC has not quantified any additional costs related to the Health Care Act, additional change orders may be generated by WEC/Shaw to cover future cost impacts associated with the act.
 
3.
                                     
Cyber Security
An agreement was reached between SCE&G and WEC/Shaw on a phased approach to the costs associated with strengthening the Units' defenses against cyber-attack (Cyber Security) as mandated by the NRC. The change order proposal includes a firm price scope of work in the amount of $914,422 that will involve review of the specific equipment and software at issue to identify vulnerabilities and devise a scope of work to protect against cyber-attack.  A change order for the first phase of work is being prepared.  The above costs for implementing the resulting scope of work are estimated to be $4.95 million.  These costs have been included in the cost forecasts presented here.
 
4.
                                     
Liquid Radwaste System
 On December 9, 2011, WEC/Shaw presented SCE&G with an estimate for a detailed scope of work and associated costs for a revision to the design of the LRW discharge piping for gravity drainage, as specified in SCE&G's COL application.  SCE&G currently is reviewing this proposal from WEC/Shaw.  WEC/Shaw has presented a cost for this work of $8,250.  This cost has been included in the cost forecasts for the Units.
 
5.
                                     
Operational Readiness and Other Owners Costs
SCE&G is completing the comprehensive review of its New Nuclear Deployment and Operational Readiness Staffing Plans which has been ongoing since 2008.  The current staffing plan reflects the additional skills, training and experience that will be required for a staff that can safely and efficiently operate the Units.  In addition, the plan reflects the cost for the accelerated hiring and training of staff to meet the Scenario 3 schedule.  The updated Owners cost projections also include the costs of facilities, equipment and information technology (IT) systems required to support the Units and their personnel.  These cost forecasts are being finalized at this time but are anticipated to result in increases to the project cash flow forecast of approximately $150 million.
6.
                                     
Regulatory Delay/New Requirements Costs and Other Associated Costs
 As a result of the study related to COL Delay that was authorized by Change Order No. 11, and other issues subsequently identified by the parties, WEC/Shaw are negotiating potential change orders related to claims by WEC/Shaw for additional compensation associated with design modifications to the shield building and the structural modules (including resulting increases in construction costs for both), delays in NRC licensing, and unanticipated rock conditions where the foundations for the Unit 2 NI will be constructed.  SCE&G has not accepted the validity of these claims.  Costs associated with these items are being negotiated and have not been included in the cost forecast for the Units.
 
7.
                                     
Transmission Costs
 SCE&G has re-forecasted transmission costs associated with the Units based on additional design and engineering
work
, evaluation of power flows, and more current information about right-of-way costs and property requirements.  As discussed in Section II, F below, SCE&G has determined that it is preferable to construct a new Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation as opposed to installing additional autobanks at the Lake Murray 230/115 kV Substation and the Denny Terrace 230/115 kV Substation.  Accommodating power flows from the Units under this new configuration will require upgrading the 115 kV line between the Saluda River substation and the Lyles substation.  Furthermore, SCE&G will add an underground section to the Parr-VCSN Safeguard 115 kV line where that line will be crossed by new lines being built to support the Units.  Undergrounding this section of line will enhance safety and reliability.  As a result of these and other changes and upgrades, transmission cost forecasts have increased by $12.3 million.  These costs have been included in the cost forecast for the Units.

Killian Line 
In early January 2012, in accordance with Order No. 2011-978, SCE&G began construction on the VCS/
Winnsboro
segment of the Killian Line.  Right-of way acquisition for the Killian Line continues with 26 of 51 parcels required having been acquired as of December 31, 2011 and another 6 parcels accessible through condemnation.
 
2.
                                     
Lake Murray #2-230KV Line 
The engineering work on this line is approximately 20% complete.  The segment of the St. George #1-230kV Line from VCS2 to the Lake Murray Substation will be designed and constructed concurrently with this line.  No construction on either line has commenced.
 
3.
                                     
Unit 3 Lines 
SCE&G anticipates filing an application under the Utility Facility Siting and Environmental Protection Act for approval of the Unit 3
lines (VCS2-St. George 230 kV Lines No. 1 & 2, excluding the segment of the No. 1 line filed with the Unit 2 lines) and the St. George Switching Station in the second quarter of 2012.

St. George Switching Station
The site for this switching station was purchased in 2009 and is currently undergoing environmental assessment.
 
5.
                                     
Saluda River Substation
 Based on further review of system conditions and requirements, SCE&G has determined that its original plan to
install
additional autobanks at the Lake Murray 230/115 kV Substation and the Denny Terrace 230/115 kV Substation would require SCE&G to construct new substations adjacent to the two existing substations due to the space limitations at those existing substations.  Because reliability and operations considerations make it preferable not to place numerous transformers in a single location, SCE&G instead will construct a new Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation; the autobanks will not then be required.  One of the St. George lines will fold-in to the new Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation.  Accommodating power flows from the Units under this new configuration (., the Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation configuration), will require upgrading and fold-in of the 115 kV line between the Saluda River substation and the Lyles substation and the 115 kV line between the Saluda Hydro Substation and the Williams Street Substation.  SCE&G is currently in the process of purchasing the site for the new Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation.

Parr-VCSN Safeguard Line
 The Parr-VCSN Safeguard 115 kV line provides back up power to VCS Unit 1.  Design work for other transmission lines supporting the Units has raised reliability and safety issues concerning the multiple 230 kV lines which will cross the 115 kV safeguard line within the VCS plant property.  To alleviate these reliability and safety concerns, a short segment of the Parr-VCSN Safeguard 115 kV line will be rebuilt underground at the site of these multiple crossings.  The associated cost impacts of this work have been estimated and are being further evaluated.

Agreement with Santee Cooper
 
In October 2011, SCE&G and its co-owner in the project, Santee Cooper, executed the permanent construction and operating agreements, which will govern the construction and operation of the new nuclear facilities.  Under these agreements, SCE&G will have primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the Units and will be responsible for the operation of the Units as they come on line.

Schedules of the Capital Costs Incurred Including Updates to the Information Required by S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B)(6) (the Inflation Indices)
 
The Capital Cost section of this report (Section IV.A) provides an update of the cumulative capital costs incurred and forecasted to be incurred in completing the project.  These costs are compared to the cumulative capital cost targets approved by the Commission in Order No. 2011-345.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates.  There has not been any use by the Company of the capital cost timing contingencies that were approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104(A).  The Inflation Indices section (Section IV.B) of this report provides updated information on inflation indices and the changes in them.

Conclusion
 
The construction project is proceeding safely and efficiently.  Since the last quarterly report, the project has met major milestones with the issuance of the 401 permit and the completion of site work required to allow nuclear safety-related construction work to begin. The Units are currently anticipated to be completed at a cost of approximately $4.3 billion (not including anticipated Owner's Cost adjustment and
Challenged Costs) in 2007 dollars.  The Company maintains an extensive staff of experts that monitors and oversees the work of its contractors and has identified and continues to monitor closely all areas of concern related to either cost or schedule for the project.  The Company will continue to update the Commission and ORS of progress and concerns as the project proceeds.
