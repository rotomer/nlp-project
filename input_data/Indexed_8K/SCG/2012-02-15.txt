Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011.
Cayce, S.C., Feb. 15, 2012...
For the year ended December 31, 2011, SCANA reported basic earnings of $387 million or $3.01 per share, compared to $376 million, or $2.99 per share, in 2010.
Our 2011 results were in line with our earnings expectations as we continue to deliver predictable growth for our shareholders, said Jimmy Addison, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I am also very pleased with our continued cost containment efforts during this economic recovery and more broadly, with South Carolinas robust industrial announcements and the related new jobs. 
SCANAs basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $98 million, or 76 cents per share, compared to $94 million, or 74 cents per share, for the same quarter in 2010.  Savings in operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by depreciation, property taxes and share dilution associated with capital investments.
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
Reported earnings for 2011 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANAs principal subsidiary, were $316 million, or $2.46 per share compared to $304 million, or $2.42 per share, in 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2011, SCE&G reported earnings of $65 million, or 50 cents per share, compared to $67 million, or 52 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2010.  The increase in annual earnings was due to higher margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, which were partially offset by higher interest expense, property taxes, depreciation, and share dilution.  At year-end 2011, SCE&G was serving approximately 664,000 electric customers and approximately 317,000 natural gas customers, up 0.5 and 1.1 percent, respectively, over 2010.

PSNC Energy
PSNC Energy, the Companys North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported 2011 earnings of $49 million, or 37 cents per share, compared to $46 million, or 36 cents per share, in 2010.  Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $22 million, or 17 cents per share, compared to $21 million, or 17 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Increases in customer growth were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and property taxes for the year.  At year end, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 487,000 customers, an increase of 1.1 percent over the previous year.
SCANA Energy - Georgia
SCANA Energy, the Companys retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported 2011 earnings of $24 million, or 19 cents per share, compared to $31 million, or 24 cents per share, in 2010. The decrease is attributable to lower throughput due to milder than normal weather.  Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $10 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $10 million, or 7 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2010.  At December 31, 2011, SCANA Energy was serving approximately 455,000 customers, a decrease of approximately 1.9 percent over the prior year.
Corporate and Other, Net
SCANAs corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported a loss of $2 million, or 1 cent per share in 2011, compared to a loss of $4 million, or 3 cents per share in 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2011, these businesses reported earnings of $1 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to a loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The increase is due to improved results at the Companys communications business.
EARNINGS OUTLOOK
The Company reaffirmed its guidance for 2012 basic earnings per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.25, with an internal target of $3.17 per share.
 
 
These estimates assume issuance of the shares pursuant to the 2010 equity forward in late 2012 and exclude any potential impacts from changes in accounting principles and gains or losses from certain investing activities, litigation, and sales of assets.  Other factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement.
