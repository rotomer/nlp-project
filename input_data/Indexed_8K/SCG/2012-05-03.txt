SCANA Reports Financial Results for First Quarter 2012
Cayce, S.C., May 3, 2012...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced basic earnings for the first quarter of 2012 of $121 million, or 93 cents per share, compared to $128 million, or $1.00 per share, for the first quarter of 2011.
The first quarter was historic for SCANA as we received the Combined Construction and Operating Licenses for two new nuclear units, said Jimmy Addison, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Although we experienced one of the mildest winters in several decades, the impact to earnings was tempered by weather normalization mechanisms in our regulated subsidiaries. The decline in first quarter earnings was primarily driven by an 8 cent swing in weather in our non-regulated natural gas business in Georgia. While the mild weather impacted our results for the quarter, our core fundamentals remain unchanged. We continue to offer a business strategy focused on providing reliable power to our customers and long-term growth for our shareholders.
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
Reported earnings in the first quarter of 2012 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, were $72 million, or 55 cents per share compared to $70 million, or 55 cents per share, in 2011. The increase in earnings was due to higher margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, which were offset by higher operating and maintenance expense, interest expense, depreciation, and share dilution. At March 31, 2012, SCE&G was serving approximately 668,000 electric customers and approximately 319,000 natural gas customers, up 0.7 and 1.3 percent, respectively, over 2011.
PSNC Energy
PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported first quarter 2012 earnings of $31 million, or 24 cents per share, compared to $32 million, or 25 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2011. Increases in margins due to customer growth were more than offset by higher operating and maintenance expense and share dilution. At March 31, 2012, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 489,000 customers, an increase of 1.6 percent over the previous year.
SCANA Energy - Georgia
SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported first quarter 2012 earnings of $11 million, or 9 cents per share, compared to $22 million, or 17 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2011. The decrease is attributable to lower throughput due to significantly milder than normal weather. At March 31, 2012, SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers.
Corporate and Other, Net
SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported earnings of $7 million, or 5 cents per share, compared to earnings of $5 million, or 3 cents per share in the first quarter of 2011.
EARNINGS OUTLOOK
The Company reaffirmed its guidance for 2012 basic earnings per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.25. These estimates assume issuance of the shares pursuant to the 2010 equity forward in late 2012 and exclude any potential impacts from changes in accounting principles and gains or losses from certain investing activities, litigation, and sales of assets. Other factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement.
