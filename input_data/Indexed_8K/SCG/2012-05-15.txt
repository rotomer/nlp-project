Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G or the Company) to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the Commission) and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS).  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2011) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104(A).  This report provides updated information concerning the status of the construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSN) Units 2 & 3 (the Units) and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units.  The Commission approved updated construction schedules for the Units in Order No. 2010-12.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules for the Units in Order No. 2011-345 issued on May 16, 2011.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current construction milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104(A).  There are 146 separate milestones.  Of these, 72 have been completed as of March 31, 2012.  Comparing the scheduled milestone completion dates as of the date of this report to the milestone completion dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 66 milestones have changed.  Of these, 21 have been accelerated and 45 have been delayed for between one and 15 months.
 
D.
                                   
Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
Spending through December 31, 2012 in current dollars is forecasted to be approximately $292 million below the capital cost schedule approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The present cash flow forecast indicates that the Company will be able to complete the Units for $4.553 billion in 2007 dollars, which is $283 million above the forecast approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The current cost estimates include a) new forecasts of Owners Cost associated with construction oversight and operational readiness functions of the New Nuclear Deployment (NND) team, b) costs associated with the resolution of claims made by the contractors for the Units, Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC and the Shaw Group (WEC/Shaw), related to design changes and delays in the issuance of the Combined Operating Licenses (COLs) for the Units (WEC/Shaw Claims), c) new forecasts of Transmission cost, and d) change orders under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement (EPC Contract) related to cyber security, health insurance costs, and other matters.  The specific items resulting in these increases are discussed in more detail in Section II.
 
Contemporaneously with the filing of this quarterly report, the Company is filing a petition with the Commission under the authority of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E) (Update Filing) for review and approval of revised construction schedule and cash flow schedules for the project.  This Update Filing is discussed in more detail in Section II.
 
 
In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission recognized that forecasts of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  The current escalation indices were issued in January of 2012 for the period of July-December of 2011 and have been used in forecasting the construction costs for the project that are presented here.  below compares the current capital cost forecast to the forecast presented in the last quarterly report.
Chart A
 
 
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including current escalation, to the forecast on which the Commission relied in adopting Order No. 2011-345.  Chart B shows that the forecasted capital cost of the Units in 2007 dollars has increased by approximately $283 million. This increase reflects the additions to the budget referenced in Section I. D above and is explained in more detail in Section II of this report.  It is offset by the voluntary decision by the Company, communicated to the Commission by letter dated April 25, 2011, that it would not seek recovery for $103,000 in Community Support/Outreach costs that WEC/Shaw had included in costs to be charged under the EPC Contract for the Units. Due to the changes in forecasted escalation, when netted against changes in AFUDC, see Section I. F, below, the cost of the plant in future dollars has decreased by approximately $25 million since Order No. 2011-345 was issued.

Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104(A), the most current one year inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  The most current escalation indices are found in the Handy-Whitman January 2012 update which was issued in May 2012 and reports data for the period July-December of 2011. Those rates are reflected in this report.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates.  The forecasted costs provided here reflect the terms of the preliminary agreement related to the WEC/Shaw Claims which changes the index applicable to Firm with Indexed Adjustment cost categories going forward from a floating Handy Whitman adjustment to a fixed rate for the life of the project.
 
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have dropped.    Current escalation rates are shown on , below. When compared to the previous quarter, the current update shows a downward trend in rates.

AFUDC
 
The AFUDC for the project is currently projected to be approximately $17.8 million lower than the forecast on which Order No. 2011-345 was based.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104(A), SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's projected AFUDC rate is currently 5.28% versus a rate of 5.87% that applied when Order No. 2011-345 was issued.
 
G.
                                  
Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
The current approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target for the project was adopted by the Commission in Order No. 2011-345.  In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data.
 
 
Appendix 2
provides the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up until December, 2011, have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates.  The cash flow targets for the first quarter of 2012 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices, which for purposes of this report, are the indices provided in May of 2012 that report data through December 31, 2011.  When actual indices for the period January 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012, become available, the cash flow data for the first and second quarters of 2012 will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the project cash flow targets presented on for 2011 and 2012 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order No. 2009-104(A).  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, WEC/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to target calculationsto offset the timing differences that arise as a result of WEC/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits.  This adjustment applies to those EPC contract cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
On March 30, 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued the COLs for the Units.  This represents the successful completion of a major milestone in the construction project.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) issued the 404 Wetlands permit for the project on the same day.
 
Immediately following receipt of the COLs, SCE&G issued several Limited Notices to Proceed to WEC/Shaw which allowed the initial placing of nuclear safety-related concrete for Unit 2 to begin during the week of April 2, 2012.  On April 19, 2012, SCE&G issued a Full Notice to Proceed to WEC/Shaw, which represents another major milestone for the project and allows all remaining safety-related work to commence.  Mobilization is underway for Cooling Tower 2B construction work that was delayed pending issuance of the 404 Wetlands permit.
On March 29, 2012, a preliminary agreement was signed by Senior Management of SCE&G and WEC/Shaw resolving the WEC/Shaw Claims, which included claims for additional charges associated with the delayed issuance of the COLs, the Shield Building design changes, the structural modules design changes, and the lower than anticipated
 
 
rock elevations encountered in certain areas where the Unit 2 Nuclear Island (NI) will be constructed.  In the preliminary agreement, the Parties have agreed to the costs adjustments that will be made to the EPC Contract to resolve the WEC/Shaw Claims and other terms of their settlement.  The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith toward the execution of a final agreement based on the terms of the preliminary agreement. The preliminary agreement also reflects the intention of the parties that the Substantial Completion Dates of the Units will be revised to March 15, 2017 and May 15, 2018, respectively.
 
On May 15, 2012, contemporaneously with the filing of this quarterly report, SCE&G made an Update Filing with the Commission under the authority of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E).  The Update Filing will provide the Commission with the opportunity to review and approve revised project construction and cash flow schedules which reflect a) the March 30, 2012 issuance date for the COLs, b) the revised Substantial Completion Dates for the Units of March 15, 2017 and May 15, 2018, c) the negotiated settlement of the WEC/Shaw Claims totaling $137.5 million, d) revised Owners Costs forecasts totaling $131.6 million, e) revised Transmission cost forecasts totaling $7.9 million, and f) change orders to the EPC Contract related to cyber security, health insurance costs and other matters totaling $5.9 million.  All of these items are discussed in additional detail in Section II.  The total amount of additional costs that are reflected in this filing is approximately $283 million.
 
Prior to the May 15, 2012 Update Filing, SCE&G withdrew an earlier update filing made on February 29, 2012.  That earlier filing predated the issuance of the COLs and the preliminary agreement with WEC/Shaw concerning the WEC/Shaw Claims.
 
Under S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E), the Update Filing is to be approved unless the updates are shown to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  By statute, the Commission is required to issue an order approving or denying the petition by November 16, 2012.
 
Fabrication of equipment off-site continues to proceed well or has shown improvement and is on a schedule that supports the on-site construction schedule, with the exception of sub-modules from the Shaw Modular Solutions (SMS) facility.  Accordingly, SMS remains a significant area for focus to the project. This work has been delayed due to module redesign, production issues, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) issues.  SMS is in the process of resolving these issues.  SCE&G continues to monitor this area carefully and considers it to be a focus area for the project.
The project maintains a safety record that is unprecedented for a heavy construction site of its size.  Since construction began over three years ago, the project has accumulated over 5 million safe-work hours, with a small number of recordable injuries and only three lost time incidents.  The most recent lost time incident occurred in
 
April of 2012, thereby stopping the project's current streak for consecutive safe-work hours.
 
At present all milestone completion dates are within approved schedule contingencies.
 
A more detailed presentation of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.

Licensing and Permitting
 
1.
                                     
COLs
 
On March 30, 2012, the NRC issued a COL to SCE&G for each AP1000 unit, which is V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3.  Issuance of the COLs provided SCE&G with the authority required under the statutes administered by the NRC to construct and operate the Units and allowed nuclear safety-related construction work to begin.  As a result of the issuance of the COLs, SCE&G is now the holder of an active nuclear construction and operating license for each unit and SCE&G's construction and operating activities are subject to an elevated level of oversight and accountability by the NRC.

NRC Inspections
 
a)
                                    
Completed Inspections
 
During the week of March 19, 2012, the NRC conducted an information gathering trip for the management of an Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) inspection which is planned for May 14  18, 2012.
 
During the week of April 2, 2012, the NRC conducted a containment vessel welding inspection.  This inspection examined the techniques, materials, and testing methods used to assemble the containment vessel.  The NRC inspection team completed the inspection with no findings.
 
The NRC also maintains on-site inspectors that perform inspection duties that are summarized in quarterly inspection reports.
 
 
b)
                                    
Upcoming Inspections
 
During the week of May 14, 2012, the NRC will be conducting inspections to review four areas: (1) the reporting of parts and material defects; (2) management of ITAACs, (3) quality assurance, and (4) nuclear island civil work.
 
On May 22, 2012, the NRC Chairman, Gregory B. Jaczko, is scheduled to visit the site.
 
On May 24, 2012, the NRC will conduct a public meeting/open house regarding Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station Unit 1 annual assessment and NRC construction oversight of Units 2 and 3 COLs.
 
NRC inspections related to implementation of the site quality assurance program and corrective action program are planned to be conducted later this year.  Additional NRC inspections are expected to be conducted during the remainder of the year.
 
3.
                                     
NRC Response to the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami of March 2011
 
On March 30, 2012, the NRC issued to SCE&G COLs for Units 2 & 3 that contained a license condition to address the beyond-design-basis event mitigation recommendation provided by the Near Term Task Force (NTTF).  This condition must be fulfilled by SCE&G prior to fuel load and operation of the new plants.  This condition also required SCE&G to provide written confirmation to the NRC within 20 days from the date of the license acknowledging its acceptance of those requirements associated with it.  SCE&G has informed the NRC that it accepts the condition placed upon the COLs.
 
The NRC also issued a concurrent order with the COLs that addresses spent fuel pool monitoring instrumentation (Order EA-12-063).  This order places the same requirements on SCE&G for spent fuel pool monitoring instrumentation as those issued to other licensees on March 12, 2012.  It also required SCE&G to respond to the NRC within 20 days with a confirmatory letter accepting the requirements of the order.  SCE&G has informed the NRC that it accepts the condition placed upon the COLs.
 
In addition, the NRC issued a Request for Information (RFI) on April 13, 2012, to SCE&G requiring a descriptive plan indicating how Units 2 & 3 will supply power to communications systems required by the site emergency plan and information about staffing levels necessary to execute that plan during an
 
emergency event involving multiple units.  This RFI also required a 30-day written acknowledgement to the NRC accepting the requirements of the RFI or indicating inability to comply.  SCE&G has informed the NRC that it will comply with the timelines for supplying the requested information.
 
SCE&G is actively engaged in efforts to address the NTTF recommendations as detailed in its associated COL license condition, NRC Order EA-12-063, and the RFI issued in April.  In addition, SCE&G is involved in a collaborative endeavor by the nuclear industry to develop and implement site-specific, diverse and flexible mitigation strategies that strive to reduce the risks associated with beyond-design-basis conditions.  This approach, which is being led by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), is referred to within the industry as "FLEX".  SCE&G is coordinating its efforts related to FLEX through industry groups to maximize its response effectiveness while minimizing costs.

Major Construction Permits
 
a)
                                    
404 Wetlands Permit
 
The USACOE issued the 404 Wetlands Permit for the project on March 30, 2012.  This has allowed WEC/Shaw to begin work on Cooling Tower 2B and for work to begin on other water supply and discharge structures.
 
b)
                              
Other Permits
 
In early February 2012, SCE&G submitted to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) an updated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit application. The updated permit application addressed questions raised by SCDHEC concerning temperature and chemical mixing under 7Q10 water flow conditions in the Broad River.  Approval of this updated application will allow SCE&G to discharge blowdown water from the Units into the Parr Reservoir and to begin construction on the Raw Water System (RWS) intake structure, the Wastewater System (WWS) and other appurtenances associated with the water and wastewater systems.  The draft permit was placed on public notice on March 30, 2012 by SCDHEC, allowing a 30-day period for comments that ended on April 30, 2012.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has requested until June 11, 2012 to review the application.
 
No other major permits are outstanding.  Other construction-related permits are anticipated to be obtained in the ordinary course of administering the project.

Base Load Review Act (BLRA) Regulatory Proceedings
 
On May 15, 2012, contemporaneously with the filing of this quarterly report, SCE&G made an Update Filing with the Commission under the authority of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E).  The Update Filing will provide the Commission with the opportunity to review and approve revised project construction and cash flow schedules reflecting current substantial completion dates for the Units, the resolution of the WEC/Shaw Claims (all as set forth in the preliminary agreement with WEC/Shaw) totaling $137.5 million, revised Owners costs totaling $131.6 million, revised Transmission costs totaling $7.9 million, and other change orders associated with cyber security, health care costs and other matters totaling $5.9 million.  The total amount of additional costs that are reflected in this Update Filing is approximately $283 million.
 
Prior to the May 15, 2012 Update Filing, SCE&G withdrew an earlier update filing made on February 29, 2012.  That earlier filing predated the issuance of the COLs and the preliminary agreement resolving the WEC/Shaw Claims.  The adjustments that were included in the initial update filing have been revised in the new Update Filing.
 
Under S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E), the Update Filing is to be approved unless the schedule and cost updates are shown to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  By statute, the Commission is required to issue an order approving or denying the petition by November 16, 2012.

Utility Facility Siting and Environmental Protection Act Proceedings
 
As previously reported, in early January 2012 the Commission issued Order No. 2011-978 that granted SCE&G a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity for construction of three transmission lines associated with the Units.  These transmission lines are necessary to route power to the grid, and to ensure system reliability while Unit 3 lines are constructed.  The three lines are the VCS1  Killian Line (Killian Line), the VCS2  Lake Murray Line No. 2 (Lake Murray No. 2 Line), and that segment of the VCS2  St. George No. 1 Line that runs between the plant site and the Lake Murray 230/115 kV substation (St. George Segment).  No party has appealed this order.

Engineering Completion Status
 
The V.C. Summer Units 2 & 3 Total Plant Design Completion Status is as follows:
 
a)
            
Site specific design  85.3% complete.(1)
 
b)
            
Standard Plant Issued for Construction (IFC) Drawings  40.7% complete.
 
2.
                                     
Site Specific Design Activities
 
Site specific design work is ongoing in support of site specific systems, to include the Circulating Water System, Yard Fire System, Potable Water System, RWS, Sanitary Drain System, Offsite Water System (OWS) and WWS.
 
Environmental testing to support OWS design efforts has revealed out-of-specification levels of disinfectant byproducts that were determined to be caused by the presence of bromides in the Broad River.  The project is evaluating changes to the water treatment design for the OWS to address the presence of bromides.
 
In addition, phosphate discharges into the Parr Reservoir are currently limited by SCDHEC due to the elevated level of phosphates otherwise occurring in the Broad River.  These limits on phosphate discharges will require additional evaluation of plant discharges, and ultimately may result in design changes to waste water treatment processes planned for the Units.  These issues are being addressed to ensure the best path forward for the project.
 
(1)  The percentage of completion for site specific design for the quarter ending March 31, 2012 decreased when compared to the percentage of completion for site specific design for the quarter ending December 31, 2011.  Additional site specific design work scope was incorporated into the planned site specific design work scheduled for the first quarter of 2012 thereby leading to an increase in the number of hours required to complete certain design work activities.  While the project was able to complete its planned site specific design work schedule for completion during the first quarter of 2012, the incremental site specific design work that was added to the project caused the overall percentage of completion for site specific design work to decrease during the first quarter of 2012.

The delays related to fabrication and delivery of the modules by SMS at its facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana continue to be an important area of focus for the project.  Notwithstanding these delays, SCE&G has received on-site from SMS four wall submodules that form part of module CA-20 as well as four floor submodules.
 
On several occasions since 2010, SMS has re-baselined the initial module fabrication and delivery schedule; however, SMS has not yet provided SCE&G with a module fabrication and delivery schedule which takes into account the current status of the project.  Efforts continue at a senior level to ensure that SMS addresses and corrects QA/QC and other issues related to module fabrication.  Senior management from both SCE&G and WEC/Shaw continue to collaborate to determine a path forward.  Currently, WEC personnel provide on-site engineering support for production at SMS.  At the outset of the project, SCE&G representatives visited SMS on a quarterly basis.  In light of SMS's performance, SCE&G increased its presence at SMS by conducting monthly visits which then led to weekly visits.  In March 2012, SCE&G established a permanent, resident inspector at the SMS facility to provide additional oversight, reporting and support.
 
During November of 2011, the NRC conducted a follow-up inspection to an inspection conducted in January 2011 that was terminated early.  By letter dated January 6, 2012, the NRC provided its inspection report to SMS.  Several QA/QC issues were addressed, and remain open at the time of this filing.  The NRC has scheduled an inspection of SMS at the Lake Charles facility in May 2012.  Due to issuance of the COLs, the results of this upcoming inspection will now be on SCE&G's License Docket and as license holder, SCE&G will be accountable for compliance.
 
b)
                                    
Currently, Mangiarotti (MN) is meeting quality and schedule expectations for the components it is manufacturing.  Additional WEC personnel have been located at the facility to ensure that MN continues to maintain required levels of QA/QC and does not allow further schedule delays to arise.  At the time of this filing, one BLRA milestone related to MN plant components is delayed by 15 months, as indicated in .  Delays in the MN milestones are not expected to affect the substantial completion dates of the Units.

Endurance Testing of the lead AP1000 Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) which is being supplied to an AP1000 construction project in China was successfully completed in March of 2012 with no issues.  V.C. Summer RCP fabrication is proceeding on schedule.
 
d)
                                    
Reactor Coolant Loop (RCL) Piping for the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) being manufactured by Tioga previously experienced delays in hot leg manufacturing due primarily to deviation in grain size.  A BLRA milestone related to RCP piping was delayed by 13 months as of December 31, 2011.  However, successful efforts to mitigate further delay have resulted in the completion of the milestone on March 19, 2012, as indicated in .

Construction
 
1.
                                     
Switchyard construction work is progressing well, and the Switchyard is on schedule to be energized in the first half of 2013, which fully supports the project schedule.
 
2.
                                     
Receipt of the COLs allowed safety-related dental concrete placement to begin in the Unit 2 NI.
 
3.
                                     
Excavation of the Unit 3 Power Block continues with drilling and blasting of rock in the NI, and is on track for completion in the June/July 2012 timeframe.
 
4.
                                     
Thus far, a total of four wall submodules that form part of module CA-20 have arrived on-site.  They are CA20-02, CA20-06, CA20-07, and CA20-08B.  There also are four floor submodules on-site at this time:  CA20-34, CA20-38, CA20-61 and CA20-42.  Several other submodules are near completion and are estimated to be shipped to the site within the next few weeks.  One of the submodules that is anticipated to ship shortly is CA20-01.  When it arrives, Shaw can begin on-site welding of Unit 2 module CA20.
 
5.
                                     
Assembly of the Heavy Lift Derrick (HLD) was completed, and the boom was raised.  Three hundred (300) ton load testing was completed successfully, and functional testing is ongoing.
 
6.
                                     
The onsite fabrication of the Containment Vessel (CV) by Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) is progressing well.  CB&I has completed final welding of the BH2/BH3 circumferential weld joint on the Bottom Head Erection Stand and Radiographic Testing (RT) of pressure boundary welds.  Assembly of the Ring 1 Erection Stand has been completed on Pad 3 and is ready for erection of Ring 1 in accordance with the current schedule.  Schedule improvements continue to be made by the CB&I CV fabrication team with the utilization of two production shifts.
 
 
7.
                                     
The NRC recently questioned certain changes made to the specifications for constructing the reinforcement steel  or rebar  cages that will ultimately be placed into the excavation site of the Units.  According to the NRC, the changes made to the construction specifications should have been pre-approved by the NRC prior to the work being undertaken.  As a result, construction of the rebar cages has ceased.  To date, no rebar cages have been placed into the excavation site for the Units, and the construction schedule does not require the placement of rebar cages into the excavation site until a later date.  In the meantime, SCE&G and WEC/Shaw are working with the NRC to establish a mutually satisfactory resolution of the issue.

Training
 
1.
                                     
The second group of twelve training instructors for the Units completed Instructor Simulator Training on April 13, 2012, at WEC in Cranberry, PA.  This completes the WEC Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) Certification training process for SCE&G instructors.  All future instructor SRO certifications will be conducted onsite using SCE&G instructors.
 
2.
                                     
Simulator hardware for the Unit 2/3 Limited Scope Simulators (LSS) has been delivered and installed in the Nuclear Learning Center (NLC) Annex simulator rooms.  Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) of the Unit 2 Simulator has been performed and discrepancies have been communicated to WEC/Shaw.  The Unit 3 SAT is in progress.  Issues related to delivery of the LSS software models, and subsequent delivery of the Plant Reference Simulator (PRS), continue to be a challenge, and present potential risks to the schedule for Initial Licensed Operator (ILO) training and examinations.  Human Factors Engineering/Integrated Systems Validation (HFE/ISV) testing on the LSS at WEC previously scheduled to begin in May 2012 has been postponed by WEC.  Senior level management from SCE&G and WEC/Shaw are proactively working to mitigate potential schedule impacts to simulator delivery, testing, and subsequent certification of the PRS.

Ovation Workstations (EPC Contract Change Order No. 13)
 This change order represents a "no-cost" change order under which WEC/Shaw will provide three (3) Ovation Workstations in addition to those supplied with the
 
 
Standard Plant. It was approved by SCE&G in March of 2012.  As part of the preliminary agreement between SCE&G and WEC/Shaw, this
Change
Order also provides a computerized system which supports use of the LSS and revision of Emergency and Abnormal Operating Procedures.
 
3.
                                     
Cyber Security (EPC Contract Change Order No. 14)
A Change Order was executed on March 15, 2012, authorizing a phased approach to the costs associated with strengthening the Units' defenses against cyber-attack (Cyber Security) as mandated by the NRC. The change order includes a firm price scope of work that will involve review of the specific equipment and software at issue to identify vulnerabilities and devise a scope of work to protect against cyber-attack.  These costs, as well as estimates of additional costs for implementing the resulting scope of work are included in the current cost forecasts.
 
4.
                                     
Liquid Waste System
 On March 15, 2012, SCE&G approved a Change Order for a detailed scope of work and associated costs for a revision to the design of the liquid waste discharge piping for gravity drainage.  This cost has been included in the forecasts for the Units.
(EPC Contract Change Order No. 15)
 
5.
                                     
Operational Readiness and Other Owners Costs
SCE&G has completed the comprehensive review of its New Nuclear Deployment and Operational Readiness Staffing Plans which had been ongoing since 2008.  The current staffing plan reflects the additional skills, training and experience that will be required for a staff that can safely and efficiently operate the Units.  In addition, the plan reflects the cost for the accelerated hiring and training of staff to meet the schedule outlined in the preliminary agreement between SCE&G and WEC/Shaw to change the substantial completion dates of the Units.  The updated Owners costs also include updated cost projections for information systems, facilities and other items.
 
6.
                                     
Regulatory Delay/New Requirements Costs and Other Associated Costs
 As indicated in previous reports, Change Order No. 11 addressed COL Delay and other related issues.  As discussed earlier in Section II, SCE&G and WEC/Shaw have reached a preliminary agreement concerning claims by WEC/Shaw for additional charges associated with design modifications to the shield building and the structural modules (including resulting increases in construction costs for both), delays in NRC licensing, and unanticipated rock conditions where the foundations for the Unit 2 NI will be constructed (WEC/Shaw Claims).  Costs associated with the WEC/Shaw Claims have been included in the updated cost forecast for the Units.  In addition, the preliminary agreement fixes the escalation on the Fixed with Indexed Adjustment Category
going forward for the life of the project.  These amounts were previously escalated based on the Handy-Whitman Indices.  The Handy Whitman Indices will continue to be used in forecasting non-firm (Target) cost categories, Actual Craft Wages, Non-Labor Costs and Time & Materials.

Transmission Costs
 SCE&G has updated forecasted transmission costs associated with the Units based on additional design and engineering work, evaluation of power flows, and current information about right-of-way costs.  As discussed in Section II, F below, SCE&G has determined that it is preferable to construct a new Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation rather than installing additional autobanks at the Lake Murray 230/115 kV Substation and the Denny Terrace 230/115 kV Substation.  SCE&G will also perform terminal and bus upgrades at the Canadys, Summerville and Saluda Hydro substations.  Further, SCE&G will underground a section of the Parr-VCSN Safeguard 115 kV line.  Undergrounding this section of line will enhance safety and reliability.  As a result of these and other changes and upgrades, transmission cost forecasts have increased by $7.9 million.  These updated costs have been included in the forecast for the Units.

Transmission
 
1.
                                     
Killian Line 
In early January 2012, in accordance with Order No. 2011-978, SCE&G began construction on the VCS-Winnsboro segment of the Killian Line.  As of March 31, 2012, this first segment (approximately 13 miles) was about 80% complete.  Right-of-way acquisition for the Blythewood-Killian segment continues with 31 of 50 required parcels having been acquired as of March 31, 2012, and another 16 parcels accessible through condemnation.  As noted in Section II, E, 7 above, additional right-of-way acquisition costs will be incurred.
 
2.
                                     
Lake Murray 230 kV Line No. 2 
This line and the segment of the St. George 230 kV Line No. 1 from VCS2 to the Lake Murray Substation share the same (double circuit) structure.  Engineering & design is approximately 53% complete.  No construction has commenced.
 
3.
                                     
Unit 3 Lines 
SCE&G anticipates filing an application under the Utility Facility Siting and Environmental Protection Act for approval of the Unit 3 lines (VCS2-St. George 230 kV Lines No. 1 & 2, excluding the segment of the No. 1 line filed with the Unit 2 lines) and associated facilities in the second quarter of 2012.
 
4.
                                     
St. George Switching Station
The site for this switching station was purchased in 2009 and is currently undergoing environmental assessment.
5.
                                     
Saluda River Substation
 Based on further review of system conditions and requirements, SCE&G determined a new Saluda River 230/115kV substation is preferable to its original plan to install additional autobanks at its existing Lake Murray 230/115 kV and Denny Terrace 230/115 kV Substations. Space limitations within these substations would have dictated the construction of new additions adjacent to the existing substations. Further, reliability and operations considerations make it preferable not to place numerous transformers in a single location.  SCE&G is currently in the process of purchasing the site for the new Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation that is adjacent to the St. George lines corridor. One of the St. George lines will fold-in to the new substation. Accommodating power flows from the Units under this new configuration (., the Saluda River 230/115 kV Substation configuration) will require upgrading and fold-in of the 115 kV line between the Saluda River substation and the Lyles substation
i.e
 
6.
                                     
Parr-VCSN Safeguard Line
 The Parr-VCSN Safeguard 115 kV line provides back up power to VCSN Unit 1.  The existing routing of the Safeguard line and routing of four of the new transmission lines supporting the new Units resulted in an unavoidable, multiple 230 kV line crossing of the Safeguard line within the VCS plant property.  To alleviate reliability and safety concerns, a short segment of the Parr-VCSN Safeguard 115 kV line will be rebuilt underground at the location of these multiple crossings.
 
7.
                                     
Terminal and Bus Upgrades at Canadys, Summerville and Saluda Hydro Substation 
Transmission line conductor upgrades planned as result of the new units also require the associated substation line terminal(s) to be upgraded.  One terminal upgrade is required at Canadys Substation, one at Summerville Substation and two terminal upgrades at Saluda Hydro Substation.  The 230 kV bus conductor must also be upgraded at the Canadys Substation.
 
8.
                                     
Parr-
Midway
115 kV Line 
The existing Parr-Midway 115 kV transmission line parallels and runs near the new VCS2 switchyard.  As a result of detail design and routing for the 230 kV transmission lines terminating into the new switchyard, the Parr-Midway line has been lowered to meet required minimum National Electric Safety Code crossing clearances.

Conclusion
 
The construction project is proceeding safely and efficiently.  Since the last quarterly report, the project has met major milestones with the issuance of the COLs, 404 Permit and Full Notice to Proceed.  The Units are currently anticipated to be completed at a cost of approximately $4.6 billion in 2007 dollars.  The Company maintains an extensive staff of experts that monitors and oversees the work of its contractors and has identified and continues to monitor closely all areas of concern related to either cost or schedule for the project.  The Company will continue to update the Commission and ORS of progress and concerns as the project proceeds.
