SCANA Reports Financial Results for Second Quarter 2012
Cayce, S.C., August 2, 2012...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced basic earnings for the second quarter of 2012 of $72 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $56 million, or 44 cents per share, for the second quarter of 2011. During the second quarter, increases in electric and gas margins principally from base rate increases were partially offset by increases in operations and maintenance, interest, depreciation, and property tax expenses, and share dilution.
For the first six months of 2012, SCANA reported basic earnings of $193 million, or $1.48 per share, compared to $184 million, or $1.44 per share, for the same period in 2011.
We are pleased with the results for the second quarter. Margins were higher than last year and more than offset growth in expenses, said Jimmy Addison, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Year to date, increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to the mild weather in the first quarter, along with higher expenses related to our capital program, such as depreciation, property taxes, and interest. We will continue to maintain focus on controlling our operating and maintenance expenses for the remainder of the year. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year and maintain our internal target of $3.17 per share.
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2012 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANAs principal subsidiary, were $78 million, or 59 cents per share compared to $61 million, or 48 cents per share, in 2011. The increase in earnings was due to higher margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, which were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense, depreciation, and share dilution. At June 30, 2012, SCE&G was serving approximately 669,000 electric customers and approximately 318,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8 and 1.5 percent, respectively, over 2011.
PSNC Energy
Reported earnings for PSNC Energy, the Companys North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, were flat for the second quarter of 2012, compared to a loss of less than $1 million, or 1 cent per share, in the second quarter of 2011. Increases in margin due to customer growth were offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses. At June 30, 2012, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 484,000 customers, an increase of 1.9 percent over the previous year.
SCANA Energy - Georgia
SCANA Energy, the Companys retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $3 million, or 2 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2012, consistent with the results from the second quarter of 2011.
