Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current construction milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104(A).  There are 146 separate milestones.  As of June 30, 2012, 76 have been completed.  Comparing the scheduled milestone completion dates as of the date of this report to the milestone completion dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 64 milestones have changed.  Of these, 21 have been accelerated and 43 have been delayed for between one and 16 months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
Spending through December 31, 2012 in current dollars is forecasted to be approximately $295 million below the capital cost schedule approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The present cash flow forecast indicates that the Company will be able to complete the Units for $4.553 billion in 2007 dollars, which is $283 million above the forecast approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The current cost estimates include a) new forecasts of Owners Cost associated with the construction oversight and operational readiness functions of the New Nuclear Deployment (NND) team, b) costs associated with the resolution of claims made by the contractors for the Units, Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC and the Shaw Group (WEC/Shaw), related to design changes and delays in the issuance of the Combined Operating Licenses (COLs) for the Units (WEC/Shaw Claims), c) new forecasts of Transmission cost, and d) change orders under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement (EPC Contract) related to cyber security, health insurance costs, and other matters.  The specific items resulting in these increases are discussed in more detail in Section II.
On May 15, 2012, the Company filed a petition with the Commission under the authority of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E) (Update Filing) for review and approval of revised construction schedule and cash flow schedules for the project.  This Update Filing is discussed in more detail in Section II.
In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission recognized that forecasts of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) expense and escalation would vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  The current escalation indices were issued in May of 2012 for the period of July-December of 2011 and have been used in forecasting the construction costs for the project that are presented here.
 
Chart A
below compares the current capital cost forecast to the forecast presented in the last quarterly report.  This chart shows an increase in Gross Construction Costs of $2.1 million over the life of the project.  This increase is due in part to the differential in one-year and five-year Handy-Whitman escalation rates.  With each quarterly update, a quarter that had been subject to the five-year rate becomes subject to the one-year rate.  As shown on found in Section I.E, below, the one-year rate currently is higher than the five-year rate for all non-transmission Handy-Whitman indices.  The figures reported on also include the effect of calculating escalation on an updated cost flow projection for the project.
Chart D
Chart A
 
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including current escalation, to the forecast on which the Commission relied in adopting Order No. 2011-345.  Chart B shows that the forecasted capital cost of the Units in 2007 dollars has increased by approximately $283 million.  This increase reflects the additions to the budget referenced in Section I. D above and is explained in more detail in Section II of this report.  It is offset by the voluntary decision by the Company, communicated to the Commission by letter dated April 25, 2011, that it would not seek recovery for $103,000 in Community Support/Outreach costs that WEC/Shaw had included in costs to be charged under the EPC Contract for the Units. Due to the changes in forecasted escalation, when netted against changes in AFUDC, see Section I. F, below, the cost of the plant in future dollars has decreased by approximately $23 million since Order No. 2011-345 was issued.
 
 
Chart C
below shows the current forecasts of the cost of the Units compared to the cost forecasts underlying the initial Base Load Review Act (BLRA) order, which was issued by the Commission in 2009, and the updated orders issued in 2010 and 2011.  The decline in capital costs forecasts in 2007 dollars between Order No. 2010-12 and 2011-345 reflects the removal of Owner's contingency amounts from the forecasts as required by the opinion of the Supreme Court of South Carolina in , 388 S.C. 486, 697 S.E.2d 587 (2010).  This chart shows that while the cost of the project in 2007 dollars has increased by $18 million since the initial forecasts, the cost of the project in future dollars is approximately $549 million below the initial forecast.

Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104(A), the most current one-year inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  The most current escalation indices are found in the Handy-Whitman January 2012 update which was issued in May 2012 and reports data for the period July-December of 2011.  Those rates are reflected in this report.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates.  The forecasted costs provided here reflect the terms of the agreement related to the WEC/Shaw Claims which changes the index applicable to Firm with Indexed Adjustment
cost categories going forward from a floating Handy-Whitman adjustment to a fixed rate for the life of the project.
 
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have dropped.  Current escalation rates are shown below on .  When compared to the previous Handy-Whitman release, the current update shows a downward trend in rates.

AFUDC
 
The AFUDC for the project is currently projected to be approximately $17.4 million lower than the forecast on which Order No. 2011-345 was based.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104(A), SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's projected AFUDC rate is currently 5.28% versus a rate of 5.87% that applied when Order No. 2011-345 was issued.
 
G.
                                  
Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
The current approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target for the project was adopted by the Commission in Order No. 2011-345.  In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data.
 
Appendix 2
provides the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up until December 2011 have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates.  The cash flow targets for the first quarter of 2012 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices, which for purposes of this report, are the indices provided in May of 2012 that report data for the period July through December 2011.  When actual indices for the period January 1, 2012 to June 30, 2012, become available, the cash flow data for the first and second quarters of 2012 will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the project cash flow targets presented on for 2011 and 2012 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order No. 2009-104(A).  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, WEC/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to target calculationsto offset the timing differences that arise as a result of WEC/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits.  This adjustment applies to those EPC Contract cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Following the issuance of the COLs for the Units by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and receipt of the 404 Wetlands Permit, SCE&G issued limited notices to proceed to WEC/Shaw on April 4, 2012, allowing placement of the first nuclear safety-related concrete and cooling tower work to begin on Cooling Tower Unit 2A.  SCE&G then issued a Full Notice to Proceed (FNTP) to WEC/Shaw on April 19, 2012.  Since that time, work has progressed safely and efficiently on the project site.  As of June 30, 2012, WEC/Shaw had placed over 10,000 cubic yards of concrete for the Unit 2 Nuclear Island (NI) and over 8,000 cubic yards of concrete for the Unit 2 turbine building.  Other work on the site is proceeding well.
The project continues to maintain an impressive safety record for a heavy construction site of its size, complexity and technical challenges.  Emphasis is placed on reporting of near misses and minor injuries.  These lead to early identification of precursors to more significant injuries allowing steps to be taken to minimize them.  Since construction began over three years ago, there have been a relatively small number of recordable injuries and only five lost-time incidents in over six million hours worked.
 
Overall, the fabrication of equipment off-site is proceeding satisfactorily on a schedule that supports the on-site construction schedule.  However, the schedule for fabrication of sub-modules from the Shaw Modular Solutions (SMS) facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana remains a significant focus area for the project. This submodule fabrication work has been delayed due to module redesign delays, production issues, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) issues.  SMS is in the process of resolving these issues and preparing plans to recover from past delays.  SCE&G continues to monitor and oversee this area carefully and is devoting significant resources and attention to this area.
 
On July 30, 2012, Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the Shaw Group which it plans to operate as a business sector under the name CB&I Shaw.  The acquisition is not anticipated to affect the project in any materially adverse way.
 
As previously reported, a preliminary agreement was signed in March 2012 by Senior Management of SCE&G and WEC/Shaw resolving the claims associated with the delayed issuance of the COLs, design changes to the Shield Building, design changes to the structural modules, and the lower than anticipated rock elevations encountered in certain areas where the Unit 2 NI will be constructed.  This agreement was finalized on July 11, 2012, and reflects new Substantial Completion Dates for Units 2 and 3 of March 15, 2017 and May 15, 2018, respectively.
At present all Base Load Review Act (BLRA) milestone completion dates are within approved schedule contingencies.  Based on BLRA milestone updates received from WEC/Shaw in early August, after the close of the reporting period, four milestones have been delayed by 16 months:  Milestone No. 61, Core Make-Up Tank Hydro Test; Milestone No. 101, Set Unit 2 Containment Vessel; Milestone No. 107, Set Unit 2 Reactor Vessel; and Milestone No. 112, Set Unit 2 Steam Generator.  However, none of these milestone delays will affect the construction-need date of the activities in question.  The updated completion dates for all milestones are listed in Appendix 1.
 
A more detailed presentation of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.
A.
                                   
Licensing and Permitting
 
As licensee for the Units, SCE&G is now directly accountable to the NRC for its contractors meeting nuclear-safety related QA/QC requirements both at the project site and at the facilities of its component manufacturers and equipment suppliers worldwide.

NRC Inspections
 
a)
                                    
Completed Inspections
 
As previously reported, the NRC conducted a Containment Vessel (CV) welding inspection in early April 2012.  This inspection examined the techniques, materials, and testing methods used to assemble the containment vessel.  The NRC inspection team completed the inspection with no noted violations.
 
On May 11, 2012, the NRC completed a licensee Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) inspection at SMS.  The results of the inspection will be discussed in Section II.B.3.a of this report.
 
During the week of May 14, 2012, the NRC conducted a multi-area inspection at the site related to: (1) the reporting of parts and material defects; (2) management of ITAACs, (3) quality assurance, and (4) NI civil work.  The inspection resulted in one green finding with an associated notice of violation related to QA/QC records that had missing pages.  The documents and related procedure have been corrected and the incident was entered into the corrective action program for resolution.
 
Former NRC Chairman Gregory B. Jaczko met with VCSN Units 1, 2, & 3 management and toured the construction site on May 22, 2012.  Chairman Jaczko held a teleconference for a small group of media at the conclusion of his visit.
 
On May 24, 2012, the NRC conducted a public meeting/open house regarding the NRC's annual assessment of VCSN Unit 1 and the NRC's oversight of Units 2 and 3 construction.  The NRC gave a presentation on the construction reactor oversight process and responded to questions from the public.
 
b)
                                    
Upcoming Inspections
 
NRC inspections related to implementation of the site QA/QC program and corrective action program are planned to be conducted later this year.  Additional NRC inspections are expected to be conducted during the
remainder of the year.  The NRC also maintains on-site inspectors that perform inspection duties that are summarized in quarterly inspection reports.  SCE&G will receive its first quarterly inspection report within the next few weeks.
 
2.
                                     
NRC Response to the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami of March 2011
 
The COLs for Units 2 & 3 contained a license condition requiring SCE&G to address Beyond-Design-Basis Event Mitigation Recommendation 4.2 of the NRC's Near Term Task Force (NTTF) prior to fuel load and operation of the new plants.
 
In response, SCE&G is involved in a collaborative endeavor by the nuclear industry to develop and implement site-specific, diverse and flexible mitigation strategies to reduce the risks associated with beyond-design-basis conditions.  This approach, which is being led by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), is referred to within the industry as "FLEX".  SCE&G is aligning its efforts with the emerging FLEX guidance as developed by NEI and the NRC to maximize the effectiveness of SCE&G's response to the lessons learned from the Fukushima event and to control costs.
 
In March of 2012, the NRC issued Order No. EA-12-063 requiring SCE&G to modify spent fuel instrumentation to address Recommendation 7.1 of the NTTF.  SCE&G is working through the AP1000 Owners Group (APOG) in a coordinated effort to respond to requirements of this order in a uniform and cost effective manner.
 
On April 13, 2012, the NRC issued a Request for Information (RFI) to SCE&G requiring a descriptive plan indicating how Units 2 & 3 will supply power to communications systems required by the site emergency plan and information about staffing levels necessary to execute that plan during an emergency event involving multiple units.  SCE&G's letter in response to the RFI, dated June 7, 2012, included a schedule of dates identifying September-October 2015 as the time frame when the required Units 2 and 3 staffing and communications assessments would be conducted and when the resulting reports would be supplied to the NRC.
 
SCE&G continues its efforts to address the NTTF recommendations as detailed in its associated COLs license condition, NRC Order EA-12-063, and the RFI issued in April.

Major Construction Permits
 
a)
                                    
Generally
 
Most major construction permits, including the NRC COL, the Clean Water Act Section 404 wetlands permit, the Section 401 Clean Water Act certification and the FERC withdrawal and construction permits have been issued.
 
b)
                                    
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit
 
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) conducted a hearing on June 19, 2012 to allow the public to formally document their questions and concerns related to the draft NPDES permit that SCE&G submitted in February.  This permit is required for construction of the Raw Water System (RWS) intake structure, the Wastewater System (WWS) and other facilities associated with the water and wastewater systems.  This permit will also authorize future discharges from the WWS and of blow down water from the Cooling Towers.  As a result of public comments, SCDHEC requested that a new 7Q10 value be used to determine temperature and chemical effects in the Broad River.  This new evaluation will be provided to SCDHEC in August.  The permit is anticipated to be issued in September of this year.
 
c)
                                     
Other Major Construction-Related Permits
 
No other major construction-related permits are outstanding.  Other construction-related permits are anticipated to be obtained in the ordinary course of administering the project.

BLRA Regulatory Proceedings
 
On May 15, 2012, SCE&G made an Update Filing with the Commission which included revised project construction schedules and cash flow schedules.  Those revisions reflected a) revised substantial completion dates for the Units, b) the resolution of the WEC/Shaw Claims, c) revised Owners costs forecasts, d) revised Transmission costs forecasts, and e) other change orders associated with cyber security, health care costs and other matters.
 
A hearing on the Update Filing is currently scheduled to begin for September 2012.  Under S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E), the Update Filing is to be approved unless the schedule and cost updates are shown to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  By statute, the Commission is required to issue an order approving or denying the petition by November 15, 2012.

Engineering Completion Status
 
As of June 30, 2012, the VCSN Units 2 & 3 Total Plant Design Completion Status is as follows:
 
a)
                                    
Site-specific design  87.9% complete.
 
b)
                                    
Standard Plant Issued for Construction (IFC) Drawings  44.7% complete.
 
Standard Plant IFC Documents are drawings, specifications, and other materials that include the information necessary for constructing the structures, systems and components comprising a standard AP1000 reactor Site Specific Design includes site design and development activities that are not part of the standard plant design of an AP1000 reactor, such as Circulating Water System, Storm Drain System, Potable Water System, Raw Water System, Sanitary Drainage System, Waste Water System and the Yard Fire System, portions of the Electrical Grounding and Lightning Protection System and the Electrical Site Power Distribution System, access roads, and support facilities. Standard plan designs drawings necessary to support equipment procurement and construction planning were completed in past periods.

Site Specific Design Activities
 
Site specific design work is ongoing in support of site specific systems, to include the Circulating Water System (CWS), Yard Fire System (YFS), Potable Water System, RWS, Sanitary Drain System, Offsite Water System (OWS) and WWS.
As reported earlier this year, environmental testing to support OWS design efforts revealed out-of-specification levels of disinfectant byproducts that were determined to be caused by the presence of bromides in the Broad River.  The project team is evaluating changing the design of the OWS to meet these conditions.
 
In addition, phosphate discharges into the Parr Reservoir were limited by SCDHEC due to the elevated level of phosphates otherwise occurring in the Broad River.  These limits on phosphate discharges will require additional evaluation of plant discharges, and ultimately may result in design changes to waste water treatment processes planned for the Units.

Procurement/Fabrication
 
a)
                                    
The delays related to fabrication and delivery of the modules by SMS at its facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana continue to be an important area of focus for the project.  However, floor and wall submodules for Unit 2 module CA20 are being received on site and are being fitted up for welding in the Module Assembly Building (MAB).
 
In early July 2012, subsequent to this reporting period, WEC/Shaw presented SCE&G with a modules delivery and assembly schedule and plans to mitigate further schedule impact due to fabrication delays previously experienced with SMS.  Senior management from both SCE&G and WEC/Shaw continue to actively monitor progress in this area.  WEC personnel continue to provide on-site engineering support for production at SMS.  In addition, SCE&G has placed a permanent, resident inspector at the SMS facility to provide additional oversight, reporting and support.
 
The NRC completed a licensee ITAAC inspection at SMS on May 11, 2012. The NRC debriefed one Unresolved Items (URI) for Design Control Document (DCD) discrepancies related to module Nelson stud spacing and a few minor performance deficiencies. The URI is under review by the NRC.  The minor performance deficiencies will not be documented in the NRC inspection report.
 
b)
                                    
The Unit 2 Core Make-Up Tanks, Pressurizer, Accumulators, and Passive Residual Heat Removal (PRHR) Exchanger are under active manufacture at Mangiarotti (MN) facilities in Italy.  This work was initially delayed due to QA/QC issues and work scheduling issues at MN suppliers but is now proceeding.  The manufacture of Core Make-Up tanks has been delayed due to a change in the design and now shows a delay of 16 months on the milestone for completion of hydrostatic testing.  This delay is not anticipated to affect the construction schedule since the shipment dates for the Core Make-Up tanks are well in advance of the requirements of the construction schedule.  Additional WEC project personnel have been assigned to the facility to provide quality and schedule oversight in an effort to minimize schedule delays.

Construction
 
1.
                                     
The Switchyard remains on schedule to be energized in the first half of 2013, which fully supports the project schedule.  All structures are now complete.  Most breakers and major equipment have now been installed.  Pike is working on control cable installation and relay testing.  When this work is finished, the Switchyard will be complete.
 
2.
                                     
Upon receipt of the COLs, safety-related dental concrete placement began in the Unit 2 NI in April 2012.  Work on the mud-mat and vapor barrier is currently at 80% completion.
 
3.
                                     
Excavation for the Unit 3 NI and Turbine Building was completed in July 2012, subsequent to this reporting period.  Final blasting of and removal of rock in certain areas was also being completed in July of 2012.  Geological mapping for this area is progressing well.
4.
                                     
Since assembly of the Heavy Lift Derrick (HLD) and successful completion of load testing, the HLD has been used in off-loading components and placing them into storage on the project site.
 
5.
                                     
The onsite fabrication of the CV by CB&I is progressing well.  The CV Bottom Head has been turned over to Shaw to attach sections of rebar prior to lifting and placing it in the Unit 2 NI.
 
6.
                                     
Issues related to cracking of welds after post-weld heat treatment were identified by the NRC at the Vogtle site and were resolved.  Process modifications were implemented to prevent similar occurrences at SCE&G's site.    Subsequent to the close of the reporting period, fit-up work was completed on the first of the rings (Ring 1) that attach to the bottom head and will form the vertical walls of the CV when installed.  Welding of the rings has begun.
7.
                                     
Work on the Cooling Towers has progressed during the second quarter of 2012 with setting of CWS supply and return pipes in the areas of Cooling Tower 2A, 3A, and 3B and concrete wall placements and CWS duct bank installations for Cooling Towers 3A and 3B.  With receipt of the USACE Section 404 permit in March 2012, work in the area of Cooling Tower 2B has proceeded with installation of erosion controls followed by grading.  Grading work has progressed on schedule.
 
8.
                                     
When complete, the bottom head will rest on a steel base formed by the CR-10 Module which will be lifted into place later in the construction process.  Assembly of the CR-10 Module for Unit 2 is 100 percent complete.
 
9.
                                     
WEC/Shaw began assembling the framework of steel reinforcing bar (rebar) for the base-mat of the NI using a technique for terminating the floor rebar at the wall connection using "T" joints.  In inspecting similar work at the Vogtle site, NRC inspectors took the position that the technique being used was not the technique envisioned by the relevant drawings in the DCD and was not in compliance with those drawings.  In response, SCE&G entered this issue into the corrective action program.  WEC/Shaw has disassembled the work done using the earlier technique and is proceeding with construction using the alternative approach shown in the drawings.  This is an area of focus for the schedule and Shaw is assessing the schedule impact.

Training
 
1.
                                     
As of June 30, 2012, both the Unit 2 and Unit 3 limited scope simulators (LSS) have been installed and turned over to the Units 2 and 3 training team.  This group is testing the simulators by validating scenarios on them in anticipation of conducting training this Fall.  The simulator control rooms replicate the AP1000 control rooms as currently designed.
2.
                                     
Meetings have been held between WEC, SCE&G and Southern Nuclear Company (SNC) at WEC to develop a recovery plan schedule for the Human Factors Engineering/Integrated System Validation (HFE/ISV) testing which support delivery of the Plant Reference Simulators (PRSs). The schedules for implementation of this testing on the PRSs and the subsequent NRC inspection of the PRSs now support the training plan for reactor operators.  Sufficient reactor operators must be trained and licensed by the NRC before Unit 2 fuel load can take place.  The validation and testing of the PRSs will remain an area of continued focus for the project given the importance to the project of meeting the reactor operator training schedule.
3.
                                     
A National Academy for Nuclear Training Accreditation Team evaluated the Units' Operations training programs during the week of June 25, 2012. There were no findings identified. The National Nuclear Academy accrediting board is scheduled for October 18, 2012 in Atlanta.
 
4.
                                     
Through a collaborative effort between SCE&G, SNC and the NRC, a group has been formed that will assess licensed operator examination standards for AP1000 plants. As part of this effort, mock NRC simulator exams will be conducted at Vogtle 3 and 4 the week of August 20, 2012 using SCE&G and SNC instructors.  This effort will utilize instructors from VCSN and Vogtle to test examination standards and processes to allow NRC to better support the future NRC licensing examinations.
 
5.
                                     
As construction activity ramps up, recruiting and retaining skilled workers for the construction site and preparing the units for operations are a focus area for the project.  WEC/Shaw continues to form alliances and teaming agreements with local tech/trade schools to establish training programs that will ensure craft laborers have the necessary skill sets.  In an effort to attract local employees, SCE&G has worked with Midlands Technical College to develop a "Nuclear Uniform Curriculum Program" for the development of non-licensed operators.  In addition, SCE&G continues to work with other technical colleges such as Orangeburg Tech and Aiken Tech for specialty areas such as Instruments and Controls personnel and Health Physics technicians.  Many personnel have already been hired from these programs and they will continue to serve as a valuable pipeline of local talent for the operations phase of the new Units.

3.
                                     
Escalation Rate Changes
 In addition, the March 2012 settlement agreement fixes the escalation rate on the Fixed with Indexed Adjustment Category going forward for the life of the project.  This change applies to
 
approximately $1.0 billion in costs under the EPC Contact which will now be escalated at the same fixed rates that apply to the existing Firm with Adjustment A cost category.  These amounts were previously escalated based on the Handy-Whitman Indices.  The Handy-Whitman Indices will continue to be used in adjusting non-firm cost categories including a) the Target cost categories, Actual Craft Wages, and Non-Labor Costs, and b) the Time & Materials cost category.
