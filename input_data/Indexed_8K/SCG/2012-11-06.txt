Exhibit 99.1
SCANA Reports Financial Results for Third Quarter 2012
Cayce, S.C., November 6, 2012...
SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced earnings for the third quarter of 2012 of $122 million, or 93 cents basic earnings per share, compared to earnings of $105 million, or 81 cents basic earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2011. During the third quarter, increases in electric and gas margins principally from base rate increases were partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expenses, and share dilution.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, SCANA reported earnings of $315 million, or $2.41 basic earnings per share, compared to earnings of $289 million, or $2.25 basic earnings per share, for the same period in 2011.
We are pleased with the results for the third quarter of 2012, said Jimmy Addison, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Margins were higher than last year due to customer growth and base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. We are tightening our earnings guidance for the year to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.25 basic earnings per share and maintaining our internal target of $3.17 per share.
FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company
Earnings in the third quarter of 2012 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, were $132 million, or $1.01 basic earnings per share compared to earnings of $120 million, or 92 cents basic earnings per share, in 2011. The increase in earnings was due to higher margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Rate Stabilization Act, along with lower operating and maintenance expenses. These increases were partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expense and share dilution. At September 30, 2012, SCE&G was serving approximately 669,000 electric customers and approximately 317,000 natural gas customers, up 0.6 and 1.5 percent, respectively, over 2011.
PSNC Energy
For the third quarter of 2012, PSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported a seasonal loss of $4 million, or 3 cents per share compared to a loss of $5 million, or 3 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2011. Increases in margin due to customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. At September 30,
2012, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 485,000 customers, an increase of 2.0 percent over the previous year.
SCANA Energy - Georgia
SCANA Energy, the Company's retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $5 million, or 3 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2012 compared to a loss of $4 million, or 3 cents per share, in the third quarter of the prior year. At September 30, 2012, SCANA Energy was serving approximately 440,000 customers.
Corporate and Other, Net
SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission (CGT), SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported a loss of $2 million, or 2 cents per share, in the current quarter, compared to a loss of $6 million, or 5 cents per share in the third quarter of 2011. The results for 2011 reflect a slightly higher quarterly effective income tax rate at the holding company, while 2012's results also reflect revenue growth at CGT.
EARNINGS OUTLOOK
The Company tightened its guidance for 2012 basic earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.25. These estimates assume the sale of the shares under the 2010 equity forward in the first quarter of 2013. Other factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement.
