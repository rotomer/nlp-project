Introduction and Summary
 
A.
                                   
Introduction
 
This quarterly report is submitted by South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G or the Company) to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (the Commission) and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS).  It is submitted in satisfaction of the requirements of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-277 (Supp. 2011) and the terms of Commission Order No. 2009-104(A).  This report provides updated information concerning the status of the construction of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) Units 2 & 3 (the Units) and updates the capital cost and construction schedules for the Units.  The Commission approved updated construction schedules for the Units in Order No. 2010-12.  The Commission approved updated capital cost schedules for the Units in Order No. 2011-345 issued on May 16, 2011.

Construction Schedule and Milestones
 
As the report indicates, the Company has met all current construction milestones approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, as adjusted pursuant to contingencies authorized in Order No. 2009-104(A).  There are 146 separate milestones.  As of September 30, 2012, 79 have been completed.  Comparing the scheduled milestone completion dates as of the date of this report to the milestone completion dates approved by the Commission in Order No. 2010-12, the completion dates of 62 milestones have changed.  Of these, 20 have been accelerated and 42 have been delayed for between one and 17 months.

Construction Costs and Cost Forecasts
 
Spending through December 31, 2012 in current dollars is forecasted to be approximately $412 million below the capital cost schedule approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The present cash flow forecast indicates that the Company will be able to complete the Units for $4.553 billion in 2007 dollars, which is $283 million above the forecast approved in Order No. 2011-345.  The current cost estimates include a) new forecasts of Owners Cost associated with the construction oversight and operational readiness functions of the New Nuclear Deployment (NND) team, b) costs associated with the resolution of claims made by the contractors for the Units, Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC and the Shaw Group (WEC/Shaw), related to design changes and delays in the issuance of the Combined Operating Licenses (COLs) for the Units (WEC/Shaw Claims), c) new forecasts of Transmission cost, and d) change orders under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement (EPC Contract) related to cyber security, health insurance costs, and other matters.  The specific items resulting in these increases are discussed in more detail in Section II.
 
On May 15, 2012, the Company filed a petition with the Commission under the authority of S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E) (Update Filing) for review and approval of revised construction and cash flow schedules for the project.  This Update Filing is discussed in more detail in Section II.
 
In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission recognized that forecasts of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) expense and escalation would
vary over the course of the project and required those forecasts to be updated with each quarterly report.  The current escalation indices were issued in November of 2012 for the period of January through June of 2012 and have been used in forecasting the construction costs for the project that are presented here.
 
Chart A
below compares the current capital cost forecast to the forecast presented in the last quarterly report.  This chart shows a reduction in Gross Construction Costs of $63.6 million over the life of the project.  This reduction is due in part to lower escalation rates.  With each quarterly update, a quarter that had been subject to the five-year rate becomes subject to the one-year rate. The figures reported on also include the effect of calculating escalation on an updated cost flow projection for the project.
Chart A
 
 
 
Chart B
compares the current forecast of gross construction costs, including current escalation, to the forecast on which the Commission relied in adopting Order No. 2011-345.  Chart B shows that the forecasted capital cost of the Units in 2007 dollars has increased by approximately $283 million.  This increase reflects the additions to the budget referenced in Section I. D above and is explained in more detail in Section II of this report.  It is offset by the voluntary decision by the Company, communicated to the Commission by letter dated April 25, 2011, that it would not seek recovery for $103,000 in Community Support/Outreach costs that WEC/Shaw had included in costs to be charged under the EPC Contract for the Units. Due to the changes in forecasted escalation, when netted against changes in AFUDC, see Section I. F, below, the cost of the plant in future dollars has decreased by approximately $87 million since Order No. 2011-345 was issued.
 
 
Chart C
below shows the current forecasts of the cost of the Units compared to the cost forecasts underlying the initial Base Load Review Act (BLRA) order, which was issued by the Commission in 2009, and the updated orders issued in 2010 and 2011.  The decline in capital cost forecasts in 2007 dollars between Order No. 2010-12 and 2011-345 reflects the removal of Owner's contingency amounts from the forecasts as required by the opinion of the Supreme Court of South Carolina in , 388 S.C. 486, 697 S.E.2d 587 (2010).  This chart shows that while the cost of the project in 2007 dollars has increased by $18 million since the initial forecasts, the cost of the project in future dollars is approximately $613 million below the initial forecast.

Escalation Rates
 
As provided in Order No. 2009-104(A), the most current one-year inflation indices are used to escalate costs occurring in the twelve-month period after the date of each quarterly report.  The most current escalation indices are found in the Handy-Whitman July 2012 update which was issued in November 2012 and reports data for the period January through June of 2012.  Those rates are reflected in this report.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates.  The forecasted costs provided here reflect the terms of the agreement related to the WEC/Shaw Claims which changes the index applicable to Firm with Indexed Adjustment cost categories going forward from a floating Handy-Whitman adjustment to a fixed rate for the life of the project.
As shown on , utility construction cost escalation rates were at historically high levels during the period 2005-2008, and since then have dropped.  Current escalation rates are shown below on .  When compared to the previous Handy-Whitman release, the current update shows a downward trend in rates.

AFUDC
 
The AFUDC for the project is currently projected to be approximately $38.9 million lower than the forecast on which Order No. 2011-345 was based.  Consistent with Order No. 2009-104(A), SCE&G computes AFUDC based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved methodology as applied to the balance of Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) that is outstanding between rate adjustments.  SCE&G's projected AFUDC rate is currently 5.28% versus a rate of 5.87% that applied when Order No. 2011-345 was issued.

Compliance with the Commission Approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow Target
 
The current approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target for the project was adopted by the Commission in Order No. 2011-345.  In Order No. 2009-104(A), the Commission provided that the applicable Cumulative Project Cash Flow target would be adjusted with each quarterly report to reflect updated escalation data.
Appendix 2
provides the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target updated for current escalation data.  The cash flow targets up until June 2012 have been updated to reflect actual escalation rates.  The cash flow targets for the third quarter of 2012 and beyond have been updated based on the most recently available inflation indices, which for purposes of this report, are the indices provided in November of 2012 that report data for the period January through June 2012.  When final actual indices for the remainder of 2012 become available, the cash flow data for 2012 will be revised to reflect the actual escalation rates.
 
Appendix 2
compares the approved Cumulative Project Cash Flow target to the current cumulative cash flow schedules for the project, which include actual costs where available and SCE&G's working forecasts of annual cash flows for future years.  In addition, the project cash flow targets presented on for 2011 and 2012 have been adjusted to reflect timing differences between the billing methodology under the EPC Contract and the calculation of the escalated cash flow targets under Order No. 2009-104(A).  Under the EPC Contract, for periods where actual escalation rates are not available, WEC/Shaw bills SCE&G based on a rolling 2-year average of the applicable Handy-Whitman rate and provides adjustments to reflect the actual rate when it is known.  An adjustment has been made to target calculationsto offset the timing differences that arise as a result of WEC/Shaw's approach to estimated billings and credits.  This adjustment applies to those EPC Contract cost categories that are subject to indexed escalation.

Progress of Construction of the Units
 
Since issuance by SCE&G of a Full Notice to Proceed (FNTP) to WEC/Shaw on April 19, 2012, work has been progressing at the project site.  During the third quarter of 2012, WEC/Shaw placed over 18,000 cubic yards of concrete for the Nuclear Island (NI) and turbine building of Unit 2. Since placement of this concrete began in April of 2012, a total of 36,000 cubic yards have been placed in this location.
 
Overall, the fabrication of equipment off-site is proceeding satisfactorily on a schedule that supports the on-site construction schedule.  The components of the Condenser for Unit 2 have arrived onsite and are being assembled.  Manufacturing and testing of the Reactor Vessel for Unit 2 is nearing completion and shipment is planned for the first quarter of 2013.  However, the schedule for fabrication of sub-modules from the Shaw Modular Solutions (SMS) facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana remains a focus area for the project. This sub-module fabrication work continues to be delayed due to previously identified module redesign and quality issues.  Progress has been made with production issues, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) issues.  SMS continues to work on its production schedule to mitigate past delays.  SCE&G continues
 
 
to monitor and oversee this area carefully and is devoting resources and attention to this area.  This is discussed further in Section II.C.1.
 
As previously reported, on July 30, 2012, Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the Shaw Group which it plans to operate as a business sector under the name CB&I Shaw.  The acquisition is not anticipated to affect the project in any material way.
 
The agreement resolving the claims associated with the delayed issuance of the COLs, design changes to the Shield Building, design changes to the structural modules, and the lower than anticipated rock elevations encountered in certain areas where the Unit 2 NI will be constructed was finalized on July 11, 2012, and reflects new Substantial Completion Dates for Units 2 and 3 of March 2017 and May 2018, respectively.  This agreement will be incorporated in Change Order No. 16 which is being prepared for execution.
 
At present all BLRA milestone completion dates are within approved schedule contingencies.  Based on BLRA milestone updates received from WEC/Shaw as of the close of this reporting period, two milestones have been delayed by 17 months:  Milestone No. 61, Core Make-Up Tank Hydro Test; and, Milestone No. 92, Start Containment Large Bore Pipe Supports for Unit 2.  However, neither of these milestone delays will affect the construction-need date of the activities in question.  The updated completion dates for all milestones are listed in Appendix 1.
 
A more detailed presentation of the status of the project is addressed in Section II.A-Section II.G below.

Licensing and Permitting
 
As licensee for the Units, SCE&G is now directly accountable to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for its contractors meeting nuclear-safety related QA/QC requirements both at the project site and at the facilities of its component manufacturers and equipment suppliers worldwide. The Consortium through the EPC Contract is also responsible to SCE&G for making sure that these requirements are met.

NRC Response to the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami of March 2011
 
In an industry-wide effort to address requirements associated with Fukushima related orders, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) developed guidance for licensees to use in near-term and long-term planning for compliance which has been endorsed by the NRC.  SCE&G used that NRC-endorsed guidance to develop strategies for compliance with a license condition 2.D(13), which relates to restoring core cooling after a beyond design basis accident.  In addition, SCE&G has used that guidance to develop strategies for complying with Order EA-12-063, which requires SCE&G to address several characteristics of the Units' spent fuel pool instrumentation to assure that water levels are identifiable during a beyond design basis event.
 
In response to license condition 2.D(13), SCE&G issued its initial status report to the NRC on October 22, 2012, subsequent to this reporting period.  In its status report, SCE&G summarized those actions both taken and planned in an effort to comply with the license condition.
 
In response to NRC Order EA-12-063, SCE&G issued its initial status report to the NRC on October 29, 2012, related to spent fuel pool instrumentation.  SCE&G provided the NRC with a technical report addressing all requirements of the Order, allowing SCE&G to request that the Order be closed out since the conditions had been met.
As previously reported, SCE&G responded to the NRC concerning the NRC's Request for Information (RFI) dated April 13, 2012 by letter on June 7, 2012 addressing emergency power supply for site communications equipment and the staffing necessary to execute the emergency plan in the event of a multi-unit event that resulted in an extended loss of all AC power.  The NRC has not requested any additional information.

Major Construction Permits
 
a)
                                    
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit
 
The NPDES permit, required for construction of the Raw Water System (RWS) intake structure, the Wastewater System (WWS) and other facilities associated with the water and wastewater systems, was issued by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) on October 11, 2012, subsequent to this reporting period.  This permit also authorizes future discharges from the WWS and of blow down water from the Cooling Towers.  One concerned citizen has appealed.  The NPDES permit must await resolution of the appeal.
 
b)
                                    
Other Major Construction-Related Permits
 
No other major construction-related permits are outstanding.  Other construction-related permits are anticipated to be obtained in the ordinary course of administering the project.

BLRA Regulatory Proceedings
 
As previously reported, on May 15, 2012, SCE&G submitted an Update Filing with the Commission which included revised project construction schedules and cash flow schedules.  Those revisions reflected a) revised substantial completion dates for the Units, b) the resolution of the WEC/Shaw Claims, c) revised Owners costs forecasts, d) revised Transmission costs forecasts, and e) other change orders associated with cyber security, health care costs and other matters.  The revised construction schedules requested in this docket reflect the new substantial completion dates of March 2017 and May 2018 for Units 2 and 3 respectively and a resetting of certain BLRA milestones.  A hearing on the Update Filing was held on October 2-3, 2012.  Under S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(E), the Update Filing is to be approved unless the schedule and cost updates are shown to be the result of imprudence by the utility.  By statute, the Commission is required to issue an order approving or denying the petition by November 15, 2012.
The Commission voted on this matter on November 7, 2012 and issued a directive approving the revised project construction milestone schedules and cash flow schedules. The only exception was that the Commission determined that the costs associated with Phase II of the change order addressing cyber security upgrades to the Units, in the amount of $4.95 million, were premature since the precise scope of Phase II work will be determined by the evaluation and work plan created in Phase I.  The Commission did not suggest that these costs could not be recovered but indicated that the Company may seek to include them within its approved capital costs schedules when they are more fully known.

Engineering Completion Status
 
As of September 30, 2012, the VCSN Units 2 & 3 Total Plant Design Completion Status is as follows:
 
a)
                                    
Site-specific design  90.3% complete.
b)
                                    
Standard Plant Issued for Construction (IFC) Drawings  67.8% complete.
 
2.
                                     
Site Specific Design Activities
 
Site specific design work is ongoing in support of site specific systems, to include the Circulating Water System (CWS), Yard Fire System (YFS), Potable Water System, RWS, Sanitary Drain System, Offsite Water System (OWS) and WWS.
 
As discussed in previous reports, environmental testing to support OWS design efforts revealed out-of-specification levels of disinfectant byproducts that were determined to be caused by the presence of bromides in the Broad River.  As a result of these findings, the project team determined that redesign of the OWS using reverse osmosis is necessary to achieve SCDHEC potable water requirements.  Reverse osmosis is a process by which a semi-permeable membrane is utilized to filter out any unwanted substances in water supplies.  Efforts are ongoing to define the work scope and additional costs associated with this issue.
As previously reported, phosphate discharges into the Parr Reservoir were limited by SCDHEC due to the elevated level of phosphates otherwise occurring in the Broad River and this would cause SCE&G to have to make changes in treatment plans. It has now been determined that SCE&G will meet the current environmental discharge limits, so this issue will not affect current treatment plans.

Procurement/Fabrication
 
1.
                                     
The delays related to fabrication and delivery of the sub-modules by SMS at its facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana continue to be an important area of focus for the project.  However, floor and wall sub-modules for Unit 2 module CA20 continue to be received on site and fitted up for welding in the Module Assembly Building (MAB).  In early July 2012, WEC/Shaw presented SCE&G with a module delivery and assembly schedule and plans to mitigate further schedule impact due to fabrication delays previously experienced with SMS.
 
On May 11, 2012, the NRC completed a licensee Inspections, Tests, Analyses and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) inspection at SMS. A URI for Design Control Document (DCD) discrepancies related to module Nelson stud spacing and a few minor performance deficiencies were debriefed. During the NRC 2012 Third Quarter Exit conducted on October 9, 2012, which occurred subsequent to this reporting period, the NRC substituted for the previous URI a potential Green, NRC-identified violation.  A "Green" finding is an NRC-identified finding of very low safety significance.
 
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2012, WEC identified an issue related to a welding process option used during fabrication on several sub-modules that does not meet the "full penetration" weld configuration specified in the Current Licensing Basis for the AP1000 reactor.  The previously fabricated CA20 sub-modules will require repair that likely will occur on the project site or at qualified facilities other than the SMS facility to allow module fabrication to continue there with no further delays.  Efforts are also ongoing by the Consortium to mitigate further licensing configuration deviations by ensuring compliance with the current licensing basis on future module fabrication.
 
Senior management from both SCE&G and WEC/Shaw continue to actively monitor progress in this area.  WEC personnel continue to provide on-site engineering support for production at SMS.  As previously reported, SCE&G placed a permanent resident inspector at the SMS facility who continues to provide additional oversight, reporting and support.
 
2.
                                     
The Unit 2 Core Make-Up Tanks, Pressurizer, Accumulators, and Passive Residual Heat Removal (PRHR) Heat Exchanger are under active manufacture
at Mangiarotti (MN) facilities in Italy.  This work was initially delayed due to QA/QC issues and work scheduling issues at MN suppliers but is now proceeding.  The manufacture of the Unit 2 Core Make-Up Tanks at MN facilities in Italy has been delayed due to a change in the design.  As of September 30, 2012, this milestone shows a delay of 17 months for completion of hydrostatic testing in.  This delay is not anticipated to affect the construction schedule since the shipment dates for the Core Make-Up Tanks are well in advance of the requirements of the construction schedule.  Additional WEC project personnel have been assigned to the facility to provide quality and schedule oversight in an effort to minimize schedule delays.

Construction
 
1.
                                     
Control cable installation and relay testing by Pike continues to progress.   The Switchyard remains on schedule to be energized in the first half of 2013, which fully supports the project schedule.
 
2.
                                     
Safety-related concrete placement through the upper mudmat in the Unit 2 NI was completed in August 2012.  Completion of work on the Unit 2 NI and Turbine Building horizontal waterproof membranes (the vapor barrier under each basemat) will now allow vertical work to begin.  A portion of basemat rebar assembly was completed and placed on top of the NI mudmat.  Assembly of rebar for the Shield Building and other areas has commenced.
 
3.
                                     
As reported in the last quarter, WEC/Shaw had begun assembling the framework of steel reinforcing bar (rebar) for the basemat of the NI using a technique for terminating the floor rebar at the wall connection using "T" joints.
In inspecting similar work at the Vogtle site, NRC inspectors took the position that the technique being used was not the technique envisioned by the relevant drawings in the DCD and was not in compliance with those drawings.  The NRC also raised an issue concerning rebar fabrication.  In response, SCE&G entered these issues into the CAP.  WEC/Shaw disassembled the work done using the earlier techniques and has proceeded with construction using the alternative approach shown in the drawings. Since the last report, the project has also experienced issues with acceptability of steel components intended for use in the steel framework of the basemat. These components have been identified and replaced.  Subsequent to this reporting period, the NRC raised questions relative to the rebar design for the NI elevator pit and NI sumps. WEC is in the process of addressing the NRC questions. The initial pouring of the basemat concrete has been delayed pending the resolution of the NRC questions related to this rebar design. SCE&G continues to monitor Shaw's compliance with the DCD in performing this work.

During the third quarter of 2012, the Heavy Lift Derrick (HLD) made its second lift of a rebar preassembly weighing approximately 465 tons, which was placed onto the NI mudmat, and continues to prove useful in off-loading components and placing them into storage on the project site.
 
5.
                                     
The onsite fabrication of the Containment Vessel (CV) by CB&I is steadily progressing.  Fit-up work on the rings that attach to the bottom head and will form the vertical walls of the CV continues.  Shaw has installed the majority of the exterior circumferential rebar for the CV Bottom Head.  Exterior vertical rebar and interior rebar installation is ongoing.
 
6.
                                     
Work on the Cooling Towers has progressed during the third quarter of 2012.  Setting of CWS supply and return pipes in Cooling Tower 2A was completed.  Erection of Cooling Tower 2A precast walls began.  Concrete basin wall placements were completed for Cooling Towers 3A and 3B.  Setting of CWS supply and return pipes for Cooling Towers 3A and 3B continued.  Grading work which required the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit in the area of Cooling Tower 2B is progressing.
 
7.
                                     
It was previously reported that assembly of the CR-10 Module for Unit 2 in which the bottom head will be set was completed.  However, some rework was required due to design changes to improve the lap splice locations for rebar.  Shaw has now begun to place rebar on the CR-10 structure.
 
8.
                                     
As previously reported, excavation for the Unit 3 NI and Turbine Building was completed in July 2012.  Final blasting and removal of rock has been completed.  Geological mapping for
this area was 70% complete as of the end of September.  A recent NRC inspection of the Unit 3 excavation geological features and mapping program yielded positive results, with no findings or violations.

Training
 
1.
                                     
Collaborative efforts between WEC, SCE&G, and Southern Nuclear Company (SNC) have resulted in a recovery plan schedule for implementation of Human Factors Engineering/Integrated System Validation (HFE/ISV) testing for the Plant Reference Simulator (PRS).  The schedules for implementation of the PRS and the subsequent NRC inspection of the PRS now support the NRC licensing of operators to support fuel load.  Continuous monitoring and routine status updates are ongoing to ensure that the required number of reactor operators are trained and licensed by the NRC, which will allow Unit 2 fuel load to take place.  The validation and testing of the PRSs will remain an area of continued focus for the project given the importance to the project of meeting the reactor operator training schedule.
 
2.
                                     
The Senior Reactor Operator Certification (SROC) class that began on June 11, 2012 at VCSNS continues using VCSNS Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) certified instructors. The simulator phase of the SROC training conducted using the Limited Scope Simulators (LSS) started in September 2012 and will continue through January 2013. All students have successfully completed the systems portion of the training.
 
3.
                                     
As previously reported, no findings were identified during an evaluation of the Units' Operations training programs conducted during the last week of June by the National Academy for Nuclear Training Accreditation Team.  The Units' six Operations training programs for reactor operators, shift managers and related positions were accredited by the National Academy for Nuclear Training's National Nuclear Accrediting Board on October 18, 2012 at the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) in Atlanta, GA.
 
4.
                                     
Through a collaborative effort between SCE&G, SNC and the NRC, a group was formed that will assess licensed operator examination standards for AP1000 plants. As part of this effort, mock NRC simulator exams were conducted at Vogtle Units 3 & 4 the week of August 20, 2012 using SCE&G and SNC instructors.  The NRC determined that no substantive changes to the examination standards will be required.

Escalation Rate Changes
 The settlement agreement finalized in July 2012 fixes the escalation rate on the Fixed with Indexed Adjustment Category going forward for the life of the project.  This change applies to approximately $1.0 billion in costs under the EPC Contract which will now be escalated at the same fixed rates that apply to the existing Firm with Adjustment A cost category.  These amounts were previously escalated based on the Handy-Whitman Indices.  The Handy-Whitman Indices will continue to be used in adjusting non-firm cost categories including a) the Target cost categories, Actual Craft Wages, and Non-Labor Costs, and b) the Time & Materials cost category.

Schedules of the Capital Costs Incurred Including Updates to the Information Required by S.C. Code Ann.  58-33-270(B) (6) (the Inflation Indices)
 
The Capital Cost section of this report (Section IV.A) provides an update of the cumulative capital costs incurred and forecasted to be incurred in completing the project.  These costs are compared to the cumulative capital cost targets approved by the Commission in Order No. 2011-345.  The approved capital cost targets have been adjusted to reflect the currently reported historical escalation rates.  There has not been any use by the Company of the capital cost timing contingencies that were approved by the Commission in Order No. 2009-104(A).  The Inflation Indices section (Section IV.B) of this report provides updated information on inflation indices and the changes in them.

Appendix 2
also shows the cumulative cash flow for the project based on actual expenditures to date and the Company's current forecast of cost and construction schedule under the heading
"Actual through September 2012 plus Projected."
 
As shown on the actual expenditure for the project during the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $349 million. As shown on line 39, the cumulative amount projected to be spent on the project as of December 31, 2012 is approximately $1.805 billion.  As shown on line 18, the Cumulative Project Cash Flow target approved by the Commission for year-end 2012 adjusted for current escalation and WEC/Shaw billing differences is approximately $2.128 billion.  As a result, the cumulative cash flow at year-end 2012 is forecasted to be approximately $323.1 million less than the target.
