Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media (San Francisco) Glen Mathison (415) 636-5448 Investors/Analysts Rich Fowler (415) 636-9869 SCHWAB ANNOUNCES QUARTERLY RESULTS SAN FRANCISCO, October 21, 2003 - The Charles Schwab Corporation announced today that its net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 was $127 million. In comparison, the Company reported net income of $126 million for the second quarter of 2003 and a net loss of $4 million for the third quarter of 2002. Excluding $23 million in after-tax charges relating to previously announced restructuring efforts and a $3 million after-tax benefit relating to the Company's discontinued European operations, Schwab's third quarter 2003 adjusted operating income was $147 million - up 13% from the $130 million adjusted operating income generated in the prior quarter, and up 48% from the year-ago quarter's $99 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company's net income was $324 million, up 72% compared with the $188 million earned during the same period in 2002. Adjusted operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $340 million, 7% higher than the $319 million adjusted operating income produced during the same period in 2002. A table that reconciles net income to adjusted operating income is attached. In reviewing the third quarter, CEO David S. Pottruck commented, "With economic news remaining generally encouraging, securities market returns were positive for the second straight quarter. These improving conditions are showing up in our clients' portfolios - net market gains for Schwab client assets have totaled nearly $100 billion since the end of February. Third quarter 2003 net new assets of $11 billion showed improvement over the prior quarter, and we ended the third quarter with $877 billion in client assets, up 21% from a year ago. While new account openings were just 124,000 during the third quarter - due at least in part to our relatively low marketing investment in recent months - we do see multiple signs that clients are re-engaging with their financial affairs, including more than $10 billion of net inflows into actively managed equity and balanced mutual funds from April through September, a 21% increase in margin loan balances during that same period, and increased trading activity." "Continued improvement in the market environment during the third quarter of 2003 helped to generate a 3% increase in our revenues over the prior quarter, and every revenue category once again showed sequential improvement," the CEO said. "While restructuring charges kept net income essentially flat between the second and third quarters, our continued expense discipline enabled us to achieve an after-tax profit margin in excess of 12% for a second straight quarter. Our 14% third quarter after-tax operating profit margin - the highest since the second quarter of 2000 - is further evidence that our restructuring efforts helped pave the way for improved financial performance. We also continued to gain ground when comparing current and year-ago quarters - a 3% increase in revenues for the third quarter of 2003 and a 5% decline in operating expenses combined to yield a 48% increase in adjusted operating income." Mr. Pottruck continued, "While the third quarter is traditionally one of the slower quarters of the year, the improving environment led to continued strength in client demand for the market wisdom, information, tools and services they expect from Schwab. For our actively trading clients, we introduced our Profit Taking Strategies online seminar, the fourth in a series designed to help clients measurably improve their trading results. The program covers practical strategies for setting and adhering to price targets, as well as evaluating when to take profits. Additionally, we announced a price reduction for those clients who trade more than 30 times a quarter - commissions were lowered to $14.95, or $0.01 per share for trades over 1,000 shares with a $14.95 minimum. We also entered into a joint effort with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to enable CyberTrader clients to trade E-mini S&P 500(R) and Nasdaq 100 stock index contracts. Schwab representatives conducted another 1,200 local investing workshops and educational events during the third quarter, attracting over 12,000 attendees. We also held another 40 Live Online Web-based interactive workshops. The number of clients using our Schwab Private Client service grew to 12,400 by the end of the third quarter, and their accounts currently hold $13 billion in assets, increases of 20% and 23%, respectively, from month-end June 2003. These clients now have access to the Schwab Personal Portfolio Dividend Equity (TM) account, a managed account that invests primarily in dividend-paying stocks that have been rated A or B by Schwab Equity Ratings (TM). Net new client assets in accounts at Schwab with an ongoing advisory component - including Schwab Private Client, accounts managed by independent investment advisors (IAs), and U.S. Trust accounts - totaled $7 billion during the third quarter of 2003, and total assets in these accounts equaled $388 billion, up 21% from month-end September 2002." "Last quarter was the first full quarter of operations for Schwab Bank, N.A., which continues to gain momentum in serving our clients through a lending program that includes first mortgages and home equity loans and a deposit program that offers CDs and money market deposit accounts," Mr. Pottruck added. "The bank originated $1.1 billion in first mortgages during the quarter and outstanding home equity loans reached $100 million by month-end September. The bank ended the third quarter with total assets of $1.6 billion and client deposits of $1.2 billion. In addition, the bank's loan commitments at quarter-end included $350 million in first mortgages and $450 million in new home equity lines." Mr. Pottruck commented, "Also during the third quarter, our Services for Investment Managers (SIM) group continued its tradition of adding value for the IAs who use Schwab for custody, trading and administrative support by sponsoring a series of 13 Institutional Workshops across the country. These workshops provided over 800 of our IAs' back office staff with training and suggestions for maximizing operating efficiency as part of our overall effort to enable IAs to focus on growing their practices. In addition, The Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving (R) recently introduced Charitable Asset Management, a service which enables IAs working with SIM or U.S. Trust to manage the donated assets in client Charitable Gift Accounts of $500,000 or more in a flexible, personalized manner. Client referrals to IAs through our Schwab Advisor Network (R) program totaled 5,400 during the third quarter of 2003, down slightly from the previous quarter. At month-end September, client assets at Schwab associated with IA referral programs equaled $17 billion, and total client assets under the guidance of IAs were a record $260 billion, up 49% and 23%, respectively, from a year ago." "U.S. Trust's acquisition of State Street's New England-based Private Asset Management Group was recently approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators, and we are continuing to work towards closing this transaction on October 31," Mr. Pottruck said. "Third quarter referrals from Schwab to U.S. Trust totaled approximately 330, compared with just under 360 in the prior quarter and about 270 in the third quarter of 2002. At month-end September 2003, client assets at U.S. Trust associated with this referral program totaled $2.7 billion and total client assets were $116 billion, up 69% and 9%, respectively, from September 2002." Mr. Pottruck continued, "During the third quarter, our Corporate Services team launched a new service for participants in bundled 401(k) plans serviced by Schwab. Participants in these plans now have either online, telephonic, or in-person access to customized advice provided by GuidedChoice, Inc., including specific recommendations about savings rates and the core investment fund choices available in a given retirement plan. Participants will also have the option of automatic account rebalancing. Overall, net new client assets placed in 401(k) accounts at Schwab totaled $561 million during the third quarter of 2003, up 2% from the year ago quarter. Total client assets in employer-sponsored retirement plans at Schwab now total $105 billion, up 24% from the third quarter of 2002." "Our Capital Markets group continued to focus on delivering high quality trade executions for our institutional and individual clients during the third quarter," Mr. Pottruck continued. "We added William McLaughlin and William Van Buren to our institutional equities trading team during the quarter to head up our listed sales function and our new Chicago office, respectively; the team now totals 114. Our clients will also benefit from a new state-of-the-art trading floor that provides our traders with the hardware and trading systems support they need to work as efficiently and effectively as possible." Mr. Pottruck added, "During the third quarter we launched the Schwab Dividend Equity Fund (TM), which offers clients current income and capital appreciation by primarily investing in dividend-paying stocks that have been rated an A or B by Schwab Equity Ratings. This fund, which recognizes the importance of recent changes in dividend taxation, is the fourth member of the SchwabFunds Family (R) that utilizes Schwab Equity Ratings to help guide stock selection. By quarter-end, assets in the Dividend Equity Fund totaled almost $165 million, making this one of our most successful fund launches ever. Overall, client asset balances in mutual funds at Schwab totaled $362 billion at the end of September, including $90 billion in third-party Mutual Fund OneSource (R) funds, $29 billion in our clearing business, $88 billion in other third-party Mutual Fund Marketplace (R) funds, and $155 billion in proprietary funds."
