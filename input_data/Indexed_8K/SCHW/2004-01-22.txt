Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media (San Francisco) Greg Gable (415) 636-5847 Investors/Analysts Rich Fowler (415) 636-9869 SCHWAB ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS SAN FRANCISCO, January 22, 2004 - The Charles Schwab Corporation announced today that its net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 was $148 million. In comparison, the Company reported net income of $127 million for the third quarter of 2003 and a net loss of $79 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Excluding an $11 million after-tax gain on the sale of an investment and a $13 million after-tax charge relating to previously announced restructuring efforts, Schwab's fourth quarter 2003 adjusted operating income was $150 million - - up 2% from the $147 million adjusted operating income generated in the prior quarter, and up 67% from the year-ago quarter's $90 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's net income was $472 million, up 333% compared with the $109 million earned during 2002. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $490 million, 20% higher than the $409 million adjusted operating income produced for the prior year. A table that reconciles net income to adjusted operating income is attached. In reviewing 2003, CEO David S. Pottruck commented, "After a very challenging first quarter, the balance of the year was marked by continued improvement in economic and market conditions, as well as ongoing signs of heightened client engagement. For 2003, our clients experienced over $140 billion in market gains in their portfolios. In addition, new and existing clients brought approximately $44 billion in net new assets to the Company during the year, which, when added to the $12 billion in net new assets associated with our acquisition of State Street's Private Asset Management Group (PAM), helped bring total client assets to $967 billion as of month-end December - - a 26% increase over December 2002. While new account openings of 592,000 for all of 2003 were impacted by our reduction in marketing investment during the middle of the year, increased marketing outlays from September through year-end contributed to a 42% increase in the daily rate of new account openings between August and December. Our clients' net purchases of actively managed equity and balanced mutual funds totaled $16 billion in 2003 versus approximately $3 billion in 2002, and margin loan balances rose by nearly 30% during the year to end 2003 at $8.5 billion. Another important indicator of client engagement is, of course, trading activity, and our client's December 2003 daily average revenue trades of 168,000 were the highest since September 2001. We have seen these increased trading levels persist into early 2004 - daily average revenue trades for the first 12 trading days of January totaled 221,000." "Sustained improvement in the market environment during the fourth quarter of 2003 helped the Company achieve a third consecutive quarter of growth across all revenue categories, even after adjusting for a non-recurring gain on the sale of an investment," Mr. Pottruck said. "As a result, our revenues regained much of the ground lost earlier in the year and totaled $4.1 billion for 2003, essentially flat with 2002. We ended 2003 with headcount totaling 16,300, down 2% from year-end 2002, and the ongoing dedication of our staff to expense discipline, combined with our recently completed restructuring efforts, has yielded substantially improved financial performance. The Company's net income of $148 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 compares to a loss of $79 million for the year-ago period and represents our best performance since the first quarter of 2000. In addition, after starting 2003 with a first quarter so challenging that adjusted operating income fell 43% on a year-over-year basis and our after-tax operating profit margin totaled just 7%, we went on to achieve a 20% increase in full-year adjusted operating income and a 12% margin." Mr. Pottruck continued, "Positioning the Company for improved financial performance was a firm-wide effort. Chuck Schwab and I are particularly proud that our management and staff pulled together to deliver that improved performance in 2003 while relentlessly pursuing our key growth initiatives and building a firm uniquely capable of serving investor needs. For our actively trading clients, we added access to specialized trading consultants during 2003, as well as two new online seminars as part of an ongoing series designed to help them measurably improve their trading results. We also reduced our pricing for certain trades, enhanced our CyberTrader Pro(R) software, and launched CyberTrader Live(TM), which provides an interactive forum designed to strengthen trading skills and help in analyzing live market data. Schwab representatives conducted approximately 4,500 local investing workshops and educational events, attracting almost 43,000 attendees. We also held over 200 Live Online Web-based interactive workshops. For clients who need occasional access to tailored guidance in managing their investments, we enhanced our offering of for-fee advice consultations; we also expanded the investing insight available to clients through a series of online panel discussions that offer expert perspectives on topics ranging from macroeconomic conditions to international investing. The number of clients using our Schwab Private Client(TM) service grew to 14,300 by the end of 2003, and their accounts currently hold $16 billion in assets, increases of 107% and 162%, respectively, from year-end 2002. These clients now have access to two Schwab Personal Portfolio(TM) accounts - Dividend Equity and Core Equity - which combine the features of managed accounts with the stock evaluation power of Schwab Equity Ratings(TM). Net new client assets in accounts at Schwab with an ongoing advisory component - including Schwab Private Client, accounts managed by independent investment advisors (IAs), U.S. Trust accounts, and the effect of the PAM acquisition - totaled $41 billion during 2003, and total assets in these accounts equaled $436 billion at year-end, up 31% from December 2002." "Our Services for Investment Managers (SIM) group sustained its leadership role in serving the needs of IAs during 2003 through a variety of value-added initiatives," Mr. Pottruck commented. "We recently introduced Schwab Advisor Transition Support(TM), a suite of services designed to help advisors deal with succession planning issues. For the IAs working with SIM or U.S. Trust to manage donated assets in client Charitable Gift Accounts of $500,000 or more, The Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving(R) introduced Charitable Asset Management, a program that helps IAs manage those assets in a flexible, personalized manner. Also during 2003, we enhanced our Advisor WebCenter(TM) web site design and maintenance offering to include easier document uploads and online marketing support - a total of 285 IAs have utilized this service since its introduction in 2002. In addition, we held a series of workshops to provide IA back office staff with training and suggestions for improving operating efficiency, and we held a series of regional conferences to share ideas on best practices and strategies for growth. We also recently held our 13th annual IMPACT(R) conference, the largest industry conference of its kind. Almost 1,000 advisors attended the conference, which included over 30 educational sessions providing information on issues IAs face, including investment strategies and tools, practice management, technology, operational and business solutions and recent market trends affecting the advisor industry. Client referrals to IAs through our Schwab Advisor Network(R) program totaled 20,400 during 2003. At month-end December, client assets at Schwab associated with IA referral programs equaled $20 billion, and total client assets associated with SIM were $287 billion, up 59% and 29%, respectively, from a year ago." Mr. Pottruck added, "U.S. Trust, one of the premier wealth management firms in the country, completed its acquisition of PAM by month-end October 2003, bringing us an immediate strong presence in the important New England wealth market. U.S. Trust opened 2 other offices during 2003 and ended the year with 37 offices in its nationwide network. Schwab referred approximately 1,300 potential clients to U.S. Trust in 2003, compared with about 1,400 in 2002. At month-end December 2003, client assets at U.S. Trust associated with this referral program totaled $3.2 billion and total client assets were $137 billion, up 78% and 27%, respectively, from December 2002." "During 2003, our Corporate Services team launched a new service offering either online, telephonic, or in-person access to customized advice provided by GuidedChoice, Inc., for participants in bundled 401(k) plans serviced by Schwab," Mr. Pottruck noted. "We also introduced an online reporting tool to help plan sponsors keep track of how well Schwab is serving their clients, an online tool to help stock plan administrators manage their employee plans more efficiently, a Web-based reporting system that enables public companies to report insider transactions within new federal guidelines, and a series of enhanced services for companies with traditional and cash-balance pension plans and their employees. Overall, net new client assets placed in 401(k) accounts at Schwab totaled $3.8 billion during 2003, up 23% from the prior year. Total client assets in employer-sponsored retirement plans at Schwab now total $114 billion, up 29% from the end of 2002." Mr. Pottruck said, "Our Capital Markets group underwent dramatic change during 2003 as we virtually recreated this organization to serve the needs of both institutional and individual clients more effectively. Early in the year, we revamped our trading floor to incorporate state-of-the-art hardware and trading systems. We also formally introduced the Schwab Liquidity Network(TM), our system for pooling the orders of our individual investor client base with those of hundreds of broker-dealers and institutional investment firms to offer greater opportunities for the best possible price on most stock trades. In addition, we initiated automated electronic execution of virtually all Nasdaq stock trades of up to 20,000 shares for our individual clients, and we expanded the number of securities traded by the Liquidity Network to over 11,000 at year-end, up from about 5,000 in February. We bolstered our institutional equities trading capabilities during the year by building a team of over 170 professionals and also agreeing to acquire SoundView Technology group. While the SoundView deal unfortunately resulted in the consolidation of about 100 positions, our new Schwab SoundView Capital Markets operation offers institutional clients a straightforward, uncomplicated combination of quality fundamental equity research and state of the art trade execution capabilities. While all these changes were occurring on the equities side, client interest in fixed income securities remained strong - at month-end December, client assets in these instruments equaled $146 billion, up 20% from December 2002." Mr. Pottruck added, "We expanded our mutual fund offering through several avenues in 2003. During the fourth quarter, we announced the adoption of AXA Rosenberg LLC's entire U.S. family of 11 mutual funds, which will become known as the Laudus Funds(TM). Also during the fourth quarter, U.S. Trust launched the Excelsior(R) Equity Income Fund, which focuses on stocks that pay above-average dividends. In addition, we launched three proprietary Schwab mutual funds during the year, including the GNMA Fund, Small-Cap Equity Fund and the Dividend Equity Fund. Overall, client asset balances in mutual funds at Schwab totaled $387 billion at the end of December, including $102 billion in third-party Mutual Fund OneSource(R) funds, $34 billion in our clearing business, $98 billion in other third-party Mutual Fund Marketplace(R) funds, and $153 billion in proprietary funds." Mr. Pottruck continued "Schwab Bank, N.A., which began operations last April, performed ahead of our expectations in its first eight months of operations. We originated $1.7 billion in first mortgages for the year and outstanding home equity loans reached $292 million by month-end December. The bank ended the fourth quarter with total assets of $2.7 billion and client deposits of $2.4 billion. In addition, the bank's loan commitments at quarter-end included $211 million in first mortgages and $516 million in unused home equity lines. Also, beginning in the fourth quarter our clients can sweep the excess cash held in their Schwab One(R), IRA or Educational Savings Accounts to a bank money market deposit account. These FDIC-insured accounts enable us to offer competitive money market rates to both clients with smaller asset balances at Schwab and those seeking an alternative to our Schwab One or money market mutual fund offerings." Mr. Pottruck concluded, "The Company begins 2004 with gathering momentum - an improved market environment, continued signs of heightened investor engagement, strengthened financial performance, and a significantly expanded array of products, services and investment insight. Most importantly, however, we also have an experienced team that brings their full energy to bear on delivering the best service experience possible to our clients. We continue to have the competitive position, resources and financial strength necessary to sustain our leadership in financial services, but our people, and their ongoing dedication to the Company's vision and values, remain the critical element in our continued success."
