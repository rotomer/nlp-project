Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media (San Francisco) Glen Mathison (415) 636-5448 Investors/Analysts Rich Fowler (415) 636-9869 SCHWAB ANNOUNCES QUARTERLY RESULTS AND 43% DIVIDEND INCREASE NET INCOME RISES 127% ON 32% REVENUE GROWTH SAN FRANCISCO, April 20, 2004 - The Charles Schwab Corporation announced today that its net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 was $161 million. In comparison, the Company reported net income of $71 million for the first quarter of 2003 and net income of $148 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Three Months Ended --March 31,-- % Financial Highlights 2004 2003 Change - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues (in millions) $1,190 $ 900 32% Net income (in millions) $ 161 $ 71 127% Diluted earnings per share $ .12 $ .05 140% After-tax profit margin 13.5% 7.9% Return on stockholders' equity 14% 7% - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In reviewing the first quarter, CEO David S. Pottruck commented, "After a solid start in January, securities market returns softened in keeping with mixed economic and geopolitical developments. While client activity slowed as the first quarter progressed, daily average revenue trades for the period were still above year ago and prior quarter levels by 55% and 10%, respectively. Other indicators of client re-engagement continued throughout the first quarter - net inflows to actively-managed equity and balanced mutual funds totaled $8.6 billion, an increase of 47% over the prior quarter, and outstanding margin loans reached $9.1 billion as of March 31, 2004, up 7% from year-end 2003 and 47% higher than the year earlier level. In addition, new and existing clients opened 160,000 new accounts in the first quarter of 2004, the highest quarterly total in a year, and net new client assets totaled $13.8 billion, including $4.6 billion in March. The Company ended the first quarter with $996 billion in client assets, a 31% increase over March 2003." "Our continued ability to attract assets and build stronger client relationships helped the Company to achieve double-digit year-over-year percentage increases in all revenue categories for the first quarter of 2004, and our $1.2 billion in total revenue was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2000," Mr. Pottruck continued. "With the acquisition of SoundView Technology Group, continued selective hiring in certain client-facing positions and seasonal staffing in Operations, our headcount rose to 16,900, up 2% from March 2003. Our ongoing focus on expense management, however, enabled us to continue to rebuild our marketing investment, reinstate our 401(k) match, and allow for a heightened level of employee bonuses while achieving a fifth consecutive quarter of improved net income and a fourth consecutive quarterly after-tax profit margin in excess of 12%." Chairman Charles R. Schwab noted, "Since we declared our last dividend increase in July 2003, the Company's financial performance has continued to improve and our cash flows have remained strong. In recognition of these factors and our confidence in the Company's future, the Board of Directors has approved a 43% increase in Schwab's quarterly cash dividend to 2.0 cents per share." The dividend is payable May 19, 2004 to stockholders of record May 5, 2004. Mr. Pottruck said, "In the first quarter, we took another major step in building a true full-choice, full-service investment firm by introducing Schwab Personal Choice(TM), a new range of investing solutions that allows us to serve the full spectrum of investors based on their unique needs and preferences. In addition to a number of services for clients who manage their own investments, including active traders, Schwab Personal Choice includes new services for clients who seek varying levels of advice from us. Enrollments in our newest advice offerings are running at well over 400 per week. The number of clients using our Schwab Private Client(TM) service, which was introduced in May 2002, has grown to 18,000 by the end of the first quarter of 2004, and their accounts currently hold $18 billion in assets, increases of 98% and 140%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2003. Net new client assets in the 1.3 million accounts at Schwab with an ongoing advisory component - including our new Schwab Advised Investing(TM) services, Foundational and Signature; Schwab Private Client; accounts managed by independent investment advisors (IAs); and U.S. Trust accounts - totaled $8 billion during the first quarter of 2004, and total assets in these accounts equaled $455 billion at quarter-end, up 35% from March 2003. The next stage of our Schwab Personal Choice rollout begins this Wednesday with a broad-based advertising campaign designed to help investors learn more about our advised investing services." Mr. Pottruck said, "Our efforts to combine the best of people and technology to provide better service and improve outcomes for our clients continued during the first quarter. Of note, we rolled out the Rebalancing Wizard, a new tool built to help our investment consultants operate as efficiently as possible. The Wizard automatically overlays client preferences and market viewpoints to variables such as asset allocation, Schwab Equity Ratings(TM), Select List(R) methodology, diversification, and tax considerations to develop a rebalanced portfolio that can be personalized by the investment consultant." "Our Services for Investment Managers (SIM) group continues to strengthen our partnership with the IAs who look to us for unparalleled service, support, and competitive offerings," Mr. Pottruck continued. During the first quarter, we launched the "Take Stock of Your Investments(TM)" promotion aimed at encouraging investors to consolidate their assets with their advisors by offering 30 commission-free trades and rebates on transfer fees for IA clients. We also recently reduced the pricing for standard online equity trades for IA clients to $24.95 from $29.95. During the first quarter, we held a series of 13 workshops across the country as part of our Schwab Advisor Transition Support(TM) services, for the purpose of helping the 240-plus attending firms develop transition plans. We also launched an online advisory firm listing service for potential buyers and sellers that had already attracted 150 postings by quarter-end. Client referrals to IAs through our Schwab Advisor Network(R) program totaled 4,800 during the first quarter of 2004, comparable to the previous quarter and up 9% from the year earlier quarter. At month-end March, client assets at Schwab associated with IA referral programs equaled $21 billion, and total client assets associated with SIM were $304 billion, up 66% and 37%, respectively, from a year ago." Mr. Pottruck added, "U.S. Trust ended the first quarter with 38 offices in its nationwide network. Schwab referred over 400 potential clients to U.S. Trust in the first quarter, compared with about 300 in the first quarter of 2003. At month-end March 2004, client assets at U.S. Trust associated with this referral program totaled $3.5 billion and total client assets were $136 billion, up 84% and 27%, respectively, from March 2003." "Corporate Services finished the first quarter by posting record net new retirement plan assets of $2.1 billion," Mr. Pottruck continued. "Our bundled SchwabPlan(R) 401(k) offering, which currently serves almost 400,000 participants, accounted for 57% of that total, with the balance generated by the unit that provides services to independent third-party recordkeepers. In addition, less than six months after its introduction, our new retirement advice offer has enrolled over 25% of our existing eligible clients. Thus far, participants following this advice have increased their plan contributions by an average of nearly 5 percent of their compensation. Total client assets in employer-sponsored retirement plans at Schwab now total $118 billion, up 31% from the first quarter of 2003." Mr. Pottruck said, "Our Capital Markets group had several important accomplishments during the first quarter. Due to our high-quality trade execution services and our efforts to use automation to build scale, we became the number one market maker in Nasdaq national market stocks during the first quarter of 2004, processing 11% of all shares traded. We also completed the integration of our SoundView acquisition and began the process of leveraging our new platform's unique combination of trade execution and fundamental research capabilities into stronger relationships with our institutional clients. Since the acquisition closed in January, the institutional volume traded by the combined Schwab SoundView Capital Markets(TM) platform has been averaging 25 million shares a day. In addition, our fixed income division achieved another record-breaking quarter with $30 million in revenues. Total client assets held in fixed income securities equaled $150 billion, up 20% from March 2003." Mr. Pottruck added, "The Schwab and AXA Rosenberg Fund adoption was also completed in the first quarter of 2004, formalizing the introduction of the new Laudus Group(TM) of 11 mutual funds to our clients. In addition to providing our clients with more choice, this adoption provides us with a distribution presence on over 100 third-party mutual fund and 401(k) platforms. Overall, client asset balances in mutual funds at Schwab totaled $406 billion at the end of March, including $115 billion in third-party Mutual Fund OneSource(R) funds, $37 billion in our clearing business, $101 billion in other third-party Mutual Fund Marketplace(R) funds, and $153 billion in proprietary funds." "It's been almost a year since Schwab Bank, N.A. began operations and it continues to operate ahead of plan," the CEO commented. "We originated $242 million in first mortgages for the first quarter and outstanding home equity loans reached $443 million by month-end March. The bank ended the first quarter with total assets of $3.3 billion, up 22% from month-end December. In addition, the bank's loan commitments at quarter-end included $257 million in first mortgages and $714 million in unused home equity lines. On the deposit side, the bank ended the quarter with $443 million in outstanding CDs and $2.4 billion in client MMDA balances, down 46% and up 60%, respectively, from year-end 2003."
