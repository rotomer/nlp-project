Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media (San Francisco) Glen Mathison (415) 636-5448 Investors/Analysts Rich Fowler (415) 636-9869 SCHWAB ANNOUNCES CEO RESIGNATION REPORTS QUARTERLY RESULTS POSTS RECORD NON-TRADING REVENUES SAN FRANCISCO, July 20, 2004 - The Charles Schwab Corporation announced today that CEO David S. Pottruck has stepped down, effective immediately. Also effective immediately, the Company's Board of Directors has reappointed Charles R. Schwab to the CEO role; Mr. Schwab will continue to serve as Board Chairman. "During his two decades here at Schwab, David has been a valued partner to me and has worked tirelessly to help this Company pursue its vision," Mr. Schwab said. "As I see the opportunities ahead for Schwab, I want to underscore my confidence in the strength of our franchise, the value we provide our clients, the dedication of our employees, and the depth of our management team." "For nearly 30 years, Schwab's top priorities have been its clients and stockholders," Mr. Pottruck said. "And for 20 of those 30 years, I've been privileged to be part of the Schwab team, working with Chuck and some of the most talented, dedicated people in the investment world. But the last few years have been difficult in the securities markets, and I accept the Board's decision that it's time for me to step aside. It's been a great journey. After taking some time off with my family, I'll start thinking about the next step in my career." Also today, the Company announced that its net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $113 million. In comparison, the Company reported net income of $126 million for the second quarter of 2003 and net income of $161 million for the first quarter of 2004. For the first half of 2004, the Company's net income was $274 million, compared with $197 million earned during the same period in 2003. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended --June 30,-- % --June 30,-- % Financial Highlights 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues (in millions) $1,112 $1,018 9 % $2,302 $1,918 20% Net Income (in millions) $ 113 $ 126 (10)% $ 274 $ 197 39% Diluted earnings per share $ .08 $ .09 (11)% $ .20 $ .14 43% After-tax profit margin 10.2% 12.3% 11.9% 10.2% Return on stockholders' equity 10% 12% 12% 10% - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In reviewing the second quarter, Mr. Schwab commented, "Mixed securities market returns, continuing geopolitical uncertainties and concerns about rising interest rates all weighed on client engagement during much of the quarter. Client daily average revenue trades declined by 20% from the first quarter average, and outstanding margin loans ended the quarter at $9.1 billion, unchanged from month-end March. Excluding a $6.0 billion non-recurring outflow in June relating to our mutual fund clearing business, new and existing clients brought $12.7 billion in net new assets to the Company during the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with $998 billion in client assets, an 18% increase over June 2003." "Our non-trading revenues - asset management and administration fees, net interest income, and other revenues - reached a record level in the second quarter of 2004, evidence of our continued success in building stronger client relationships and diversifying our sources of revenue," Mr. Schwab continued. "The sharp downturn in trading activity overall, however, caused our trading revenues to decline by 26% from the prior quarter, leading to a 7% sequential decline in total revenues. While our ongoing efforts to sustain a significant level of marketing investment and improve employee bonuses limited our sequential decline in expenses to 1%, our firm-wide cost leadership effort is well under way. We remain on track to identify and implement $150 to $200 million in annualized cost savings by the end of this year, with the expectation that the full benefit of these savings will be realized in 2005." Mr. Schwab said, "In the second quarter, we strengthened our value proposition - delivering great service at a great price - by lowering online equity trade commissions for many clients within the Schwab Personal Choice(TM) program. The new pricing, which was rolled out nationwide on June 15, provides clients with the opportunity to reduce their trading costs as they increase either their asset levels or trading activity at Schwab. Even with the recent pullback in client engagement, investors continue to seek us out for access to help and advice. Enrollments in our newest advised offerings are still running at about 400 per week, and the number of clients using our Schwab Private Client(TM) service has grown to about 19,700 by month-end June 2004, an increase of 74% from the second quarter of 2003. Net new client assets in the 1.4 million accounts at Schwab with an ongoing advisory component - including our new Schwab Advised Investing(TM) services, Schwab Private Client, accounts managed by independent investment advisors (IAs), and U.S. Trust accounts - totaled $10 billion during the second quarter of 2004, and total assets in these accounts equaled $465 billion at quarter-end, up 25% from June 2003." "Our Services for Investment Managers (SIM) group continues to offer competitive pricing coupled with unparalleled service and support," the Chairman commented. "Concurrent with our reduced pricing for individual investors, we extended $19.95 standard pricing for online equity trades to most IAs. In addition, IA clients with at least $1 million custodied at Schwab now have access to a flat $9.95 commission rate for online equity trades. Also during the quarter, we launched the PortfolioCenter Relationship Manager(TM), a powerful contact management and office workflow automation system designed to assist IAs in strengthening client and prospect relationships. Client referrals to IAs through our Schwab Advisor Network(R) program totaled just under 4,600 during the second quarter of 2004, down by 5% from the prior quarter. At month-end June, client assets at Schwab associated with IA referral programs equaled $22 billion, and total client assets associated with SIM were $310 billion, up 45% and 25%, respectively, from a year ago." Mr. Schwab added, "Schwab referred over 450 potential clients to U.S. Trust in the second quarter, compared with over 350 in the second quarter of 2003. At month-end June 2004, client assets at U.S. Trust associated with this referral program totaled $4.0 billion and total client assets were $137 billion, up 73% and 20%, respectively, from June 2003." "During the second quarter, Corporate Services attracted another $1.9 billion in net new assets to our retirement plan offerings," Mr. Schwab also noted. "Total client assets in employer-sponsored retirement plans at Schwab now total $121 billion, up 21% from the second quarter of 2003." The Chairman said, "Our Capital Markets group continued to expand its capabilities during the second quarter. For institutional clients, we launched the Passive Indication Network(TM), a system that helps traders access the substantial institutional and retail order flow of the Schwab Liquidity Network(TM) anonymously and with minimal market impact." Mr. Schwab continued, "For clients interested in fixed income securities, we introduced Standard & Poors Ratings Xpress(TM), a tool that provides in-depth information on a bond's credit rating, including credit profiles of bond issuers, the rationale behind upgrades and downgrades, analysts' outlooks and recent news reports. Total client assets held in fixed income securities equaled $149 billion at month-end June, up 14% from a year ago. Also during the quarter, Schwab Bank, N.A. celebrated its one-year anniversary. We originated about $350 million in first mortgages during the second quarter and outstanding home equity loans reached just under $600 million by month-end June. The bank ended the second quarter with total assets of $3.8 billion, up 16% from month-end March 2004. In addition, the bank's loan commitments at quarter-end included approximately $170 million in first mortgages and $880 million in unused home equity lines."
