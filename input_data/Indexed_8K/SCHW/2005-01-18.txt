Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media (San Francisco) Glen Mathison (415) 636-5448 Investors/Analysts Rich Fowler (415) 636-9869 SCHWAB REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS SAN FRANCISCO, January 18, 2005 - The Charles Schwab Corporation announced today that its net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 was $53 million. In comparison, the Company reported a net loss of $41 million for the third quarter of 2004 and net income of $148 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding $62 million in after-tax charges relating to its ongoing cost reduction effort and $49 million in after-tax charges related to the Company's exit from the capital markets business, Schwab's fourth quarter 2004 adjusted operating income was $164 million - up 53% from the $107 million adjusted operating income generated in the prior quarter, and up 12% from the year-ago quarter's $147 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's net income was $286 million, down 39% from 2003. Adjusted operating income for 2004 was $538 million, 10% higher than the 2003 level. A table that reconciles net income to adjusted operating income is attached. In reviewing the Company's performance, Chairman and CEO Charles Schwab commented, "The last six months have been a period of extensive change at Schwab, as we have refocused on our core strategy of meeting the needs of individual investors and the independent advisors who serve them, exited the capital markets business, and launched a firm-wide cost reduction initiative. Throughout all of these corporate actions, however, we have remained focused on building stronger relationships with our clients by reducing our commission rates and enhancing our services - and our progress here is reflected in our fourth quarter client fundamentals. Clients brought a total of $16.8 billion in net new assets to the firm in the fourth quarter, our highest level, excluding asset inflows relating to acquisitions, in 13 quarters. Total client assets were a record $1.081 trillion at year end, up 12% from December 2003. In December, clients opened 56,000 new accounts, 37% higher than November and our best month since April 2004. We believe that providing great service at a great value will enable us to continue to attract investors of all types - independent investors, active traders, and those who want advice." CFO Christopher Dodds noted, "The securities markets improved and client activity picked up during the fourth quarter of 2004, helping the Company to achieve its seventh consecutive quarter of growth in non-trading revenues - asset management and administration fees, net interest income and other revenues reached a new record of $842 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2003. This increase more than offset the impact of our reduced trading commissions and yielded 8% overall revenue growth for 2004. While $261 million in after-tax charges associated with our cost reduction initiative and our exit from the capital markets business contributed to net income of $286 million for the year, those actions have enabled us to dramatically reduce our cost base and improve our margins. Our 15.5% after-tax operating profit margin for the fourth quarter is the highest level since the first quarter of 2000 and reflects our emphasis on improving returns to stockholders. We are entering the new year with a leaner, more focused organization that can continue to rely on a strong balance sheet with $4.4 billion of stockholders' equity. That financial strength enabled us to reduce our long-term debt by $187 million, increase our dividend by 43%, and repurchase $383 million of common stock during the course of 2004."
