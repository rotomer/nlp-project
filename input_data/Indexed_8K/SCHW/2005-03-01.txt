THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On February 23, 2005, at a meeting of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The Charles Schwab Corporation (the Committee), the Committee approved performance criteria under The Charles Schwab Corporation Executive Bonus Plan (the Plan) for 2005. These performance criteria are based on revenue growth and profit margins. Certain executives will be paid bonuses based solely on overall corporate performance, while other executives who lead either an enterprise or business unit will be paid bonuses based on a combination of overall corporate performance and the performance of the enterprise or business unit that they oversee. The application of these business-specific criteria is incorporated into an amendment to the Plan adopted by the Committee, which is subject to approval at The Charles Schwab Corporation's 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 19, 2005. - 1 -
