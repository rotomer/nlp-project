Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media (San Francisco) Glen Mathison (415) 636-5448 Investors/Analysts Rich Fowler (415) 636-9869 SCHWAB REPORTS QUARTERLY RESULTS NET NEW ASSETS TOTAL $16.1 BILLION SAN FRANCISCO, April 15, 2005 - The Charles Schwab Corporation announced today that its net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 was $145 million. In comparison, the Company reported net income of $53 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 and net income of $161 million for the first quarter of 2004. Excluding $19 million in after-tax charges relating to its ongoing cost reduction effort and its exit from the capital markets business, the Company's first quarter 2005 adjusted operating income was $164 million - the same as the prior quarter, and up 3% from the year-ago quarter's $159 million. A table that reconciles net income to adjusted operating income is attached. In reviewing the first quarter, Chairman and CEO Charles Schwab commented, "We remain intensely focused on delivering what Schwab stands for - value, performance and service. In recent months, we've completed a series of price reductions and enhanced our personal service capabilities by expanding our relationship-based investment help. With these moves, I believe we have dramatically improved our value proposition and created a new connection with our clients. Our progress with investors is reflected in both our revenue picture and client asset and account flows. Even as we have reduced the average amount our clients pay for a trade by over 45%, revenues declined by just 4% versus a year ago due to our continued success in building non-trading revenues. Clients brought a total of $16.1 billion in net new assets to the Company in the first quarter, with 65% of these net new assets going into accounts with an ongoing advisory component. In addition, clients opened nearly 58,000 new accounts in March, up 30% from February and our strongest showing since last April. We ended the quarter with $1.077 trillion in client assets, up 8% from a year ago." CFO Christopher Dodds noted, "Even against a backdrop of rising interest rates, continuing concerns about energy prices, and flat to down securities markets, client activity picked up in the first quarter - daily average revenue trades rose by 8% over fourth quarter levels to 191,000, the highest quarterly level in four years. While our reduced commission rates resulted in a 5% sequential drop in trading revenues, the higher rate environment and continued strength in client inflows yielded our eighth consecutive quarterly increase in non-trading revenues, which totaled a record $852 million in the first quarter, up 1% from the prior quarter. Although our total revenues were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter, sharply lower levels of charges associated with our ongoing cost reduction efforts and our exit from the capital markets business enabled us to report net income of $145 million for the first quarter, up from $53 million in the prior period. Our work on improving our margins continues - on an adjusted operating basis, our 25.2% pre-tax profit margin for the first quarter was up 70 basis points from the 24.5% level we achieved in the fourth quarter. We are also continuing to carefully manage our capital base - capital expenditures were just $23 million during the quarter, and we repurchased $234 million of common stock in the first three months of 2005." Mr. Dodds added, "Consistent with recent market volumes and the advent of earnings season, client trading activity has slowed thus far in April - daily average revenue trades for the first 9 trading days of the month totaled 171,000."
