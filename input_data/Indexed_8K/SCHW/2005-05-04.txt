THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On April 28, 2005, at a meeting of the Compensation Committee (Committee) of the Board of Directors of The Charles Schwab Corporation (Schwab), the Committee approved discretionary bonuses for two executive officers of Schwab, William L. Atwell and Walter Bettinger, in the amount of $47,004 and $35,262, respectively. These awards are in addition to amounts paid under the criteria of their respective performance matrices for the first quarter of 2005. The Committee also approved a supplemental compensation arrangement for Mr. Atwell in connection with his assumption of management of Schwab's Individual Investor Enterprise and Schwab's reclassification of Mr. Atwell's expenses during 2003, 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 for travel between residences he maintained on the East Coast and certain business locations (including travel on company aircraft), as personal, rather than business, expenses. The arrangement is composed of (1) a one-time tax reimbursement of up to $327,957; and (2) an ongoing, annual reimbursement allowance of up to $155,000 and related tax reimbursement of up to $125,000, in addition to Mr. Atwell's salary, for travel and related expenses between his residences on the East Coast and Schwab's various business locations. The annual allowance and related tax reimbursement will continue so long as Mr. Atwell manages the Individual Investor Enterprise or until the Committee approves a change to the arrangement. - 1 -
