From continuing operations. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman and CEO Charles Schwab commented, "Over the last year, we have been intensely focused on reconnecting with our clients and improving our financial performance - and this quarter demonstrates that we are succeeding on both fronts. Total client assets reached a record $1.106 trillion at the end of June, up 11% from a year ago. Net new client assets totaled $11.2 billion this quarter, with 85% of these assets going into accounts with an ongoing advice component. Our total revenues grew 5% versus the second quarter of 2004, even in the face of a 28% drop in our trading revenues due to a series of price reductions over the past year. Finally, our net income grew 65% versus a year ago to $186 million, the third-highest level of net income in our Company's 30-year history. I am tremendously grateful for the efforts of Schwab's employees in turning around our Company, and I am excited about working with them as we move the Company forward and deliver the value, performance and service that Schwab stands for." CFO Christopher Dodds noted, "The second quarter of 2005 marked the ninth consecutive quarterly increase in our non-trading revenues, as we continued to benefit from our strength in attracting client assets and the rising interest rate environment. These revenues reached a record $900 million, up 16% from the same period in 2004 - an increase that more than offset the drop in our trading revenues. Our ongoing focus on streamlining and simplifying the Company led to a 9% reduction in expenses versus a year ago, enabling us to post a 28% pre-tax profit margin for the quarter, the second-highest level in Schwab's history. For the first half of 2005, our pre-tax margin totaled 26%, dramatically ahead of the 19% margin we reported for the year earlier period. We also continued our focus on capital management during the second quarter - limiting our capital expenditures to $29 million and repurchasing $149 million of common stock - which helped us to achieve a 17% return on equity, the highest quarterly level since the first quarter of 2000."
