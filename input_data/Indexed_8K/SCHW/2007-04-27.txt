Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On April 25, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) approved compensation for Joseph R. Martinetto, who has been named to replace Christopher V. Dodds as Chief Financial Officer effective upon Mr. Dodds' retirement as Chief Financial Officer on May 18, 2007. The compensation for Mr. Martinetto will be effective May 18, 2007 and consists of the following:
-        An annual base salary of $410,000;
-        A target bonus of 100% of his base salary for an annual cash incentive payment in 2007; and
-        A special one-time award of long-term compensation with a grant date of May 18, 2007, consisting of stock options with a value of $247,500 and restricted stock with a value of $202,500.
The stock options vest 25% on each of the first, second, third, and fourth anniversary of the grant date and have a term of seven years. The number of stock options will be determined by dividing $247,500 by the fair value of an option on the date of grant, and the exercise price of the stock options will be the closing price of a share of CSC's common stock on the date of grant. The number of restricted shares will be determined by dividing $202,500 by the market value of a share of CSC's common stock on the date of grant, which will be determined by the average of the high and low price of a share of CSC's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted shares vest 25% on each of the second and third anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.
