Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
At The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 17, 2007, stockholders approved an amendment to CSC's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan relating to director compensation. Prior to the amendment, non-employee directors received an initial grant of 10,000 stock options upon joining the board. In addition, each non-employee director received an annual, automatic grant of 5,000 stock options and a number of restricted shares equal to $60,000 divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. The amendment provides that each non-employee director will receive an annual, automatic equity grant equal to $125,000, paid 50% in stock options and 50% in restricted stock. The number of stock options will be determined by dividing $62,500 by the fair value of an option on the date of grant, and the exercise price of the stock options will be the closing price of a share of CSC's common stock on the date of grant. The number of restricted shares will be det ermined by dividing $62,500 by the fair market value of a share of CSC's common stock on the date of grant, which will be determined by the average of the high and low price of a share of CSC's common stock on the date of grant. Non-employee directors will receive the pro-rata amount of the annual grant in the first calendar year the director joins the board. Non-employee directors will no longer receive an initial grant of 10,000 stock options upon joining the board.
