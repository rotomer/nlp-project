(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(o) The reference in Exhibit B to the Distribution Agreement to the denominations of the Notes is amended to delete "in principal amounts of U.S. $1,000" and to replace it with "in principal amounts of U.S. $2,000".

If on the Settlement Date any Applicable Underwriter or Applicable Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to UBS and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Applicable Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either UBS or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Settlement Date but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Applicable Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Applicable Underwriter under this Terms Agreement.
provided

Re:
The Charles Schwab Corporation Medium-Term Notes, Series A
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") promulgated thereunder of up to $750,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of debt securities of the Company, and the purchase by you of $250,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of the Company's Medium-Term Notes, Series A due September 1, 2017 (the "Notes"). This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 6(d)(i) of the Terms Agreement dated September 11, 2007, by and among you and the Company (the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the same meanings given them in the Agreement.
As counsel, we have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-36410) (the "Registration Statement"), the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Company's report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the Company's reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2007, and June 30, 2007, the Company's current reports on Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2007, January 26, 2007, February 23, 2007, April 10, 2007, April 17, 2007, April 27, 2007, May 21, 2007, July 3, 2007, and July 17, 2007, the Senior Debt Indenture, the forms of Notes to be issued pursuant to the Senior Debt Indenture, the Distribution Agreement and the Agreement. In addition, we have examined the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Charles Schwab") and such corporate records, certificates and other documents (of which we are aware) and such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinions that follow.
In giving the opinions that follow, we have relied as to matters of fact without investigation, to the extent we deemed proper, upon certificates from officers of the Company, the representations and warranties of the Company in the Agreement, and certificates, telegrams, facsimiles and other documents from, and oral conversations with, public officials. We have assumed without investigation the authenticity of each document submitted to us as an original, the conformity to the originals of each document submitted to us as a copy, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of
all natural persons. Whenever statements or opinions in this letter are made to or qualified by our "knowledge," "the best of our knowledge," our attention, awareness or any similar phrase, we intend to indicate that during the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to the attention of those attorneys currently employed by this law firm who have rendered legal services to the Company in connection with substantive legal matters that would give such attorneys actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statements or opinions. However, except as expressly indicated, we have undertaken no independent investigation to determine the accuracy of any such statement or opinion, and any limited inquiry we may have undertaken in preparing this opinion letter should not be regarded as such an investigation; no inference as to our knowledge of any matters bearing on the accuracy of any such statement or opinion should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company. Further, we call to your attention that the Company is a holding company for, and therefore engages directly or indirectly in, multi-faceted and complex businesses, and that we have not represented the Company in connection with all of its business activities. Accordingly, our actual knowledge typically does not extend to or encompass any matter or issue as to which we have not advised the Company. As used in the opinions that follow, "applicable law" means only (i) those United States Federal and California state statutes, laws, rules and regulations that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated in the Notes, the Senior Debt Indenture, the Distribution Agreement and the Agreement, and (ii) the General Corporation Law of Delaware; that, without suggesting that any of the following might otherwise be applicable to transactions of the type contemplated in the Notes, the Senior Debt Indenture, the Distribution Agreement and the Agreement, "applicable laws" specifically does not include, among other laws, the following "": any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, decisions or administrative interpretations (a) of any county, locality or municipality, (b) pertaining to taxes (except to the limited extent set forth in paragraph 7 below); securities (except for the Trust Indenture Act for purposes of paragraph 3 below and except to the limited extent set forth in paragraphs 6 and 7 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 7 below); the regulation of banks, thrifts, savings and loan associations or any similar entity that is engaged in the business of lending as one of its principal business activities, or holding companies of any of the foregoing; labor, employee or management relations; money laundering; privacy; environment; health and safety; trade regulation; franchising; antitrust; intellectual property; unfair competition; or pension, retirement, deferred compensation or any other employee benefits, including ERISA, (c) relating to choice of law or conflicts of law and/or (d) to which the transactions are or may be subject because of the legal or regulatory status of any person other than the Company or because of any facts pertaining to any such person. Although Excluded Laws may apply to the Notes, the Senior Debt Indenture, the Distribution Agreement or the Agreement (or performance under any of them), we express no opinion with respect to the effect of Excluded Laws on the matters involved in the opinions set forth herein.
provided, however,
Excluded Laws
Any opinion below that any document is enforceable is qualified as to the effects of:
(a) bankruptcy, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, moratorium, insolvency or other similar laws or court decisions relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally;
(b) equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, equitable subordination and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), regardless of whether codified by statute;
(c) the unenforceability of any indemnity obligation imposed on or undertaken by the Company, to the extent such obligation does not satisfy the requirements of Section 2772 . of the California Civil Code and judicial decisions thereunder or otherwise violates public policy;
et
seq
(d) the unenforceability of provisions purporting to require the award of attorneys' fees, expenses or costs, where such provisions do not satisfy the requirement of Section 1717 . of the California Civil Code and judicial decisions thereunder or otherwise violate public policy;
et
seq
(e) the unenforceability, under certain circumstances, of provisions that contain a waiver of (i) broadly or vaguely stated rights, (ii) the benefits of statutory, regulatory or constitutional rights, unless and to the extent the statute, regulation or constitution explicitly allows waiver, (iii) unknown future defenses, and (iv) rights to damages; and
(f) the unenforceability, under certain circumstances, of provisions of agreements to the effect that rights or remedies are not exclusive, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in addition to or with any other right or remedy, or that the election of some particular remedy or remedies does not preclude recourse to one or another remedy.
We express no opinion or view as to any statement superseded or modified or deemed to be superseded or modified pursuant to Rule 412 under the Securities Act.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
1. The Company is a duly incorporated, validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to own its property and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus;
2. Each of the Distribution Agreement and the Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
3. The Senior Debt Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms;
4. The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and issued and, assuming the Notes are duly paid for by the purchasers thereof on the date hereof, the Notes are entitled to the benefits of the Senior Debt Indenture and are valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms;
5. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Distribution Agreement, the Agreement, the Senior Debt Indenture and the Notes, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Distribution Agreement, the Agreement and the Senior Debt Indenture as
of the date hereof, do not contravene (a) any provision of applicable law, or (b) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Charles Schwab, or constitute a default under the Company's Credit Agreement (364-Day Commitment), between the Company, Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent, and the banks listed therein, as lenders, dated as of June 15, 2007, as amended as of August 3, 2007, and the Promissory Notes issued pursuant thereto, or to our best knowledge, after reasonable investigation, any other instrument or agreement binding upon the Company or any subsidiary and evidencing or related to indebtedness for borrowed money, except such instruments and other agreements relating to capitalized lease obligations and installment purchase agreements for the acquisition of fixed assets for which indebtedness does not in the aggregate exceed $15 million; and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or agency is required under applicable law for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Distribution Agreement, the Agreement, the Notes, and the Senior Debt Indenture, except such as are specified and have been obtained;
6. The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes" (in the preliminary pricing supplement dated September 11, 2007 and the final pricing supplement dated September __, 2007, in each case relating to the Notes, in the forms furnished to the Applicable Underwriters, but not including the Prospectus or any information incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein (the "Pricing Supplement")), "Description of Notes" (in the Prospectus Supplement), "Description of Debt Securities" (in the Basic Prospectus), and "Plan of Distribution" (in the Pricing Supplement, the Prospectus Supplement and the Basic Prospectus), in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein; and
7. The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Certain United States Federal Tax Consequences" (in the Pricing Supplement) and "United States Federal Taxation," (in the Prospectus Supplement) are accurate in all material respects.
We are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements. Without limiting the foregoing, we assume no responsibility for, and have not independently verified, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the financial statements and schedules and other financial information and statistical data included in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, and we have not examined the accounting, financial or statistical records from which such financial statements, schedules and data are derived. We note that, although the financial statements and schedules and certain other financial data in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus have been included on the authority of "experts" within the meaning of the Securities Act, we are not such experts with respect to any portion of the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, including without limitation such financial statements or schedules or the other financial or statistical data included therein. However, we are familiar with the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the
Final Prospectus and the information contained therein and have had conferences with certain officers and key employees of, and independent accountants for, the Company and your counsel, during which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and related matters were discussed (except that your counsel did not participate in any such conferences at the time of the preparation and filing of the registration statement on Form S-3 filed by the Company with the Commission on May 19, 2000).
Although we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, in the course of our review of the statements listed above, we have no reason to believe (1) that any document filed by the Company pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, and except for any proxy statement of the Company, as to which we express no opinion or belief), did not comply when so filed as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (2) that (except for the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee, the representations and warranties contained in any exhibit to the Registration Statement and in any document incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package and any proxy statement of the Company, as to which we express no opinion or belief) any part of the Registration Statement, as amended, if applicable, as of the time at which such Registration Statement became effective for purposes of Section 11 of the Act, as such section applies to the Applicable Underwriters, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (3) that the Registration Statement (including for the avoidance of doubt the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Final Prospectus) (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, and except for any proxy statement of the Company, as to which we express no opinion or belief) does not comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (4) that (except for the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, the representations and warranties contained in any document incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus and any proxy statement of the Company, as to which we express no opinion or belief) the Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time, and the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
As you requested, this letter is dated as of September 14, 2007 ("Opinion Date"). The opinions expressed herein are given as of the Opinion Date only, and are not given as of any later date. We have not undertaken any factual or legal investigation beyond the Opinion Date, and we disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person after the Opinion Date if any change in fact and/or law should change our opinion with respect to any matters set forth herein.
We are members of the bar of the State of California. We express no opinion as to any laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States, in each case to the extent applicable and not excepted from the scope of the opinions expressed above.
This opinion is rendered to you as Applicable Underwriters under the Agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person, other than by your counsel in rendering the opinions contemplated by the Agreement, without our express written consent.

Re:
The Charles Schwab Corporation Medium-Term Notes, Series A
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President and Associate General Counsel of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 6(d)(ii) of the Terms Agreement dated September 11, 2007 (the "Agreement"), by and among you and the Company regarding the purchase by you of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Medium-Term Notes, Series A, due September 1, 2017. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, have the same meanings given them in the Agreement.
I have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-36410) (the "Registration Statement"), the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007. In addition, I have examined the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab"), Schwab Holdings, Inc. ("Schwab Holdings"), Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. ("CSIM"), and Charles Schwab Bank, National Association ("Schwab Bank"), and such corporate records, certificates and other documents (of which I am aware) and such questions of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering the opinions that follow.
In giving the opinions that follow I have relied as to matters of fact without investigation, to the extent I deemed proper, upon certificates from officers of the Company and certain of its affiliates, and certificates, telegrams, facsimiles, and other documents from, and oral conversations with, public officials. I have assumed without investigation the authenticity of each document submitted to me as an original, the conformity to the originals of each document submitted to me as a copy, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons. For purposes of the opinions delivered in paragraph 2 below, I have relied upon certificates dated as of recent dates from public officials and confirmations received from public officials.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. The Company is a duly incorporated, validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
2. Each of Schwab, Schwab Holdings, CSIM, and Schwab Bank is a duly incorporated, validly existing corporation or, in the case of Schwab Bank, a national bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the corporate power and authority to own its property and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and each of Schwab, Schwab Holdings, and CSIM is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
3. Each of the Company, Schwab, Schwab Holdings, CSIM, and Schwab Bank has all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals, orders, certificates and permits of and from, and has made all declarations and filings with, all federal, state, local and other governmental authorities, all self-regulatory organizations and all courts and other tribunals, to own, lease, license and use its properties and assets and to conduct its business in the manner described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, except to the extent that the failure to obtain or file would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
4. The statements (a) in "Item 3Legal Proceedings" of Part I of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, (b) in "Item 1  Legal Proceedings" of Part II of the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007, incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, and (c) in "Employment Agreement for Mr. Schwab", "License Agreement for Mr. Schwab", "Offer Letter for Mr. Scaturro" and "Retention Agreement for Mr. Scaturro" included under the "Narrative to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards" section of the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2007 Proxy Statement"), filed and incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein; and, to my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or
to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and are not so described, or any statutes or regulations that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, that are not described as required; and
5. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or to be filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to such Registration Statement that are not described, filed or incorporated as required; and
6. Each of the Company, Schwab, Schwab Holdings, CSIM, and Schwab Bank is duly registered as a bank holding company, bank, broker-dealer, municipal securities broker or dealer, investment adviser or transfer agent, as the case may be, in each jurisdiction wherein the conduct of its business requires such registration, and each of the Company Schwab, Schwab Holdings, CSIM, and Schwab Bank is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, by-laws and similar requirements in connection with such registrations, except to the extent that the failure to be so registered or be in compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
7. Schwab is a member in good standing of the associations and exchanges indicated in the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and is registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, except to the extent that the failure to be in good standing or be so registered would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
8. To the best of my knowledge, after reasonable investigation, (i) the execution and delivery by the Company of the Distribution Agreement, the Agreement, the Senior Debt Indenture and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Distribution Agreement, the Agreement and the Senior Debt Indenture, and (ii) the execution and delivery by the Company of the Notes did not violate as of their respective dates and as of the date hereof, do not violate, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary (except such contravention that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole); and
9. The 2007 Proxy Statement, filed and incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein as to which I express no opinion), complied when so filed as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and no facts have come to my attention which would lead me to believe that (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included therein as to which I express no opinion) the 2007 Proxy Statement incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package as of the Applicable Time, and the Final Prospectus as of its date and as of the date hereof, contained or contains, as the case may be, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits, as the case may be, to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
This opinion is dated as of September 14, 2007 ("Opinion Date"). The opinions expressed herein are given as of the Opinion Date only, and are not given as of any later date. I have not undertaken any factual or legal investigation beyond the Opinion Date, and I disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person after the Opinion Date if any change in fact and/or law should change my opinion with respect to any matters set forth herein.
I am a member of the bar of the State of California. I express no opinion as to any laws of any other jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States to the extent applicable to the scope of the opinions expressed above. Further, I express no opinion regarding choice of law or conflicts of laws.
This opinion is rendered to you as Agents under the Agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my express written consent.
 
1. Each of the Applicable Underwriters represents and agrees that:
(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) ("FSMA")) to persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 or in circumstances in which Section 21 of the FSMA does not apply to Company; and

Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the "Prospectus Directive" in that Relevant Member State, and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
