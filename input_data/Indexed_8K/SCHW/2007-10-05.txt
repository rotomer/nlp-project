Pre-Pricing Prospectuses, the Prospectus and the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or (3) since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any downgrading, or any notice or announcement shall have been given or made of: (A) any intended or potential downgrading or (B) any watch, review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act.
If you elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 7, the Company and each other Underwriter shall be notified promptly in writing.
If the sale to the Underwriters of the Securities, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this Agreement, or if such sale is not carried out because either of the Offerors shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Offerors shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(o), 5 and 9 hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to Offerors under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof) or to one another hereunder.
8. . Subject to Sections 6 and 7 hereof, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Securities to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6 hereof or a reason sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Section 7 hereof) and if the number of Securities which all Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total number of Securities, the non-defaulting Underwriters (including the Underwriters, if any, substituted in the manner set forth below) shall take up and pay for (in addition to the aggregate number of Securities they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the number of Securities agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided.

Increase in Underwriters' Commitments
Schedule A
Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Securities hereunder unless all of the Securities are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by you with the approval of the Company or selected by the Company with your approval).
If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or by the Company for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Company or you shall have the right to postpone the Time of Purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in the Registration
 
Statement and the Prospectus and other documents may be effected.
The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in hereto.
Schedule A
If the aggregate number of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total number of Securities which all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Company shall make arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase of all the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of the Offerors to any Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter to the Offerors. Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
9. .

(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "") is brought against a person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or an Underwriter (as applicable, the "") pursuant to
Proceeding
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
provided
however
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an
 
indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person
 
(including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.
10. . The statements set forth in the fourth, eighth and ninth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, only insofar as such statements relate to the amount of selling concession and reallowance or to over-allotment and stabilization activities that may be undertaken by the Underwriters, constitute the only information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriters, as such information is referred to in Sections 3 and 9 hereof.

We have further assumed that each of the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company is duly qualified to engage in the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; that the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of, each of the parties thereto other than Company, and are enforceable against the parties thereto other than the Company in accordance with their respective terms; that the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company have the requisite power and authority to perform their respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements executed and delivered by them; that there are no documents, agreements or understandings among or between any parties to the Transaction Agreements or others that would modify the respective rights and obligations of such parties as set forth in the Transaction Agreements or that otherwise would have an effect on the opinions rendered below; and that each person or entity that has any right to seek to enforce any provision of the Indenture or the Junior Subordinated Notes has filed any California tax returns it is required to file and has paid any California franchise or income taxes it is required to pay under the laws of the State of California.
As to matters of fact material to our opinions, we have relied solely upon our review of the documents referred to in the second paragraph of this letter. We have assumed that the recitals of fact and the representations and warranties of all parties as to factual matters set forth in the documents referred to above are true, complete and correct on the date hereof. We have not independently verified any factual matters or the validity of any assumptions made by us in this letter, and we express no opinion or belief, and disclaim any implication or inference, as to the reasonableness of any such assumption.
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have considered only Applicable Laws (as defined herein). "" means the Delaware General Corporation Law and those laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the United States of America and the State of California presently in effect that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Without suggesting that any of the following might otherwise be applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, "Applicable Laws" specifically does not include, among other laws, the following "": any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, decisions or administrative interpretations (a) of any county, locality or municipality, (b) pertaining to taxes; securities (except the Securities Act for purposes of

Although Excluded Laws may apply to the Transaction Agreements (or performance under any of them), we express no opinion with respect to the effect of Excluded Laws on the matters involved in the opinions set forth herein.
Whenever a statement or opinion herein is qualified by the phrase "known to us," "to our knowledge," "of which we are aware," or any similar phrase, we intend to indicate that during the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to the attention of those attorneys currently employed by this law firm who have rendered legal services to the Company in connection with substantive legal matters that would give such attorneys actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statements or opinions. We have not undertaken or conducted any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of statements or opinions herein qualified as described in the preceding sentence, and any limited inquiry undertaken by us during the preparation of this opinion letter should not be regarded as such an investigation; no inference as to our knowledge of any matters bearing on the accuracy of any such statement or opinion should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company. Further, we call to your attention that the Company is a holding company for, and therefore engages directly or indirectly in, multi-faceted and complex businesses, and that we have not represented the Company in connection with all of its business activities. Accordingly, our actual knowledge typically does not extend to or encompass any matter or issue as to which we have not advised the Company.
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following:
(i) The factual basis for our opinions in paragraph 1 below is based solely on our review of the Charters, the Minute Books, the Good Standing Certificates and the Officers' Certificates;
(ii) Our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d) below are based solely upon an examination of the Company Contracts. We have made no further investigation. With regard to the Company Contracts, we have assumed with respect to each Company Contract that such Company Contract would be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and that it is governed by the substantive laws of the State of California (without regard to conflicts-of-law and choice-of-law principles), even though the terms of such Company Contract may provide that the law of a jurisdiction other than California is the governing law of such Company Contract. We express no opinion as to any statement or writing that may constitute parol

evidence bearing on interpretation or construction of any Company Contract. Further, to the extent that any of the Company Contracts contain any financial covenants, provisions relating to the occurrence of a "material adverse effect" or similar provisions, for purposes of our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d) below, we have relied solely on the Officers' Certificates as to (i) the Company's compliance with any and all such provisions, and (ii) the conclusion that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantee and the Trust Agreement do not, under any such provisions, constitute a default or result in the imposition of a lien or encumbrance, and we have undertaken no investigation or analysis, nor conducted any financial computations, with respect thereto;
(iii) Our opinion in the first sentence of paragraph 6 below is based solely upon the Order and oral advice from the staff of the Commission;
(iv) We have assumed that the Junior Subordinated Notes have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Indenture Trustee and that the Trust Preferred Securities have been validly issued by the Trust and duly authenticated by the Property Trustee;
(v) Except to the limited extent set forth in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 12 below, we express no opinion whatsoever as to the compliance or noncompliance by any person with antifraud or information delivery provisions of state or federal laws, rules and regulations;
(vi) We express no opinion or view as to any statement superseded or modified or deemed to be superseded or modified pursuant to Rule 412 under the Securities Act; and
(vii) We express no opinion regarding the rights or remedies available to any party for material violations or breaches that are the proximate result of actions taken by any party other than the party against whom enforcement is sought.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Company, Holdings and CSIM is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. CS & Co. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California. The Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the states of California, and .

The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement.

Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Board of Directors of the Company.
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under each of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantee and the Trust Agreement on the date hereof in accordance with their respective terms do not (a) violate the Charters or the Bylaws, (b) violate any judgment, writ, decree or order of any court to which the Company is named as a party and of which we are aware, (c) constitute a default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary under any Company Contract, or (d) result in the imposition of a lien or encumbrance on any material properties of the Company or of any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to any Company Contract. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Trust Agreement, and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Indenture on the date hereof in accordance with their respective terms, do not violate any Applicable Law, , , that the foregoing opinion, insofar as it pertains to performance, is subject to the same limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth in paragraph 4 below.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President and Associate General Counsel of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated October , 2007 (the "Agreement"), by and among you, the Trust and the Company regarding the purchase by you of $300,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of Fixed to Floating Rate Trust Preferred Securities of Schwab Capital Trust I and Guaranteed by The Charles Schwab Corporation. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, have the same meanings given them in the Agreement.
    
I have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-114729) (the "Registration Statement"), the Prospectus Supplement, the Disclosure Package, the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007. In addition, I have examined the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab"), Schwab Holdings, Inc. ("Schwab Holdings"), Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. ("CSIM"), and Charles Schwab Bank, National Association ("Schwab Bank"), and such corporate records, certificates and other documents (of which I am aware) and such questions of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering the opinions that follow.
In giving the opinions that follow I have relied as to matters of fact without investigation,
 
to the extent I deemed proper, upon certificates from officers of the Company and certain of its affiliates, and certificates, telegrams, facsimiles, and other documents from, and oral conversations with, public officials. I have assumed without investigation the authenticity of each document submitted to me as an original, the conformity to the originals of each document submitted to me as a copy, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons. For purposes of the opinions delivered in paragraphs 1 and 2 below, I have relied upon certificates dated as of recent dates from public officials and confirmations received from public officials.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. Schwab Bank is a national bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
2. Each of Schwab, Schwab Holdings, Schwab Bank and CSIM is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
3. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and are not so described; and
This opinion is dated as of October , 2007 ("Opinion Date"). The opinions expressed herein are given as of the Opinion Date only, and are not given as of any later date. I have not undertaken any factual or legal investigation beyond the Opinion Date, and I disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person after the Opinion Date if any change in fact and/or law should change my opinion with respect to any matters set forth herein.
    
I am a member of the bar of the State of California. I express no opinion as to any laws of any other jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States to the extent applicable to the scope of the opinions expressed above. Further, I express no opinion regarding choice of law or conflicts of laws.
This opinion is rendered to you as Underwriters under the Agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my express written consent.

The opinion hereinafter expressed is subject to the following qualifications:
(a) Our opinions are based upon current authorities, including, among other things, statutes, regulations, Department of Labor advisory opinions and case authority. These authorities are subject

(b) We are members of the State Bar of California and express no opinion as to any matter relating to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal law of the United States of America referred to herein as ERISA.

Subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth above and in the Prospectuses, the statements made in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus under the heading "Certain ERISA Considerations," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of such matters or conclusions in all material respects.
This opinion is provided solely for your benefit in connection with the above-described transaction.
This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, and may not be made available to or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent; provided that this opinion may be made available to, but not relied upon by, your legal counsel as well as any governmental authority to whose jurisdiction you are subject.

Our opinions are rendered only with respect to Delaware laws and rules, regulations and orders thereunder that are currently in effect.
Based upon the foregoing, and upon our examination of such questions of law and statutes of the State of Delaware as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good standing as a statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, 12 Del. C.  3801, et seq. (the "Delaware Statutory Trust Act"), and all filings required under the laws of the State of Delaware with respect to the creation and valid existence of the Trust as a statutory trust have been made.
2. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Trust has the trust power and authority to own property and conduct its business, all as described in the Prospectus.
3. The Trust Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company and the Trustees, and is enforceable against the Company and the Trustees, in accordance with its terms.
4. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Trust has the trust power and authority to (a) execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the
 
Underwriting Agreement, (b) issue and perform its obligations under the Trust Securities and (c) purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes.
5. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the execution and delivery by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, and the performance by the Trust of its obligations thereunder, have been duly authorized by all necessary trust action on the part of the Trust.
6. The Trust Preferred Securities of the Trust have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and, when executed and delivered in accordance with the Trust Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and, subject to the qualifications set forth below, fully paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust and are entitled to the benefits provided by the Trust Agreement. The Trust Preferred Security Holders, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We note that the Preferred Security Holders may be obligated to make payments as set forth in the Trust Agreement.
7. The Common Securities have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and, when executed and delivered in accordance with the Trust Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and, subject to the qualifications set forth below, fully paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust and entitled to the benefits provided by the Trust Agreement.

9. No authorization, approval, consent or order of any Delaware court or Delaware governmental authority or Delaware or regulatory authority or agency is required to be obtained by the Trust solely in connection with the issuance and sale of the Trust Securities and the execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement.

The Trust Preferred Security Holders (other than those Trust Preferred Security Holders who reside or are domiciled in the State of Delaware) will have no liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware solely as a result of their participation in the Trust, and the Trust will not be liable for any income tax imposed by the State of Delaware.

12. The issuance, sale and delivery by the Trust of the Trust Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the purchase by the Trust of the Junior Subordinated Notes and the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement, Underwriting Agreement and Trust Securities and compliance by the Trust with its obligations thereunder do not violate (i) any of the provisions of the Certificate or the Trust Agreement or (ii) any Delaware law or administrative regulation thereunder which is applicable to the Trust. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, the certificates attached to the Trust Agreement as Exhibit B and Exhibit C are appropriate forms of certificates to evidence ownership of the Common Securities and Trust Preferred Securities, respectively.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders.

(iv) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Sponsor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
(v) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default, negligence or misconduct of the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor;

Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid mailed at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All such notices of liquidation shall:
(i) state the CUSIP number of the Trust Securities;
(ii) state the Liquidation Date;
(iii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Notes; or if Section 9.4(d) applies, a right to receive a Liquidation Distribution; and

(d) In the event that, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Junior Subordinated Notes in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Trust shall be dissolved, wound-up or terminated, by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee determines. In such event, on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or other termination of the Trust, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the ""). If, upon any such dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holder of the Trust Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Trust Preferred Securities, except that, if a Note Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trust Preferred Securities shall have a priority over the Trust Common Securities.

counsel, unless such officer or counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions, or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
Section 1.4 Acts of Holders.
(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given to or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments is or are delivered to the Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. The Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of such instruments or instruments delivered to the Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a Person acting in other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
(c) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient and in accordance with such reasonable rules as the Trustee may determine.
(d) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
 
(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
(f) The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date, provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 5.2, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 5.7(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 5.12, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date, provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date
 
for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record date may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day, provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
(g) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail or delivered by hand or overnight courier, neither the failure to mail or deliver by hand or overnight courier such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed or delivered by hand or overnight courier, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest, provided that, no Extension Period shall exceed consecutive or extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security. Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements.

Section 3.2 Denominations.
The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons and shall be issuable in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1.
Section 3.3 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, Vice Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer (or any co-Chief Executive Officer if the title is allocated to more than one Person), President, Chief Financial Officer or one of its Vice Presidents under its corporate seal reproduced or impressed thereon and attested by its Treasurer, Secretary or one of its Assistant or Associate Treasurers or its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.9, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 3.4 Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of such series in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for that purpose without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms as such temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
Section 3.5 Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. Such register is herein sometimes referred to as the "Securities Register." The Trustee is hereby appointed "Securities Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated for that purpose the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, of the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms.
At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, of the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Securities Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and
 
the Securities Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Securities.
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as depositary, in each case unless the Company has approved a successor Depositary within 90 days, (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security, (C) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security will be so exchangeable or transferable or (D) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 3.1.
(3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 3.4, 3.6, 9.6 or 11.6 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
 
Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required, pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (a) to issue, transfer or exchange any Security of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of selection for redemption of Securities pursuant to Article XI and ending at the close of business on the day of mailing of notice of redemption or (b) to transfer or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, any portion thereof not to be redeemed.
Section 3.6 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same issue and series of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same issue and series of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity as such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) connected therewith.
Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.7 Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Interest on any Security of any series which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest in respect of Securities of such series, except that, unless otherwise provided in the Securities of such series, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of the principal of a Security shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. The initial payment of interest on any Security of any series which is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall be payable as provided in such Security or in the Board Resolution pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to the related series of Securities. At the option of the Company, interest on any series of Securities may be paid (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it shall appear on the Securities Register of such series or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such account as designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register of such series.
Any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not timely paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series (herein called "Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series in respect of which interest is in default (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such
 
Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Security of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Securities Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee shall in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in a newspaper, customarily published in the English language on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of the series in respect of which interest is in default may be listed or traded and, upon such notice as may be required by such exchange (or by the Trustee if the Securities are not listed), if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Any interest on any Security which is deferred or extended pursuant to Section 3.11 shall not be Defaulted Interest for purposes of this Section 3.7.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 3.8 Persons Deemed Owners.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to Section 3.7) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 3.9 Cancellation.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and
 
any such Securities and Securities surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities shall be disposed of by the Trustee in its customary manner and the Trustee shall deliver to the Company a certificate of such disposal upon its request therefor.
Section 3.10 Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series for any period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and interest on the Securities of each series for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 3.11 Deferrals of Interest Payment Dates.
If specified as contemplated by Section 2.1 or Section 3.1 with respect to the Securities of a particular series, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right, at any time during the term of such series, from time to time to defer the payment of interest on such Securities for such period or periods as may be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 (each, an "Extension Period") during which Extension Periods the Company shall have the right to make partial payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date. No Extension Period shall end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date. At the end of any such Extension Period the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid on the Securities (together with Additional Interest thereon, if any, at the rate specified for the Securities of such series to the extent permitted by applicable law) to the Persons in whose names that the Securities are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Extension Period; provided, however, that no Extension Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of the Securities of such series; and provided, further, that during any such Extension Period, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock, or (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt security of the Company that ranks with or junior in interest to the Securities of such series or make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of the debt securities of any Subsidiary of the Company that by their terms rank with or junior in interest to the Securities of such series (other than (a) dividends or distributions in the capital stock of the Company, (b) any declaration of a
pari passu
pari passu
 
dividend in connection with the implementation of a Rights Plan, the issuance of any rights, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights distributed pursuant to a Rights Plan, (c) payments under any Schwab Guarantee and (d) purchases of Common Stock related to the issuance of Common Stock or rights under any of the Company's benefit plans for its directors, officers or employees, related to the issuance of Common Stock or rights under a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or related to the issuance of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction that was entered into prior to the commencement of such Extension Period). Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest, provided that no Extension Period shall exceed the period or periods specified in such Securities or extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of such Securities. Upon termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof. The Company shall give the Holders of the Securities of such series and the Trustee notice of its election to begin any such Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date on which interest on Securities of such series would be payable but for such deferral or, with respect to the Securities issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, so long as such Securities are held by such Schwab Capital Trust, prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Preferred Securities would be payable but for such deferral or (ii) the date the Administrative Trustees of such Schwab Capital Trust are required to give notice to any securities exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to holders of such Preferred Securities on the record date such Distributions are payable, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such record date.
The Trustee shall promptly give notice of the Company's election to begin any such Extension Period to the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series.
Section 3.12 Right of Set-Off.
With respect to the Securities of a series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, the Company shall have the right to set-off any payment it is otherwise required to make thereunder in respect of any such Security to the extent that the Company has theretofore made, or is concurrently on the date of such payment making, a payment under the Schwab Guarantee relating to such Security or under Section 5.8 of this Indenture.
Section 3.13 Agreed Tax Treatment.
Each Security issued hereunder shall provide that the Company and, by its acceptance of a Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person
 
that acquires a beneficial interest in, such Security agree that for United States Federal, State and local tax purposes it is intended that such Security constitute indebtedness.
Section 3.14 Shortening or Extension of Stated Maturity.
If specified as contemplated by Section 2.1 or Section 3.1 with respect to the Securities of a particular series, the Company shall have the right to (i) shorten the Stated Maturity of the principal of the Securities of such series at any time to any date not earlier than the first date on which the Company has the right to redeem the Securities of such series and (ii) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of the Securities of such series at any time at its election for one or more periods, but in no event to a date later than the 49th anniversary of the first Interest Payment Date following the Original Issue Date of the Securities of such series; provided that, if the Company elects to exercise its right to extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of the Securities of such series pursuant to clause (ii), above, at the time such election is made and at the time of extension (A) the Company is not in bankruptcy, otherwise insolvent or in liquidation, (B) the Company is not in default in the payment of any interest or principal on such Securities, (C) in the case of any series of Securities issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, such Schwab Capital Trust is not in arrears on payments of Distributions on the Preferred Securities issued by the Schwab Capital Trust and no deferred Distributions are accumulated and (D) such Securities are rated not less than BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or the equivalent by any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization. In the event the Company elects to shorten or extend the Stated Maturity of the Securities, it shall give notice to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall give notice of such shortening or extension to the Holders, no less than 30 and no more than 60 days prior to the effectiveness thereof.
Section 3.15 CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" and/or other similar numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" and/or other numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" and/or other numbers.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.7, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.2 and the last paragraph of Section 10.3 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
Section 4.2 Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.3, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for the payment of which such money or obligations have been deposited with or received by the Trustee.
Section 5.1 Events of Default.
"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to the Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
(1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series, including any Additional Interest in respect thereof, when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (subject to the deferral of any interest payment date in the case of an Extension Period); or
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of that series at its Maturity; or
(3) default in the performance, or breach, in any material respect, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in the performance of which or the breach of which is elsewhere in this
 
Section specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied; or
(4) the entry of a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
(5) the institution by the Company of proceedings to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or the consent by it to the filing of any such petition or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit for creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due and its willingness to be adjudicated a bankrupt, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or
(6) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
Section 5.2 Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(4) or 5.1(5)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), provided that, in the case of the Securities of this series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, if upon an Event of Default, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series fail to declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified
 
in the terms of the series) of all the Securities of this series to be immediately due and payable, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then outstanding shall have the right by a notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee; and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified portion thereof) of and the accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) on all the Securities of such series shall become immediately due and payable. Payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article XIII notwithstanding that such amount shall become immediately due and payable as herein provided. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(4) or 5.1(5) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms of that series) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A) all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest) on all Securities of that series,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Securities, and
(C) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
In the case of Securities of a series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, the holders of a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the related series of Preferred Securities issued by such Schwab Capital Trust shall also have the right to rescind and
 
annul such declaration and its consequences by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Clauses (1) and (2) above of this Section 5.2.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.3 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company covenants that if:
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal, including any sinking fund payment or analogous obligations (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest); and, in addition thereto, all amounts owing the Trustee, its agents and counsel under Section 6.7.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 5.4 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors,
 
(a) the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal (and premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest)) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amounts as may be due and payable pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 6.2 and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) owing and unpaid in respect to the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable and to take any and all actions as are authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have the claims of the Holders and any predecessor to the Trustee under Section 6.7 allowed in any such judicial proceedings; and
(ii) in particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 5.6; and
(b) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee for distribution in accordance with Section 5.6, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.7.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.
Section 5.5 Trustee May Enforce Claim Without Possession of Securities.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of all the amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.7, its agents and counsel,
 
be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Section 5.6 Application of Money Collected.
Any money or property collected or to be applied by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities pursuant to this Article, after reserving therefrom by the Trustee an amount sufficient, in the determination of the Trustee, to cover the expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee that may be incurred thereafter, shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money or property on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest), upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any predecessor Trustee, its agents and counsel under Section 6.7;
SECOND: Subject to Article XIII, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon such series of Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest), in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such series of Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest), respectively; and
THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company.
Section 5.7 Limitation on Suits.
No Holder of any Securities of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
 
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing itself of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
Section 5.8 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest; Direct Action by Holders of Preferred Securities.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. In the case of Securities of a series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, any holder of the corresponding series of Preferred Securities issued by such Schwab Capital Trust shall have the right, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 5.1(1) or 5.1(2), to institute a suit directly against the Company for enforcement of payment to such holder of principal of (premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest (including any Additional Interest) of the Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of such Preferred Securities of the corresponding series held by such holder.
Section 5.9 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
Section 5.10 Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided in the last paragraph of Section 3.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 5.11 Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee, any Holder of any Security or any holder of any Preferred Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders and the right and remedy given to the holders of Preferred Securities by Section 5.8 may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee, the Holders or the holders of the Preferred Securities, as the case may be.
Section 5.12 Control by Holders.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that:
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture,
(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and
(3) subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction if a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee shall, in good faith, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or would otherwise be contrary to applicable law.
Section 5.13 Waiver of Past Defaults.
The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series and, in the case of any Securities of a series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, the holders of Preferred Securities issued by such Schwab Capital Trust,
 
may waive any past default hereunder and its consequences with respect to such series except a default:
(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security of such series, or
(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
Any such waiver shall be deemed to be on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series or, in the case of a waiver by holders of Preferred Securities issued by such Schwab Capital Trust, by all holders of Preferred Securities issued by such Schwab Capital Trust.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.14 Undertaking for Costs.
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security.
Section 5.15 Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws.
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly
 
waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Section 6.1 Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,
(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct except that
(1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of Holders pursuant to Section 5.12 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any
 
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series.
(d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
Section 6.2 Notice of Defaults.
Within 90 days after actual knowledge by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear in the Securities Register, notice of such default, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security of such series, the Trustee shall be fully protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a committee of Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of Securities of such series; and provided, further, that, in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 5.1(3), no such notice to Holders of Securities of such series shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series.
Section 6.3 Certain Rights of Trustee.
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1:
(a) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, Security, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

(d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, indenture, Security or other paper or document, but the Trustee in its discretion may make such inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;

(j) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder;

(l) in no event shall the Trustee be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits), irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
Section 6.4 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of the Securities or the proceeds thereof.
Section 6.5 May Hold Securities.
The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Securities Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Securities Registrar or such other agent.
Subject to the limitations imposed by the Trust Indenture Act, nothing in this Indenture shall prohibit the Trustee from becoming and acting as trustee under other indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest of participation in other securities, of the Company are outstanding in the same manner as if it were not Trustee hereunder.
Section 6.6 Money Held in Trust.
Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability
 
for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company.
 
Section 6.7 Compensation and Reimbursement.
The Company agrees:
(1) to pay to each of the Trustee, the Securities Registrar, the Authentication Agent and any Paying Agent, as the case may be, from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by them, as may be applicable, hereunder in such amounts as the Company and the Trustee, the Securities Registrar, the Authentication Agent and any Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall agree from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
(2) to reimburse each of the Trustee, the Securities Registrar, the Authentication Agent and any Paying Agent, as the case may be, upon their request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by any one of them in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as shall be caused by its own negligence or bad faith; and
(3) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify each of the Trustee, the Securities Registrar, the Authentication Agent and any Paying Agent, as the case may be, and their predecessors, their officers, directors, shareholders, employees and agents for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, tax, penalty, claim, damage or expense (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust or the performance of their duties hereunder, including the enforcement of this provision and the costs and expenses of defending themselves against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder. This indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. This Section 6.7 shall survive the termination of this Indenture or the earlier resignation or removal of the Trustee.
To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Company and the Holders agree that the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee. Such lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
In addition to and without prejudice to its rights hereunder, when the Property Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with a default or Event of Default, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar law.
 
"Trustee" for the purposes of this Section shall include any predecessor Trustee; provided, however, that the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Trustee hereunder shall not affect the rights of any other Trustee hereunder.
Section 6.8 Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture.
Section 6.9 Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be:
(a) a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State, Territorial or District of Columbia authority, or

Section 6.14 Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
 
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, or of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent shall be the successor Authenticating Agent hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 1.6 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with
 
like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 6.7.
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Securities referred to in the within mentioned Indenture.

The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of Trust Indenture Act Section 314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of same shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificate).

Section 10.3 Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents, it will, prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on each due date of the principal of or interest on any Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal and premium (if any) or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest (including Additional Interest) on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest (including Additional Interest);
(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent; and
(4) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest (including Additional Interest) on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall (unless otherwise required by mandatory provision of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law) be paid on Company Request to the Company, or (if then held by the Company) shall (unless otherwise required by mandatory provision of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law) be discharged from such trust; and the
 
Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees and agents or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. In the absence of a written request from the Company to return unclaimed funds to the Company, the Trustee shall from time to time deliver all unclaimed funds to or as directed by applicable escheat authorities, as determined by the Trustee in its sole discretion, in accordance with the customary practices and procedures of the Trustee. Any unclaimed funds held by the Trustee pursuant to this Section shall be held uninvested and without any liability for interest.

The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each calendar year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate covering the preceding calendar year, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of or compliance with any of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Indenture, and if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. For the purpose of this Section 10.4, compliance shall be determined without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice provided pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.

For the purpose of this Section 10.4, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default.
Section 10.5 Waiver of Certain Covenants.
The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any covenant or condition provided pursuant to Section 3.1, 9.1(3) or 9.1(4) with respect to the Securities of any series, if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of
 
at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
Section 10.6 Corporate Existence.
Subject to Article VIII, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and its rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of its business and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
Section 10.7 Additional Sums.
In the case of Securities of a series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.1 or Section 3.1, if (i) a Schwab Capital Trust is the Holder of all of the Outstanding Securities of a series, (ii) a Tax Event in respect of such Schwab Capital Trust shall have occurred and be continuing and (iii) the Company shall not have (A) redeemed the Securities of such series pursuant to the terms of this Indenture or (B) terminated such Schwab Capital Trust pursuant to Section 9.2(b) of the applicable Schwab Capital Trust Agreement, the Company shall pay to such Schwab Capital Trust (and its permitted successors and assigns under the related Trust Agreement) for so long as such Schwab Capital Trust (or its permitted successors or assignees) is the registered holder of any Securities of such series, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the amount of Distributions (including any Additional Amounts (as defined in such Schwab Capital Trust Agreement)) then due and payable by such Schwab Capital Trust on the related Preferred Securities and Common Securities that at any time remain outstanding in accordance with the terms thereof shall not be reduced as a result of any Additional Taxes (the "Additional Sums"). Whenever in this Indenture or the Securities there is a reference in any context to the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payments of the Additional Sums provided for in this paragraph to the extent that, in such context, Additional Sums are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph and express mention of the payment of Additional Sums (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Sums in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made; provided, however, that the deferral of the payment of interest pursuant to Section 3.11 or the Securities shall not defer the payment of any Additional Sums that may be due and payable.
 
Section 10.8 Additional Covenants.
The Company covenants and agrees with each Holder of Securities of each series that it shall not, and it shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, (a) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of the Company's capital stock, or (b) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt security of the Company that rank with or junior in interest to the Securities of such series or make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of debt securities of any Subsidiary of the Company if such guarantee ranks with or junior in interest to the Securities (other than (a) dividends or distributions in capital stock of the Company, (b) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a Rights Plan, the issuance of any rights, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights distributed pursuant to a Rights Plan, (c) payments under any Schwab Guarantee, and (d) purchases of Common Stock related to the issuance of Common Stock or rights under any of the Company's benefit plans for its directors, officers or employees, related to the issuance of Common Stock or rights under a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or related to the issuance of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction that was entered into prior to the commencement of the event referred to below) if at such time (i) there shall have occurred any event of which the Company has actual knowledge that (A) with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series and (B) in respect of which the Company shall not have taken reasonable steps to cure, (ii) if the Securities of such series are held by a Schwab Capital Trust, the Company shall be in default with respect to its payment of any obligations under the Schwab Guarantee relating to the Preferred Securities issued by such Schwab Capital Trust or (iii) the Company shall have given notice of its election to begin an Extension Period with respect to the Securities of such series as provided herein and shall not have rescinded such notice, or such Extension Period, or any extension thereof, shall be continuing.

The Company also covenants with each Holder of a series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust (i) to maintain directly or indirectly 100% ownership of the Common Securities of such Schwab Capital Trust; provided, however, that any permitted successor of the Company hereunder may succeed to the Company's ownership of such Common Securities, (ii) not to voluntarily terminate, wind-up or liquidate such Schwab Capital Trust, except (a) in connection with a distribution of the Securities of such series to the holders of the Preferred Securities of such Schwab Capital Trust in liquidation of such Schwab Capital Trust or (b) in connection with certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations permitted by the related Schwab Capital Trust Agreement and (iii) to use its reasonable efforts, consistent with the terms and provisions of such Schwab Capital Trust Agreement to cause such Schwab Capital Trust to remain classified as a grantor
 
trust and not an association taxable as a corporation for United States Federal income tax purposes.
Section 11.1 Applicability of this Article.
Redemption of Securities of any series (whether by operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) as permitted or required by any form of Security issued pursuant to this Indenture shall be made in accordance with such form of Security and this Article; provided, however, that if any provision of any such form of Security shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the provision of such form of Security shall govern. Except as otherwise set forth in the form of Security for such series, each Security of such series shall be subject to a partial redemption only in the amount of $25 or, in the case of the Securities of a series issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, $25, or integral multiples thereof.
Section 11.2 Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of any Securities of a series, the Company shall, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such date and of the principal amount of Securities of that series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel evidencing compliance with such restriction.
Section 11.3 Selection of Securities to be Redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination; provided that, Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part, but only in integral multiples of $1,000) for such Security. If less than
 
all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for partial redemption and the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct, Securities registered in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any Subsidiary thereof shall not be included in the Securities selected for redemption.
Section 11.4 Notice of Redemption.
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than the thirtieth day, and not earlier than the sixtieth day, prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Securities Register.
With respect to Securities of each series to be redeemed, each notice of redemption shall state:
(a) the Redemption Date;
(b) the Redemption Price;
(c) if less than all Outstanding Securities of such particular series and having the same terms are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
(d) that on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, and accrued interest, if any, will become due and payable upon each such Security or portion thereof, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date;
(e) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
(f) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and
(g) the CUSIP and/or other similar number as contemplated by Section 3.15.
 
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall not be irrevocable. If the latter, the Company will give the Trustee at least 15 business days' prior written notice of such request. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security.
Section 11.5 Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in Section 11.4, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and any accrued interest (including Additional Interest) on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
Section 11.6 Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
If any notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 11.4, the Securities or portion of Securities with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable Redemption Price and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Security shall cease to bear interest. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a Place of Payment in said notice specified, the said securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable Redemption Price, together with accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7.
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented and having the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Security will also be a new Global Security.
 
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal of and premium, if any, on such Security shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
Section 11.7 Right of Redemption of Securities.
Subject to obtaining prior approval from the Federal Reserve if then required under applicable capital adequacy guidelines, regulations or policies of the Federal Reserve:
(a) if at any time, a Special Event in respect of a Schwab Capital Trust, the Company may, at its option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at any time within 90 days of the occurrence of such Special Event redeem the applicable Security, in whole but not in part, subject to the provisions of this Article XI, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if at the time there is available to the Company or the Schwab Capital Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, the Special Event by taking some ministerial action, such as filing a form or making an election or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that will have no adverse effect on the Schwab Capital Trust, the Company or the Holders, then the Company or the Schwab Capital Trust will pursue such measure in lieu of redemption; and
(b) in the case of the Securities of a series initially issued to a Schwab Capital Trust, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, the Company, at its option, may at any time, on or after the date that is 10 years after the Original Issue Date and subject to the terms of this Article XI redeem such Securities in whole at any time or in part from time to time.
Section 12.1 Applicability of Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any sinking fund payment in excess of such minimum amount which is permitted to be made by the terms of such Securities of any series is herein referred to as
 
an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
Section 12.2 Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
In lieu of making all or any part of a mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option, at any time no more than 16 months and no less than 30 days prior to the date on which such sinking fund payment is due, deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series (together with the unmatured coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company, except Securities of such series that have been redeemed through the application of mandatory or optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of the Securities of such series, accompanied by a Company Order instructing the Trustee to credit such obligations and stating that the Securities of such series were originally issued by the Company by way of bona fide sale or other negotiation for value; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price for such Securities, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 12.3 Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.1) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 12.2 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Such Officers' Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such Officers' Certificate (or, as required by this Indenture, the Securities and coupons, if any, specified in such Officers' Certificate), the sinking fund payment due on the succeeding sinking fund payment date for such series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of the Securities of such series subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the right to deliver or credit securities as provided in Section 12.2 and without the right to make the optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series at such time.
 
Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made with respect to the Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date immediately following the date of such payment) to the redemption of Securities of such series at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities with respect to the sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust by the Company as provided in Section 10.3) for such series and together with such payment (or such amount so segregated) shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.3. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 10.3) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Securities of such series at Maturity. The Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.3 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 11.6. On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) in cash a sum in the currency in which Securities of such series are payable (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.1) equal to the principal and any interest accrued to the Redemption Date for Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section 12.3.
Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall redeem any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on any Securities of such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to the Securities of such series, except that if the notice of redemption shall have been provided in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee (or the Company, if the Company is then acting as its own Paying Agent) shall redeem such Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article XII. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking
 
fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of the Securities and coupons, if any, of such series; provided, however, that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for the Securities of such series on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section 12.3.
Section 13.1 Securities Subordinate to Senior Debt.
The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article, the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) on each and all of the Securities are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt.
Section 13.2 Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company (each such event, if any, herein sometimes referred to as a "Proceeding"), then the holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on such Senior Debt, or provision shall be made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive or retain any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (including any payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other Debt of the Company (including any series of the Securities) subordinated to the payment of the Securities, such payment or distribution being hereinafter referred to as a "Junior Subordinated Payment"), on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities by the Company or any Subsidiary and to that end the holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment thereof, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any Junior Subordinated Payment, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities in any such Proceeding; provided, however, that holders of Senior Debt shall not be entitled to receive payment of any such amounts to the extent that such holders would be required by the subordination provisions of such Senior Debt to pay such amounts over to the
 
obligees on trade accounts payable or other liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business.
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any Junior Subordinated Payment, before all amounts due or to become due on all Senior Debt are paid in full or payment thereof is provided for in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution, have been made actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all amounts due or to become due on all Senior Debt remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all amounts due or to become due on all Senior Debt in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt; provided, however, that holders of Senior Debt shall not be entitled to receive payment of any such amounts to the extent that such holders would be required by the subordination provisions of such Senior Debt to pay such amounts over to the obligees on trade accounts payable or other liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business.
For purposes of this Article only, the words "any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment which securities are subordinated in right of payment to all then outstanding Senior Debt to substantially the same extent as the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the sale of all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article VIII shall not be deemed a Proceeding for the purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by sale such properties and assets as an entirety, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, or sale comply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII.
Section 13.3 Prior Payment to Senior Debt Upon Acceleration of Securities.
In the event that any Securities are declared due and payable before their Stated Maturity, then and in such event the holders of the Senior Debt outstanding at the time such Securities so become due and payable shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due on or in respect of such Senior Debt (including any amounts due
 
upon acceleration), or provision shall be made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, properties or securities (including any Junior Subordinated Payment) by the Company on account of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities by the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with this Indenture or as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for the Securities of any series by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 12.2 or as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for the Securities of any series Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such declaration of acceleration; provided, further, however, that holders of Senior Debt shall not be entitled to receive payment of any such amounts to the extent that such holders would be required by the subordination provisions of such Senior Debt to pay such amounts over to the obligees on trade accounts payable or other liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business.
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company.
The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with respect to which Section 13.2 would be applicable.
Section 13.4 No Payment When Senior Debt in Default.
(a) In the event and during the continuation of any default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Debt, or in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Debt shall have occurred and be continuing and shall have resulted in such Senior Debt becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, unless and until such event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist and such acceleration shall have been rescinded or annulled; or
(b) in the event any judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in payment or such event or default, then no payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, properties or securities (including any Junior Subordinated Payment) shall be made by the Company on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest), if any, on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities by the Company or any
 
Subsidiary, in each case unless and until all amounts due or to become due on such Senior Debt are paid in full; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with this Indenture or as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for the Securities of any series by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 12.2 or as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for the Securities of any series Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such default in payment or event of default; and provided further, however, that holders of Senior Debt shall not be entitled to receive payment of any such amounts to the extent that such holders would be required by the subordination provisions of such Senior Debt to pay such amounts over to the obligees on trade accounts payable or other liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business.
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with respect to which Section 13.2 would be applicable.
Section 13.5 Payment Permitted If No Default.
Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time except during the pendency of any Proceeding referred to in Section 13.2 or under the conditions described in Sections 13.3 and 13.4, from making payments at any time of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest (including Additional Interest) on the Securities, or (b) the application by the Trustee of any money deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities or the retention of such payment by the Holders, if, at the time of such application by the Trustee, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee did not have actual knowledge that such payment would have been prohibited by the provisions of this Article.
Section 13.6 Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Debt.
Subject to the payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on all Senior Debt to the extent provided herein, or the provision for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior Debt pursuant to the provisions of this Article (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company which by its express terms is subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company to substantially the
 
same extent as the Securities are subordinated to the Senior Debt and is entitled to like rights of subrogation by reason of any payments or distributions made to holders of such Senior Debt) to the rights of the holders of such Senior Debt to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Debt until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (including Additional Interest) on the Securities shall be paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Debt of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior Debt by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Debt, and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior Debt.

(i) If the Company has raised some but not all Eligible Proceeds necessary to pay all accrued and unpaid deferred interest on any Interest Payment
 
Date pursuant to this Section 2.7, such Eligible Proceeds will be allocated to pay accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred, subject to the Share Cap Amount, Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap.
(ii) If the Company has outstanding Parity Securities under which the Company is obligated to sell securities that are Qualifying APM Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of accrued and unpaid deferred interest or distributions on such Parity Securities, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from those sales and available for payment of the accrued and unpaid deferred interest and distributions will be applied to the Junior Subordinated Notes and those other Parity Securities on a pro rata basis up to the Share Cap Amount, the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, as applicable (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing those other Parity Securities) in proportion to the total amounts of accrued and unpaid deferred interest or distributions that are due on the Junior Subordinated Notes and such other Parity Securities at such time, or, so long as the Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve, on such other basis as the Federal Reserve may approve.

Section 2.8
Redemption of the Junior Subordinated Notes
(a) . Section 11.7 of the Indenture shall not apply to the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Junior Subordinated Notes shall be redeemable, at the Company's option, at any time, including on or after the Scheduled Maturity Date. The redemption price shall be 100% of the principal amount of Junior Subordinated Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the Redemption Date, in the case of any redemption (i) in whole or in part on November 15, 2017 (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next Business Day); (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days after the occurrence of a Capital Treatment Event (applicable only so long as the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve) or Investment Company Event; (iii) in whole but not in part at any time after November 15, 2017 and within 90 days after the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Rating Agency Event; or (iv) in whole or in part at any time on or after November 15, 2037. In all other cases, the redemption price will equal the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price. The
Redemption
 
Company will notify the Trust of the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price (if applicable) promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trust, the Trustee and the Calculation Agent will have no responsibility for calculating the Make-Whole Redemption Price. The Make-Whole Redemption Price will be calculated by the Premium Calculation Agent. The Company may not redeem the Junior Subordinated Notes in part if the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded, unless all accrued and unpaid interest including deferred interest has been paid in full on all outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes for all Interest Periods terminating on or before the Redemption Date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days before the Redemption Date to (x) the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, if the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, is the sole Holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes; and (y) each holder of Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed at its registered address in all other cases. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Junior Subordinated Notes called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused, interest on such Junior Subordinated Notes will continue to accrue at the then applicable rate, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Company for such Junior Subordinated Notes to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
(b) . The Junior Subordinated Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund payments or similar provisions.
Sinking Fund

(iv) so long as the Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve, a receiver is appointed for a Major Subsidiary Depository Institution.
(b) The first paragraph of Section 5.2 of the Indenture will not apply to the Junior Subordinated Notes and such paragraph is replaced with the following paragraph:

(c) If the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes do not rescind and annul any declaration and its consequences under Section 5.2 of the Indenture and the Junior Subordinated Notes are owned beneficially by the Trust or the Property Trustee, the holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Trust Preferred Securities shall have such right, subject to the satisfaction of clauses (1) and (2) of Section 5.2 of the Indenture.
(d) No waiver under Section 5.13 of the Indenture shall be effective until the holders of a majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust Preferred Securities shall have consented to such waiver.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available under the Indenture to the Trustee, the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes or the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be an Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes other than those specified as Events of Default in Section 2.9(a).
(g) The Company shall not enter into any supplemental indenture with the Trustee to add any additional event of default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes without the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes.

Securities Registrar; Paying Agent
Section 2.11 . Each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Junior Subordinated Notes, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event of the Company shall occur before the redemption or repayment of such Junior Subordinated Notes, such Holder shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any deferred interest pursuant to Section 2.5 that has not been paid pursuant to Sections 2.5 and 2.7 to the extent the amount of such interest exceeds the sum of (x) interest (including Additional Interest) that relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not been paid and (y) an amount equal to such Holder's pro rata share of the excess, if any, of the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap over the aggregate amount of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Preferred Stock and still outstanding Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock that the Company has applied to pay such deferred interest pursuant to Section 2.7. Each Holder of Junior Subordinated Notes shall be deemed to agree that, to the extent the remaining claim exceeds the amount set forth in clause (x), the amount it receives in respect of such excess shall not exceed the amount it would have received the claim for such excess ranked equally with the interests of the Holders, if any, of Qualifying Preferred Stock.
Limitation on Claims in the Event of Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Receivership

So long as any Junior Subordinated Notes are held by or on behalf of the Trust, any holder of the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the Trust shall have the right, upon (i) the breach by the Company of its obligations under Section 2.2(a) to issue Qualifying Capital Securities or Section 2.7 to issue Qualifying APM Securities, (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 2.9(a) or (iii) the failure of the Company to make any payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes when due, to institute a suit directly against the Company (a) in the case of (i) above, to enforce such obligations or for such other remedies as may be available and (b) in the case of (ii) or (iii) above, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7 of the Indenture) interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Junior Subordinated Notes having a principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of such Trust Preferred Securities. This right of Direct Action cannot be amended in any manner that would impair the rights of the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities without the consent of all such holders.

Section 3.2 . If less than all the Junior Subordinated Notes are to be repaid on any Repayment Date (unless the Junior Subordinated Notes are issued in the form of a Global Security or held by the Property Trustee), the particular Junior Subordinated Notes to be repaid will be selected not more than 60 days before such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes not previously repaid or called for redemption, by lot or such other method as the Trustee will deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Junior Subordinated Notes; that the portion of the principal amount of any Junior Subordinated Notes not repaid will be in an authorized denomination (which will not be less than the minimum authorized denomination).

We have acted as special structuring counsel to The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-114729) (the "Registration Statement") filed by Schwab Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), and the Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to (i) the issuance by the Trust of Fixed to Floating Rate Trust Preferred Securities representing beneficial ownership interests in the Trust (the "Trust Preferred Securities") and (ii) the issuance by the Guarantor of the Guarantee with respect to the obligations of the Trust under the Trust Preferred Securities (the "Guarantee"). The Trust Preferred Securities and the Guarantee are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Securities." The Securities are being offered and sold pursuant to the Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, and the prospectus dated May 5, 2004 contained therein, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated October 2, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
The Guarantee has been issued pursuant to a Guarantee Agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement") between the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Guarantee Trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"), which has been filed with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on the date hereof.
 
 
We have examined the Registration Statement and the Guarantee Agreement. We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate and other records, agreements, documents and other instruments and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.

as Guarantor, and The Bank of New York, as Guarantee Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Trust Securities. All capitalized terms used in this opinion letter and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
In delivering this opinion letter, we have reviewed and relied upon: (i) the Disclosure Package; (ii) the Indenture; (iii) the Junior Subordinated Notes; (iv) the Trust Agreement; (v) the Guarantee; (vi) the Trust Securities; (vii) the Replacement Capital Covenant dated as of October 5, 2007 by the Company (collectively, the "") and (viii) certain representations and confirmations made by the Company as to certain factual and financial matters as we have deemed relevant to our opinions (including the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company as to factual matters contained in the Underwriting Agreement); and have made such other investigations as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
Transaction Documents
In rendering the opinions described below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have further assumed the due execution and delivery of all documents, where due execution and delivery are a prerequisite to the enforceability or effectiveness thereof. We also have assumed that the transactions related to the issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Trust Securities will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents and forms of documents described herein.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein and in the Disclosure Package, we are of the opinion that (i) assuming that the Trust was formed and will be maintained in compliance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, (ii) although the matter is not free from doubt, the Junior Subordinated Notes will be treated as debt for federal income tax purposes and (iii) the statements contained in the Disclosure Package under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute in all material respects accurate summaries of such matters or conclusions, as the case may be.
We express no opinions with respect to the transactions referred to herein or in the Disclosure Package other than as expressly set forth herein. Moreover, we note that the Junior Subordinated Notes are a novel financial instrument, that there is no authority directly on point dealing with securities such as the Trust Securities or transactions of the type described herein and that our opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court, either of which could take positions or make determinations contrary to, or inconsistent with, our position. Nevertheless, we believe that the opinions expressed herein, if challenged, would be sustained by a court with jurisdiction in a properly presented case decided on the basis of current law (including applicable legal precedent and authorities).
We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the federal law of the United States. The opinions set forth above are given only as of the date hereof.

SECTION 4. Termination, Amendment and Waiver
(a) The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the "") to occur of:
Termination Date
(i) the date, if any, on which the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-effective series of Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the obligations of the Corporation hereunder,
 
(ii) the date on which the Corporation and the Largest Depository Institution Subsidiary cease to have any series of outstanding Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (b) of the definition of each such term),
(iii) November 15, 2047 or, if earlier, the date on which the Securities are otherwise repaid, redeemed or purchased in full in accordance with this Replacement Capital Covenant, and
(iv) the date on which the Junior Subordinated Notes become accelerated due to the occurrence of an event of default.
From and after the Termination Date, the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be of no further force and effect.
(b) This Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed by the Corporation with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-effective series of Covered Debt, that this Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Corporation (and without the consent of any Covered Debtholder) if:
provided
(i) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, Qualifying Warrants, Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and/or Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity as a Replacement Capital Security and, in the case of this clause (i), after the date of this Replacement Capital Covenant, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Stock, Qualifying Warrants, Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and/or Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity as a Replacement Capital Security would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States;
(ii) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt; or
(iii) the effect of such amendment or supplement is solely to impose additional restrictions on, or eliminate (subject to clause (i) in the circumstances where it applies) certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities, and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate to that effect.
For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of Qualifying Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of the Qualifying Capital Securities described herein would not be adverse to the rights of the Covered Debtholders if, following such amendment or supplement, this Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy clause (ii) of the definition of Qualifying Replacement Capital Covenant.
(c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
 
SECTION 5. Miscellaneous
(a) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be governed by, and construed in accordance, with the laws of the State of California.
(b) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be binding upon the Corporation and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Debtholders as they exist from time-to-time (it being understood and agreed by the Corporation that any Person who is a Covered Debtholder shall retain its status as a Covered Debtholder for so long as the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money owned by such Person is Covered Debt and if such Person initiates an action, claim or proceeding to enforce its rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant after the Corporation has violated its covenants in Section 2 and before the series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed held by such Person is no longer Covered Debt, such Person's rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall not terminate by reason of such series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed no longer being Covered Debt).
(c) All demands, notices, requests and other communications to the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if in writing (including by telecopy) and (i) if served by personal delivery upon the Corporation, on the day so delivered (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), or (ii) if delivered by registered post or certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent to the Corporation by a national or international courier service, on the date of receipt by the Corporation (or, if such date of receipt is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), or (iii) if delivered by telecopy, on the date of receipt by the Corporation, and confirmed by telecopy answerback, and in each case to the Corporation at the address set forth below, or at such other address as the Corporation may thereafter notify to Covered Debtholders or post on its website as the address for notices under this Replacement Capital Covenant:
