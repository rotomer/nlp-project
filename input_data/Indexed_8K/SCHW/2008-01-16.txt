SAN FRANCISCO, January 16, 2008  The Charles Schwab Corporation announced today that its income from continuing operations (which excludes the impact of U.S. Trust) was $305 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, up 36% from the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the company's income from continuing operations was a record $1.1 billion, up 26% from 2006.
 
Chairman and CEO Charles Schwab commented, "In 2007, we grew revenues 16% and set new records for income and earnings per share from continuing operations. These results reflected our focus on earning our clients' loyalty and helping them achieve better financial outcomes, while continuing to improve our own financial performance. Net new assets rose 92% in 2007 to $160 billion, including $23 billion relating to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company, and total client assets rose 17% to $1.4 trillion at year-end. Clients opened 809,000 brokerage accounts during the year, up 24%, and total brokerage accounts rose 5% to 7.0 million by the end of December. In addition, by year-end 2007 we were serving 262,000 bank accounts and 1.2 million retirement plan participants, up from 147,000 and 542,000, respectively, at year-end 2006. I'm particularly proud of our achievements in a year that proved so challenging for the financial services industry."
CFO Joe Martinetto said, "Schwab's financial objectives for 2007 included revenue growth of at least 12% and pre-tax profit margin expansion of about 200 basis points, to 36%. With revenues driven by our success with clients and careful expense management helping achieve a 37% margin, we've once again delivered on our ongoing commitment to combine solid growth with improved profitability. We also completed a major capital restructuring during 2007, which incorporated a $1.2 billion special cash dividend, a $2.1 billion stock tender offer, and the issuance of $550 million of new debt capital. Including the restructuring, regular dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.2 billion of equity to stockholders during 2007. We've established a leaner, lower-cost capital structure while maintaining ample liquidity. Schwab retains a strong, flexible balance sheet to serve its growing client base."
