(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, a Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or a Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "") is brought against a person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or an Underwriter (as applicable, the "") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party

or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged
 
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.

We have further assumed that each of the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company is duly qualified to engage in the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; that the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of, each of the parties thereto other than Company, and are enforceable against the parties thereto other than the Company in accordance with their respective terms; that the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company have the requisite power and authority to perform their respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements executed and delivered by them; and that there are no documents, agreements or understandings among or between any parties to the Transaction Agreements or others that would modify the respective rights and obligations of such parties as set forth in the Transaction Agreements or that otherwise would have an effect on the opinions rendered below.

As to matters of fact material to our opinions, we have relied solely upon our review of the documents referred to in the second paragraph of this letter. We have assumed that the recitals of fact and the representations and warranties of all parties as to factual matters set forth in the documents referred to above are true, complete and correct on the date hereof. We have not independently verified any factual matters or the validity of any assumptions made by us in this letter, and we express no opinion or belief, and disclaim any implication or inference, as to the reasonableness of any such assumption.
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have considered only Applicable Laws (as defined herein). "" means the Delaware General Corporation Law and those laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the United States of America and the State of California presently in effect that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Without suggesting that any of the following might otherwise be applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, "Applicable Laws" specifically does not include, among other laws, the following "": any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, decisions or administrative interpretations (a) of any county, locality or municipality, (b) pertaining to taxes; securities (except the Securities Act for purposes of paragraphs 5 through 9 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 11 below, the Trust Indenture Act for purposes of paragraph 10 below, and the Investment Company Act for purposes of paragraph 11 below); the regulation of banks, thrifts, savings and loan associations or any similar entity that is engaged in the business of lending as one of its principal business activities, or holding companies of any of the foregoing; labor, employee or management relations; money laundering; privacy; environment; health and safety; trade regulation; franchising; antitrust; intellectual property; unfair competition; or pension, retirement, deferred compensation or any other employee benefits, including ERISA, (c) relating to choice of law or conflicts of law and/or (d) to which the transactions are or may be subject because of the legal or regulatory status of any person other than the Company or because of any facts pertaining to any such person. Although Excluded Laws may apply to the Transaction Agreements (or performance under any of them), we express no opinion with respect to the effect of Excluded Laws on the matters involved in the opinions set forth herein.
Applicable Laws
Excluded Laws
Whenever a statement or opinion herein is qualified by the phrase "known to us," "to our knowledge," "of which we are aware," or any similar phrase, we intend to indicate that during the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to the attention of those attorneys currently employed by this law firm who have rendered legal services to the Company in connection with substantive legal matters that would give such attorneys actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statements or opinions. We have not undertaken or conducted any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of statements or opinions herein qualified as described in the preceding sentence, and any limited inquiry undertaken by us
 
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
UBS Securities LLC
June 5, 2009
Page 5
during the preparation of this opinion letter should not be regarded as such an investigation; no inference as to our knowledge of any matters bearing on the accuracy of any such statement or opinion should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company. Further, we call to your attention that the Company is a holding company for, and therefore engages directly or indirectly in, multi-faceted and complex businesses, and that we have not represented the Company in connection with all of its business activities. Accordingly, our actual knowledge typically does not extend to or encompass any matter or issue as to which we have not advised the Company.
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following:
(i) The factual basis for our opinions in paragraph 1 below is based solely on our review of the Charters, the Minute Books, the Good Standing Certificates and the Officers' Certificates;
(ii) Our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d) below are based solely upon an examination of the Company Contracts. We have made no further investigation. With regard to the Company Contracts, we have assumed with respect to each Company Contract that such Company Contract would be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and that it is governed by the substantive laws of the State of California (without regard to conflicts-of-law and choice-of-law principles), even though the terms of such Company Contract may provide that the law of a jurisdiction other than California is the governing law of such Company Contract. We express no opinion as to any statement or writing that may constitute parol evidence bearing on interpretation or construction of any Company Contract. Further, to the extent that any of the Company Contracts contain any financial covenants, provisions relating to the occurrence of a "material adverse effect" or similar provisions, for purposes of our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d) below, we have relied solely on the Officers' Certificates as to (i) the Company's compliance with any and all such financial covenants and provisions, and (ii) the conclusion that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture do not, under any such financial covenants or provisions, constitute a default or result in the imposition of a lien or encumbrance, and we have undertaken no investigation or analysis, nor conducted any financial computations, with respect thereto;
(iii) Our opinion in the first sentence of paragraph 6 below is based solely upon oral advice from the staff of the Commission;
(iv) We have assumed that the Securities have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee;
(v) Except to the limited extent set forth in paragraphs 8 and 9 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 11 below, we express no opinion whatsoever as to the compliance or noncompliance by any person with antifraud or information delivery provisions of state or federal laws, rules and regulations;
 
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

(vi) We express no opinion or view as to any statement superseded or modified or deemed to be superseded or modified pursuant to Rule 412 under the Securities Act; and
(vii) We express no opinion regarding the rights or remedies available to any party for material violations or breaches that are the proximate result of actions taken by any party other than the party against whom enforcement is sought.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Company, Holdings and CSIM is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. CS & Co. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California. The Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the State of California. CS & Co. is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington.
2. Each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries has the corporate power and corporate authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement. The Company's execution, delivery and performance of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President and Associate General Counsel of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated June 2, 2009 (the "Agreement"), by and among you and the Company regarding the purchase by you of $750,000,000 4.950% Senior Notes due 2014 of The Charles Schwab Corporation. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, have the same meanings given them in the Agreement.
I have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-156152) (the "Registration Statement"), the Prospectus Supplement, the Disclosure Package, the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, as updated by the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on June 1, 2009 relating to the Company's realigned segment reporting structure, the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 and the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on June 1, 2009 relating to the Company's realigned segment reporting structure. In addition, I have examined the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab"), Schwab Holdings, Inc. ("Schwab Holdings"), Charles Schwab Investment
 
Management, Inc. ("CSIM"), and Charles Schwab Bank ("Schwab Bank"), and such corporate records, certificates and other documents (of which I am aware) and such questions of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering the opinions that follow.
In giving the opinions that follow I have relied as to matters of fact without investigation, to the extent I deemed proper, upon certificates from officers of the Company and certain of its affiliates, and certificates, telegrams, facsimiles, and other documents from, and oral conversations with, public officials. I have assumed without investigation the authenticity of each document submitted to me as an original, the conformity to the originals of each document submitted to me as a copy, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons. For purposes of the opinions delivered in paragraphs 1 and 2 below, I have relied upon certificates dated as of recent dates from public officials and confirmations received from public officials.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. Schwab Bank is a federal savings bank under the supervision of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
2. Each of Schwab, Schwab Holdings, Schwab Bank and CSIM is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualifications, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
3. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and are not so described.
This opinion is dated as of June 5, 2009 ("Opinion Date"). The opinions expressed herein are given as of the Opinion Date only, and are not given as of any later date. I have not undertaken any factual or legal investigation beyond the Opinion Date, and I disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person after the Opinion Date if any change in fact and/or law should change my opinion with respect to any matters set forth herein.
I am a member of the bar of the State of California. I express no opinion as to any laws of any other jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States to the extent applicable to the scope of the opinions expressed above. Further, I express no opinion regarding choice of law or conflicts of laws.
This opinion is rendered to you as Underwriters under the Agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my express written consent.
 
 
I, Joseph R. Martinetto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""), on behalf of the Company, do hereby certify pursuant to Section 6(h) of that certain Underwriting Agreement dated June 2, 2009 (the "") among the Company and, on behalf of the several Underwriters named therein, J.P.

Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer or counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.

The Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such instrument or instruments delivered to the Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a Person acting in other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
 
(c) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient and in accordance with such reasonable rules as the Trustee may determine.
(d) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register.
(e) The principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, may be proved by the production of such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed, as depositary, by any trust company, bank, banker or other depositary, wherever situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer Security, if such certificate or affidavit is deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, (2) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other person, (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding.
(f) The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing, the authority of the Person executing the same and the principal amount and serial number of Bearer Securities held by the Person so executing such instrument and writing and the date of holding the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.
(g) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
(h) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the identity of Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series; provided that, the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that, no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record
 
date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 5.2, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 5.7(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 5.12, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that, no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record date may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that, no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
(i) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
 
Section 1.5    Notices, Etc. to Trustee and Company.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Unit, or
(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose (except as otherwise provided in Section 5.1) hereunder if in writing and mailed, first-class, postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company, Attention: Corporate Treasurer.

If the party elects to give the Trustee e-mail or facsimile instructions (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the Trustee acts upon such instructions, the Trustee's reasonable understanding of such instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee's reliance upon and compliance with such instructions to the extent that such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with the originally executed written instruction subsequently provided to the Trustee. The party providing electronic instructions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk or interception and misuse by third parties.
Section 1.6    Notice to Holders; Waiver.
Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any series of Securities of any event:

(b) such notice shall be sufficiently given to Holders of Bearer Securities if published in an Authorized Newspaper in the City of New York and, if the Securities of such series are then listed on any stock exchange and such stock exchange shall so require, in any other required city outside the United States or, if not practicable, elsewhere on a Business Day
 
at least twice, the first such publication to be not earlier than the earliest date, and not later than the latest day, prescribed for the giving of such notice; it being understood that the Company shall notify the Trustee of any of the foregoing requirements a reasonable amount of time prior to the date on which such notice must be given (but in no event less than five Business Days).
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail or delivered by hand or overnight courier, neither the failure to mail or to deliver by hand or overnight courier such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed or delivered by hand or overnight courier, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided above.
In case by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice mailed to Holders of Registered Securities as provided above.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to a Holder of a Global Security, such notice shall be sufficiently given if given to the Depositary for such Security (or its designee), pursuant to its Applicable Procedures, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice.
Section 1.7    Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

If any of the terms of the Securities of any series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and may be issued from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Indenture. Unless otherwise provided in an indenture supplemental hereto, a series of Securities may be reopened to issue additional series of such Securities.
Section 3.2     Denominations.
The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such form and denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Registered Securities of such series shall be issuable only as Securities without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and the Bearer Securities of each series, if any, shall be issuable with coupons and in denominations of $1,000 and $5,000.
Section 3.3     Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, Vice Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer (or any co-Chief Executive Officer if the title is allocated to more than one Person), President, Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer under its corporate seal reproduced or impressed thereon and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
Securities and coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, a copy of such Board Resolution, the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series and an Opinion of Counsel stating,
 
(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
(3) that such Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication; and unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, each Bearer Security and any temporary Global Security shall be dated as of the date of the issuance of such Security.
No Security or coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.9, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 3.4     Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of such series
 
in lieu of which they are issued in registered form or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In the case of any series that may be issuable as Bearer Securities, such temporary Securities may be Global Securities, representing such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein.
Except in the case of temporary Global Securities, each of which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraph, if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for that purpose without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms as such temporary Securities; provided however, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided further, that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 3.3. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
Without unnecessary delay, but in any event not later than five Business Days prior to the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary Global Securities as the "Exchange Date," the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, or, if the Trustee appoints an Authenticating Agent pursuant to Section 6.14, to any such Authenticating Agent, definitive Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary Global Security, executed by the Company. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, such definitive Securities shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as may be appropriate. On or after the Exchange Date, such temporary Global Security shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee or any such Authenticating Agent, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge to the Depositary and the Trustee or any such Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary Global Securities, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary Global Security to be exchanged, which, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, shall be in the form of Bearer Securities, if applicable, or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof in writing delivered to the Trustee; provided, however, that unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security, upon such presentation by the Depositary, such temporary Global Security is accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date; and provided, further, that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of a temporary Global Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 3.3.
 
Upon any exchange of a portion of any such Global Security, the Trustee or any such Authenticating Agent or the Depositary, as the case may be, shall indicate upon such temporary Global Security, the amount of such exchange to reflect the reduction of the principal amount evidenced thereby, whereupon its remaining principal amount shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged. Until so exchanged in full, such temporary Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 3.5     Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
With respect to the Registered Securities, the Company shall keep or cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. Such register is herein sometimes referred to as the "Securities Register." The Trustee is hereby appointed "Securities Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company designated for that purpose the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, of the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms.
At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, of the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Registered Securities may not be exchanged for Bearer Securities. Bearer Securities may not be exchanged for Bearer Securities of other authorized denominations.
All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Securities Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar for such series, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
Unless otherwise provided in the Securities to be transferred or exchanged, no service charge shall be made to a Holder for any transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company (unless otherwise provided in such Securities) may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Securities other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any transfer.
 
If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, neither the Company nor any Securities Registrar shall be required (i) to issue, register the transfer or exchange of any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of such Securities selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on (A) if Securities of the series are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption of Registered Securities of such series so selected for redemption, or (B) if Securities of the series are issued as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange of any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged, in whole or in part, for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security, in whole or in part, may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as depositary, in each case unless the Company has approved a successor Depositary within 90 days, (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security, (C) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security will be so exchangeable or transferable or (D) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 3.1.
(3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 3.4, 3.6, 9.6 or 11.7 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
 
Section 3.6     Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same issue and series of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same issue and series of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity as such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series, with its coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.7     Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security of any series which is payable or deliverable, and is punctually paid, delivered or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, shall be paid or delivered to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest in respect of Securities of such series, except that, unless otherwise provided in the Securities of such series, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of the principal of a Security shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid.
 
Any interest on any Registered Security of any series which is payable, but is not timely paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series (herein called "Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series in respect of which interest is in default (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money or other property equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment or delivery, such money or property when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment or delivery of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment or delivery and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment or delivery. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment or delivery of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class, postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Security of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Securities Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment or delivery of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2). In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business at such office or agency on any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date of payment or delivery of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such proposed date for payment or delivery and Defaulted Interest will not be payable or deliverable on such proposed date for payment or delivery in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of the series in respect of which interest is in default
 
may be listed or traded and, upon such notice as may be required by such exchange (or by the Trustee if the Securities are not listed), if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Subject to the provisions of Section 14.2, in the case of any Security (or any part thereof) which is converted after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Security the principal of (or premium, if any, on) which shall become due and payable, whether at Stated Maturity or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest whose Stated Maturity is on such Interest Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or any one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence or in Section 14.2, in the case of any Security (or any part thereof) which is converted, interest whose Stated Maturity is after the date of conversion of such Security (or such part thereof) shall not be payable.
Section 3.8     Persons Deemed Owners.
Title to any Bearer Security, any coupons appertaining thereto and any temporary Global Security in bearer form shall pass by delivery.
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer of any Registered Security, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to Section 3.7) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any coupon, as the case may be, as the absolute owner of such Security or coupon for the purposes of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever whether or not such Security or coupon is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 3.9     Cancellation.
All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and coupons and Securities and coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly canceled
 
by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities and coupons so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities and coupons shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures and the Trustee shall deliver to the Company upon request a certificate of such disposal.
Section 3.10     Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series for any period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and interest on the Securities of each series for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 3.11     CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers and/or other similar numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" and/or other similar numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that, any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" and/or other numbers.
Section 4.1     Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for and as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1) and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
(1) either
(A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities surrendered for exchange for Registered Securities and maturing after such exchange, whose surrender is not required or has been waived, (ii) coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities call for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date, whose surrender has been waived, (iii) Securities and coupons which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.6 and (iv) Securities
 
for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.3) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation:
(i) have become due and payable, or
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year of the date of deposit, or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
and the Company, in the case of Clause (B) (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose an amount in the currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities and coupons not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.7, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.2 and the last paragraph of Section 10.3 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge. The Trustee may give notice to the Holders or Securities Outstanding of the immediate availability of the amount referred to in Clause (1) above.
In the event there are Securities of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Securities of all series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. The effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of such instruments from the Trustee.
 
Section 4.2     Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.3, all money or property deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 and Article XIII shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for the payment of which such money or obligations have been deposited with or received by the Trustee.
Section 5.1     Events of Default.
"Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to the Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), unless in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture or Officers' Certificate establishing such series, it is provided that such series shall not have the benefit of said Event of Default:
(1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series, when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of that series at its Maturity; or
(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or
(4) default in the performance, or breach, in any material respect, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in the performance of which or the breach of which is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series affected thereby (voting together as a single class) a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
(5) the entry of a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or
 
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property or ordering the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
(6) the institution by the Company of proceedings to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or the consent by it to the filing of any such petition or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit for creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due and its willingness to be adjudicated a bankrupt, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or
(7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series in the Board Resolutions, supplemental indenture or Officers' Certificate establishing that series.
Section 5.2     Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
Unless the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture or Officers' Certificate establishing such series provides otherwise, if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(5) or 5.1(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case, except for any series of Securities the principal of which shall have already become due and payable, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all affected series then Outstanding (voting together as a single class) may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all the Securities of the affected series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders) and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified portion thereof) of and the accrued interest on all the Securities of such affected series shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(5) or 5.1(6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms of that series) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. Any payment by the Company on the Securities following any such acceleration will be subject to the subordination provisions of Article XV to the extent provided therein.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all affected series then Outstanding (voting together a single class), by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A) all overdue installments of interest on all Securities of that series,
 
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Securities,
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities; and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.3     Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company covenants that if:
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay or deliver to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable or deliverable on such Securities for principal, including any sinking fund payment or analogous obligations (and premium, if any) and interest; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem necessary to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 5.4     Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors,
(a) the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal (and premium, if any) or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amounts as may be due and payable pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 6.2 and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect to the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable and to take any and all actions as are authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have the claims of the Holders and any predecessor to the Trustee under Section 6.7 allowed in any such judicial proceedings; and
(ii) in particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 5.6; and
(b) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments or deliveries to the Trustee for distribution in accordance with Section 5.6, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.7.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee.
 
Section 5.5     Trustee May Enforce Claim Without Possession of Securities.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities or any series or coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of all the amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.7, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Section 5.6     Application of Money Collected.
Any money or property collected or to be applied by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities pursuant to this Article, after reserving therefrom by the Trustee an amount sufficient, in the determination of the Trustee, to cover the expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee that may be incurred thereafter, shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money or property on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any predecessor Trustee, its agents and counsel under Section 6.7;
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon such series of Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such series of Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and
THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company.
Section 5.7     Limitation on Suits.
No Holder of any Securities of any series or any related coupons shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all affected series then Outstanding (voting together as a single class) shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
 
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.12;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing itself of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
Section 5.8     Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on such Security or payment on such coupon on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) to convert such Securities in accordance with Article XIV to the extent that such right to convert is applicable to such Security, and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Section 5.9     Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 5.10     Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided in the last paragraph of Section 3.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
Section 5.11     Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee, any Holder of any Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee (subject to the limitations contained in this Indenture) or by the Holders, as the case may be.
Section 5.12     Control by Holders.
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all affected series (voting together as a single class) at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that:
(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and the Trustee shall not have determined that the action so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to Holders of Securities of that series, or any other series, not taking part in such direction,
(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and
(3) subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction if a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee shall, in good faith, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or would otherwise be contrary to applicable law.
Section 5.13     Waiver of Past Defaults.
Subject to Section 5.2, the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series as to which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (voting together as a single class) may, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such affected series, waive any past default hereunder and its consequences with respect to such series except:
(1) a default in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series,
(2) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected, or
 
(3) to the extent such right is applicable to such Security, a failure by the Company on request to convert any Security into Common Stock.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.14     Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided that, neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require any such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company or in any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Security in accordance with Article XIV.
This Section 5.14 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security.
Section 5.15     Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws.
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Section 6.1     Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to a series of Securities,
(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and only with respect to series of Securities as to which it is the Trustee, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
 
(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture, but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as to a series of Securities as to which it is Trustee, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct except that:
(1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of Holders pursuant to Section 5.12 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series.
(d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
Section 6.2     Notice of Defaults.
Within 90 days after actual knowledge by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear in the Securities Register, notice of such default, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, the Trustee shall be fully protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a committee of Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of Securities of such series; and provided, further, that, in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 5.1(4), no such notice to Holders of Securities of such series shall be given until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series.
 
Section 6.3     Certain Rights of Trustee.
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1:
(a) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, Security, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

(d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, indenture, Security or other paper or document, but the Trustee in its discretion may make such inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney;
 
(g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;

(i) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or be charged with knowledge of any default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities for which it is acting as Trustee unless written notice of such default or Event of Default, as the case may be, is received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee from the Company, any other obligor upon such Securities or by any Holder of such Securities, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture;
(j) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder;
(k) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any persons authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded; and
(l) in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
Section 6.4     Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of the Securities or the proceeds thereof.

The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Securities Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Securities Registrar or such other agent.
 
Subject to the limitations imposed by the Trust Indenture Act, nothing in this Indenture shall prohibit the Trustee from becoming and acting as trustee under other indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest of participation in other securities, of the Company are outstanding in the same manner as if it were not Trustee hereunder.
Section 6.6     Money Held in Trust.
Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money or other property received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company.
Section 6.7     Compensation and Reimbursement.
The Company agrees:
(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time compensation for all services rendered by it, as may be applicable, hereunder in such amounts as the Company and the Trustee shall agree in writing from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by it in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel not regularly in its employ), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as shall be caused by its own negligence or bad faith; and
(3) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify each of the Trustee, and any predecessor trustee and their agents, for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, tax, penalty, claim, damage or expense (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred without negligence or bad faith, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust or the performance of their duties hereunder, including the enforcement of this provision and the costs and expenses of defending themselves against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder. This indemnification shall survive the termination of this Indenture. This Section 6.7 shall survive the termination of this Indenture or the earlier resignation or removal of the Trustee.
To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Company and the Holders agree that the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee except funds held in trust for the benefit of Holders of particular Securities. Such lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
In addition to and without prejudice to its rights hereunder, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar law.
 
"Trustee" for the purposes of this Section shall include any predecessor Trustee; provided, however, that the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Trustee hereunder shall not affect the rights of any other Trustee hereunder.
Section 6.8     Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture.
Section 6.9     Type of Trustee Required; Eligibility.
There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for the Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a corporation that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has (or if the Trustee is a member of a bank holding company system, its bank holding company has) a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such corporation or bank holding company publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation or bank holding company shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. Neither the Company nor any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Company shall serve as Trustee for the Securities of any series issued hereunder.
Section 6.10     Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 6.11.
(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition at the expense of the Company any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all affected series then Outstanding (acting together as a single class), delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
(d) If at any time:
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.8 with respect to a series of Securities after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.9 with respect to a series of Securities and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (i) the Company, acting pursuant to the authority of a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities or (ii) subject to Section 5.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, subject to Section 5.14, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of Securities of such series as their names and addresses appear in the Securities Register. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
Section 6.11     Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to any series of Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
 
effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject, nevertheless, to its lien provided for in Section 6.7.
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts, and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, subject, nevertheless, to its lien provided for in Section 6.7.
(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
Section 6.12     Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of
 
the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated, and in case any Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities in the name of such successor Trustee, and in all cases the certificate of authentication shall have the full force which it is provided anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
Section 6.13     Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
Section 6.14     Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent shall be the successor Authenticating Agent hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
 
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 1.6 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Securities referred to in the within mentioned Indenture.

The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of Trust Indenture Act Section 314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of same shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificate).
 
Section 7.5     Statement by Officers as to Default.

Section 8.1     Company May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain Terms.
Subject to Section 3.1, the Company covenants that it will not merge or consolidate with any other Person or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets to any other Person, unless (i) either (a) the Company shall be the continuing corporation or (b) the successor Person, in any merger or consolidation (if other than the Company), or the Person which acquires by sale, lease or conveyance substantially all the assets of the Company, shall be a corporation and validly existing under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all the Securities, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed or observed by the Company, by supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by such Person and (ii) the Company, such successor entity or such Person, as the case may be, shall not, immediately after such merger or consolidation, or such sale, lease or conveyance, be in default in the performance of any such covenant or condition.

Upon any consolidation or merger by the Company with or into any other Person, or any conveyance, transfer or lease by the Company of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person in accordance with Section 8.1, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein.
Such successor Person may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company prior to such succession, any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor Person instead of the Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the

All the Securities so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease, such changes in phraseology and form may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.

A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture that has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

Unless otherwise provided in a supplemental indenture or pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof, the Place of Payment of any series of Securities shall be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all of such purposes, and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and any change in the location of any such office or agency.
With respect to any Global Security, and except as otherwise may be specified for such Global Security as contemplated by Section 3.1, the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee shall be the Place of Payment where such Global Security may be presented or surrendered for payment or for registration of transfer or exchange, or where successor Securities may be delivered in exchange therefor, provided, however, that any such payment, presentation, surrender or delivery effected pursuant to the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary for such Global Security shall be deemed to have been effected at the Place of Payment for such Global Security in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
Section 10.3     Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust.
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its failure so to act.
 
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on any Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal and premium (if any) or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest;
(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent; and
(4) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for a period ending on the earlier of the date that is ten Business Days prior to the date such money would escheat to the State or two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall (unless otherwise required by mandatory provision of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law) be paid on Company Request to the Company, or (if then held by the Company) shall (unless otherwise required by mandatory provision of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law) be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees and agents or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon
 
cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. In the absence of a written request from the Company to return unclaimed funds to the Company, the Trustee shall from time to time deliver all unclaimed funds to or as directed by applicable escheat authorities, as determined by the Trustee in its sole discretion, in accordance with the customary practices and procedures of the Trustee. Any unclaimed funds held by the Trustee pursuant to this Section shall be held uninvested and without any liability for interest.
Section 10.4     Statement as to Compliance.
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each calendar year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate covering the preceding calendar year, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of or compliance with any of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Indenture, and if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. For the purpose of this Section 10.4, compliance shall be determined without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice provided pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
Section 10.5     Waiver of Certain Covenants.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of such series, the Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any covenant or condition provided pursuant to Section 3.1(l), 9.1(3), 9.1(4) and 9.1(7) with respect to the Securities of any series, if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series affected by such waiver (voting together as a single class) either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
Section 10.6     Corporate Existence.
Subject to Article VIII, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and its rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of its business and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
 
Section 10.7     Appointment to Fill a Vacancy in Office of Trustee.
The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of the Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 6.10, a Trustee so that there shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to each series of Securities hereunder.
Section 11.1     Applicability of this Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity. Redemption of Securities of any series (whether by operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) as permitted or required by any form of Security issued pursuant to this Indenture shall be made in accordance with such form of Security and this Article; provided, however, that if any provision of any such form of Security shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the provision of such form of Security shall govern.
Section 11.2     Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities redeemed at the option of the Company shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of any Securities of a series, the Company shall, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such date and of the principal amount of Securities of that series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel evidencing compliance with such restriction.
Section 11.3     Selection of Securities to be Redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination; provided that, Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part, but only in integral multiples of $1,000) for such Security, or, in the case of Bearer Securities, equal to $1,000 or $5,000. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.
 
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Securities Registrar in writing of the Securities selected for partial redemption and the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before the termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities that have been converted during a selection of Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for purposes of such selection.
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct, Securities registered in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any Subsidiary thereof shall not be included in the Securities selected for redemption.
Section 11.4     Notice of Redemption.
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than the 30th day, and not earlier than the 60th day, prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Securities Register or, in the case of Bearer Securities, the manner provided in Section 1.6.
With respect to Securities of each series to be redeemed, each notice of redemption shall state:
(a) the Redemption Date;
(b) the Redemption Price;
(c) if less than all Outstanding Securities of such particular series and having the same terms are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
(d) that on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, and, accrued interest, if any, will become due and payable upon each such Security or portion thereof, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date;
 
(e) in the case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the Holder will receive, without charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed;
(f) the conversion price, the date on which the right to convert the principal of the Securities to be redeemed will terminate and the place or places where such Securities may be surrendered for conversion;
(g) the place or places where such Securities, together in the case of Bearer Securities with all remaining coupons appertaining thereto, if any, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
(h) the CUSIP and/or other similar numbers as contemplated by Section 3.11; and
(i) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request delivered at least ten days prior to the date such notice is to be given (unless a shorter period shall be acceptable to the Trustee, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld), by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security.
Section 11.5     Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in Section 11.4, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and any accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date, other than any Securities called for redemption on that date that have been converted prior to the date of such deposit.
If any Security called for redemption is converted, any money deposited with the Trustee or with any Paying Agent or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security shall (subject to the right of the Holder of such Security or any Predecessor Security to receive interest as provided in the last paragraph of Section 3.7) be paid to the Company upon the Company Request or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust.
 
Section 11.6     Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
If any notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 11.4, the Securities or portion of Securities with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable Redemption Price and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Securities shall cease to bear interest and the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a Place of Payment in said notice specified, the said securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only at an office or agency as specified in the Security and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, only upon presentation and surrender of coupons for such interest. Installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7.
If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or to the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter, the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted from the Company; provided, however, that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal of and premium, if any, on such Security shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
Section 11.7     Securities Redeemed in Part.
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and such Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge to the Holder, a new Security or Securities of the same Series and Stated Maturity, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security surrendered. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Security will also be a new Global Security.
 
Section 12.1   Applicability of Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any sinking fund payment in excess of such minimum amount which is permitted to be made by the terms of such Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
Section 12.2   Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) together, in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series, with all unmatured coupons appertaining thereto and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series that has been converted pursuant to Article XIV or that have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; provided that, the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price for such Securities, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 12.3   Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.1) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 12.2 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Such Officers' Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such Officers' Certificate (or, as required by this Indenture, the Securities and coupons, if any,
 
specified in such Officers' Certificate), the sinking fund payment due on the succeeding sinking fund payment date for such series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of the Securities of such series subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the right to deliver or credit securities as provided in Section 12.2 and without the right to make the optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series at such time.
Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made with respect to the Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date immediately following the date of such payment) to the redemption of Securities of such series at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities with respect to the sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust by the Company as provided in Section 10.3) for such series and together with such payment (or such amount so segregated) shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.3. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 10.3) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Securities of such series at Maturity. The Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.3 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.6 and 11.7. On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) in cash a sum in the currency in which Securities of such series are payable (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.1) equal to the principal and any interest accrued to the Redemption Date for Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section 12.3.
Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall redeem any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on any Securities of such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to the Securities of such series, except that if the notice of redemption shall have been provided in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee (or the Company, if the Company is then acting as its own Paying Agent) shall redeem such Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article XII. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security
 
for the payment of the Securities and coupons, if any, of such series; provided, however, that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for the Securities of such series on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section 12.3.
Section 13.1   Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have Section 13.2 or Section 13.3 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, designated pursuant to Section 3.1 as being defeasible pursuant to such Section 13.2 or 13.3, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 3.1 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article. Any such election shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities.
Section 13.2   Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 13.4 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
(1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 13.4 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due,
(2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 10.2 and 10.3, and, if applicable, Article XIV,
(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, and
(4) this Article.
Subject to compliance with this Article, the Company may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 13.3 applied to such Securities.
 
Section 13.3   Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be,
(1) the Company shall be released from any covenants provided pursuant to Sections 3.1(l), 9.1(3), 9.1(4) or 9.1(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, as the case may be, and
(2) the occurrence of any event specified in Section 5.1(4) (with respect to any of Sections 10.6 and 10.7 and any such covenants provided pursuant to Sections 3.1(l), 9.1(3), 9.1(4) or 9.1(7)) and the occurrence of any other Event of Default specified pursuant to Section 3.1 shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default,
in each case with respect to such Securities or series of Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 13.4 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 5.1(4) and the occurrence of any Event of Default specified pursuant to Section 3.1), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
Section 13.4   Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 13.2 or Section 13.3 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be:

(A) in the case of Securities of a series denominated in currency of the United States,
(i) cash in currency of the United States in an amount, or

(iii) a combination thereof,
in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities.
(2) In the event of an election to have Section 13.2 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that:
(A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or
(B) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law,

(4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit.
 
(5) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 5.1(5) and (6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day).
(6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act).
(7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.
(8) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder.

Section 13.6   Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 13.2 or 13.3 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 13.5 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.
Section 14.1   Applicability of Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are convertible into shares of Common Stock of the Company, and the issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of such Securities, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for the Securities of such series.
Section 14.2   Exercise of Conversion Privilege.
In order to exercise a conversion privilege, the Holder of a Security of a series with such a privilege shall surrender such Security to the Company at the office or agency maintained for that purpose pursuant to Section 10.2, accompanied by a duly executed conversion notice to the Company substantially in the form set forth in Section 2.5 stating that the Holder elects to convert such Security or a specified portion thereof. Such notice shall also state, if different from the name and address of such Holder, the name or names (with address) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock, which shall be issuable on such conversion, shall be issued. Securities surrendered for conversion shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by or accompanied by instruments of transfer in forms satisfactory to the Company duly executed by the Holder or its attorney duly authorized in writing; and Securities so surrendered for conversion (in whole or in part) during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (excluding Securities or portions thereof called for redemption during the period beginning at the close of business on a Regular Record Date and ending at the opening of business on the first Business Day after the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or if such Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, the second such Business Day) shall also be accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of such Security then being converted, and such interest shall be payable to such Holder notwithstanding the conversion of such Security, subject to the provisions of Section 3.7 relating to the payment of Defaulted
 
Interest by the Company. As promptly as practicable after the receipt of such notice and of any payment required pursuant to a Board Resolution and, subject to Section 3.3, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in an Officers' Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of such series of Security, and the surrender of such Security in accordance with such reasonable regulations as the Company may prescribe, the Company shall issue and shall deliver, at the office or agency at which such Security is surrendered, to such Holder or on its written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such Security (or specified portion thereof), in accordance with the provisions of such Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture, and cash as provided therein in respect of any fractional share of such Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which such notice and such payment, if required, shall have been received in proper order for conversion by the Company and such Security shall have been surrendered as aforesaid (unless such Holder shall have so surrendered such Security and shall have instructed the Company to effect the conversion on a particular date following such surrender and such Holder shall be entitled to convert such Security on such date, in which case such conversion shall be deemed to be effected immediately prior to the close of business on such date) and at such time the rights of the Holder of such Security as such Security Holder shall cease and the person or persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the Holder or Holders of record of the shares represented thereby. Except as set forth above and subject to the final paragraph of Section 3.7, no payment or adjustment shall be made upon any conversion on account of any interest accrued on the Securities (or any part thereof) surrendered for conversion or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock of the Company issued upon such conversion. In the case of any Security which is converted in part only, upon such conversion the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of such Security.
Section 14.3   No Fractional Shares.
No fractional share of Common Stock of the Company shall be issued upon conversions of Securities of any series. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. If, except for the provisions of this Section 14.3, any Holder of a Security or Securities would be entitled to a fractional share of Common Stock of the Company upon the conversion of such Security or Securities, or specified portions thereof, the Company shall pay to such Holder an amount in cash equal to the current market value of such fractional share computed, (i) if such Common Stock is listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange or market, on the basis of the last reported sale price regular way on such exchange or market on the last trading day prior to the date of conversion upon which such a sale shall have been effected, or (ii) if such Common Stock is not at the time so listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange or market, on the basis of the average of the
 
bid and asked prices of such Common Stock in the over-the-counter market, on the last trading day prior to the date of conversion, as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated or similar organization if the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated is no longer reporting such information, or if not so available, the fair market price as determined by the Board of Directors. For purposes of this Section, "trading day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday other than any day on which the Common Stock is not traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or if the Common Stock is not traded on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal exchange or market on which the Common Stock is traded or quoted.

The conversion price of Securities of any series that is convertible into Common Stock of the Company shall be adjusted for any stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications, combinations or similar transactions in accordance with the terms of the supplemental indenture or Board Resolutions setting forth the terms of the Securities of such series. Whenever the conversion price is adjusted, the Company shall compute the adjusted conversion price in accordance with terms of the applicable Board Resolution or supplemental indenture and shall prepare an Officers' Certificate setting forth the adjusted conversion price and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall forthwith be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of Securities pursuant to Section 10.2 and, if different, with the Trustee. The Company shall forthwith cause a notice setting forth the adjusted conversion price to be mailed, first-class, postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at its address appearing on the Securities Register and to any conversion agent other than the Trustee.
Section 14.5   Notice of Certain Corporate Actions.
In case:
(1) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock payable otherwise than in cash out of its retained earnings (other than a dividend for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required) that would require an adjustment pursuant to Section 14.4; or
(2) the Company shall authorize the granting to all or substantially all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any other rights (other than any such grant for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required); or

(4) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
 
then the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee, and shall cause to be mailed to all Holders at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Securities Register, at least 20 days (or 10 days in any case specified in Clause (1) or (2) above) prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, rights, options or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights, options or warrants are to be determined, or (ii) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, share exchange, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. If at any time the Trustee shall not be the conversion agent, a copy of such notice shall also forthwith be filed by the Company with the Trustee.

Section 14.7   Payment of Certain Taxes upon Conversion.
Except as provided in the next sentence, the Company will pay any and all taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of its Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of its Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security or Securities to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.
Section 14.8   Nonassessability.
The Company covenants that all shares of its Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of Securities will upon issue in accordance with the terms hereof be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable.
Section 14.9   Provision in Case of Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets.
In case of any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other Person, any merger of another Person with or into the Company (other than a merger which does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company) or any conveyance, sale, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Person formed by such consolidation or resulting from such merger or which acquires such assets, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee
 
a supplemental indenture providing that the Holder of each Security of a series then Outstanding that is convertible into Common Stock of the Company shall have the right thereafter (which right shall be the exclusive conversion right thereafter available to said Holder), during the period such Security shall be convertible, to convert such Security only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into which such Security might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease, assuming such holder of Common Stock of the Company (i) is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or merged with or into or which merged into or with the Company or to which such conveyance, sale, transfer or lease was made, as the case may be (a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person and (ii) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer, or lease is not the same for each share of Common Stock of the Company held immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease by others than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-electing Share"), then for the purpose of this Section 14.9 the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease by the holders of each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental indenture, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article or in accordance with the terms of the supplemental indenture or Board Resolutions setting forth the terms of such adjustments. The above provisions of this Section 14.9 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, conveyances, sales, transfers or leases. Notice of the execution of such a supplemental indenture shall be given by the Company to the Holder of each Security of a series that is convertible into Common Stock of the Company as provided in Section 1.6 promptly upon such execution. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent, if any, shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any such supplemental indenture relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or other securities or property or cash receivable by Holders of Securities of a series convertible into Common Stock of the Company upon the conversion of their Securities after any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, sale or lease or to any such adjustment, but may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel with respect thereto, which the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Trustee.
Section 14.10   Duties of Trustee Regarding Conversion.
Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities of any series that is convertible into Common Stock of the Company to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the conversion price, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, whether herein or in any supplemental indenture, any resolutions of the Board of Directors or written instrument executed by one or more officers of
 
the Company provided to be employed in making the same. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock of the Company, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Securities and neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent makes any representation with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of its Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article XIV or in the applicable supplemental indenture, resolutions of the Board of Directors or written instrument executed by one or more duly authorized officers of the Company.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed, all as of the day and year first above written.
