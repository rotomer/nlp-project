Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
The Company has been responding to civil litigation claims and regulatory investigations regarding two fixed income mutual funds, the Schwab YieldPlus Fund(R) and the Schwab Total Bond Market Fund(TM). On October 14, 2009, the Company received a Wells notice from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the staff intends to recommend the filing of a civil enforcement action against Schwab Investments, Charles Schwab Investment Management, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. and the president of the funds for possible violations of the securities laws with respect to the two funds. A Wells notice provides recipients an opportunity to respond to issues raised in the staff's investigation prior to any decision on an enforcement proceeding by the Commission, and is neither a formal allegation nor a finding of wrongdoing. The Company intends to respond to the notice to explain why it believes enforcement charges are unwarranted.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
