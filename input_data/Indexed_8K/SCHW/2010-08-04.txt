required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Prospectus (the term Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 9 being deemed to include any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements to the foregoing), in any Covered Free Writing Prospectus, in any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) of the Company, which "issuer information" is required to be, or is, filed with the Commission, or in any Prospectus together with any combination of one or more of the Covered Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, with respect to such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, a Prospectus or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "") is brought against a person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or an Underwriter (as applicable, the "") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
 
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.

Transaction Agreements
In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the legal capacity of individuals, that the signatures on all documents not executed in our presence are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, that all documents submitted to us as reproduced or certified copies conform to the original documents, that all Company Contracts filed with the Commission conform to the original documents, that all corporate records of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries provided to us for review are accurate and complete, and that any reviews and searches of public records obtained by us are accurate and complete. We have further assumed that each of the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company is duly qualified to engage in the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; that the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of, each of the parties thereto other than the Company, and are enforceable against the parties thereto other than the Company in accordance with their respective terms; that the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company have the requisite power and authority to perform their respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements executed and delivered by them; and that there are no documents, agreements or understandings among or between any parties to the Transaction Agreements or others that would modify the respective rights and obligations of such parties as set forth in the Transaction Agreements or that otherwise would have an effect on the opinions rendered below.
As to matters of fact material to our opinions, we have relied solely upon our review of the documents referred to in the second paragraph of this letter, and upon oral advice from the staff of the Commission. We have assumed that the recitals of fact and the
 
representations and warranties of all parties as to factual matters set forth in the documents referred to above are true, complete and correct on the date hereof. We have not independently verified any factual matters or the validity of any assumptions made by us in this letter, and we express no opinion or belief, and disclaim any implication or inference, as to the reasonableness of any such assumption.
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have considered only Applicable Laws (as defined herein). "" means the Delaware General Corporation Law and those laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the United States of America and the State of California presently in effect that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Without suggesting that any of the following might otherwise be applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, "Applicable Laws" specifically does not include, among other laws, the following "": any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, decisions or administrative interpretations (a) of any county, locality or municipality, (b) pertaining to taxes; securities (except the Securities Act for purposes of paragraphs 5 through 9 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 11 below, the Trust Indenture Act for purposes of paragraph 10 below, and the Investment Company Act for purposes of paragraph 11 below); the regulation of banks, thrifts, savings and loan associations or any similar entity that is engaged in the business of lending as one of its principal business activities, or holding companies of any of the foregoing; labor, employee or management relations; money laundering; privacy; environment; health and safety; trade regulation; franchising; antitrust; intellectual property; unfair competition; or pension, retirement, deferred compensation or any other employee benefits, including ERISA, (c) relating to choice of law or conflicts of law and/or (d) to which the transactions are or may be subject because of the legal or regulatory status of any person other than the Company or because of any facts pertaining to any such person. Although Excluded Laws may apply to the Transaction Agreements (or performance under any of them), we express no opinion with respect to the effect of Excluded Laws on the matters involved in the opinions set forth herein.
Applicable Laws
Excluded Laws
Whenever a statement or opinion herein is qualified by the phrase "known to us," "to our knowledge," "of which we are aware," or any similar phrase, we intend to indicate that during the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to the attention of those attorneys currently employed by this law firm who have rendered legal services to the Company in connection with substantive legal matters that would give such attorneys actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statements or opinions. We have not undertaken or conducted any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of statements or opinions herein qualified as described in the preceding sentence, and any limited inquiry undertaken by us during the preparation of this opinion letter should not be regarded as such an investigation; no inference as to our knowledge of any matters bearing on the accuracy of any such statement or opinion should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company. Further, we call to your attention that the Company is a holding company for, and therefore engages directly or indirectly in, multi-faceted and complex businesses, and that we have not represented the Company in connection with all of its business activities. Accordingly, our actual knowledge typically does not extend to or encompass any matter or issue as to which we have not advised the Company.
 
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following:
(i) The factual basis for our opinions in paragraph 1 below is based solely on our review of the Charters, the Minute Books, the Good Standing Certificates and the Officers' Certificates;
(ii) Our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d) below are based solely upon an examination of the Company Contracts. We have made no further investigation. With regard to the Company Contracts, we have assumed with respect to each Company Contract that such Company Contract would be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and that it is governed by the substantive laws of the State of California (without regard to conflicts-of-law and choice-of-law principles), even though the terms of such Company Contract may provide that the law of a jurisdiction other than California is the governing law of such Company Contract. We express no opinion as to any statement or writing that may constitute parol evidence bearing on interpretation or construction of any Company Contract. Further, to the extent that any of the Company Contracts contain any financial covenants, provisions relating to the occurrence of a "material adverse effect" or similar provisions, for purposes of our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d) below, we have relied solely on the Officers' Certificates as to (i) the Company's compliance with any and all such financial covenants and provisions, and (ii) the conclusion that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture do not, under any such financial covenants or provisions, constitute a default or result in the imposition of a lien or encumbrance, and we have undertaken no investigation or analysis, nor conducted any financial computations, with respect thereto;
(iii) Our opinion in the first sentence of paragraph 6 below is based solely upon oral advice from the staff of the Commission;
(iv) We have assumed that the Securities have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee;
(v) Except to the limited extent set forth in paragraphs 8 and 9 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 11 below, we express no opinion whatsoever as to the compliance or noncompliance by any person with antifraud or information delivery provisions of state or federal laws, rules and regulations;
(vi) We express no opinion or view as to any statement superseded or modified or deemed to be superseded or modified pursuant to Rule 412 under the Securities Act; and
(vii) We express no opinion regarding the rights or remedies available to any party for material violations or breaches that are the proximate result of actions taken by any party other than the party against whom enforcement is sought.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Company, Holdings and CSIM is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. CS & Co. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California. The Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the State of California. CS & Co. is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington.
2. Each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries has the corporate power and corporate authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement. The Company's execution, delivery and performance of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Board of Directors of the Company.
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under each of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture on the date hereof in accordance with their respective terms and the issuance and sale of the Securities do not (a) violate the Charters or the Bylaws, (b) violate any judgment, writ, decree or order of any court to which the Company is named as a party and of which we are aware, (c) constitute a default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary under any Company Contract, or (d) result in the imposition of a lien or encumbrance on any material properties of the Company or of any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to any Company Contract. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Indenture on the date hereof in accordance with their respective terms, do not violate any Applicable Law, , , that the foregoing opinion, insofar as it pertains to performance, is subject to the same limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth in paragraph 4 below.
provided
however
4. Each of the Transaction Agreements has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. Upon payment in full for and delivery of the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, each of the Indenture and the Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, in each case except as the validity, binding nature or enforceability of the same may be limited by:
(a) applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, and other laws or court decisions relating to or affecting the rights of creditors;
 
(b) equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, equitable subordination, and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law or whether codified by statute;
(c) California judicial decisions which have held that certain provisions of agreements are unenforceable under circumstances where it cannot be demonstrated that the enforcement of such provisions is reasonably necessary for the protection of the party seeking enforcement, has been undertaken in good faith under the circumstances then existing and is commercially reasonable;

8. The statements contained in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Description of the Notes," and the statements contained in the Basic Prospectus under the caption "Description of Debt Securities of The Charles Schwab Corporation," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of documents referred to therein or summaries of matters of law, constitute in all material respects accurate summaries of such terms or matters, as the case may be.
9. To our knowledge, there are no contracts or documents required under the Securities Act (i) to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein which have not been so filed or incorporated by reference as required, or (ii) to be described in the Registration Statement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus) which have not been so described as required.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President and Associate General Counsel of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated July 19, 2010 (the "Agreement"), by and among you and the Company regarding the purchase by you of $600,000,000 4.45% Senior Notes due 2020 of The Charles Schwab Corporation. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, have the same meanings given them in the Agreement.
I have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-156152) (the "Registration Statement"), the Prospectus Supplement, the Disclosure Package, the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 and the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on January 21, 2010, February 2, 2010, March 16, 2010, and May 18, 2010. In addition, I have examined the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab"), Schwab Holdings, Inc. ("Schwab Holdings"), Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. ("CSIM"), and Charles Schwab Bank ("Schwab Bank"), and such corporate records, certificates and other documents (of which I am aware) and such questions of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering the opinions that follow.
In giving the opinions that follow I have relied as to matters of fact without investigation, to the extent I deemed proper, upon certificates from officers of the Company and certain of its
 
affiliates, and certificates, telegrams, facsimiles, and other documents from, and oral conversations with, public officials. I have assumed without investigation the authenticity of each document submitted to me as an original, the conformity to the originals of each document submitted to me as a copy, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. Schwab Bank is a federal savings bank under the supervision of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
2. Each of Schwab, Schwab Holdings, Schwab Bank and CSIM is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualifications, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and
3. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and are not so described.
This opinion is dated as of July 22, 2010 ("Opinion Date"). The opinions expressed herein are given as of the Opinion Date only, and are not given as of any later date. I have not undertaken any factual or legal investigation beyond the Opinion Date, and I disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person after the Opinion Date if any change in fact and/or law should change my opinion with respect to any matters set forth herein.
I am a member of the bar of the State of California. I express no opinion as to any laws of any other jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States to the extent applicable to the scope of the opinions expressed above. Further, I express no opinion regarding choice of law or conflicts of laws.
This opinion is rendered to you as Underwriters under the Agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my express written consent.
 
 
I, Joseph R. Martinetto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""), on behalf of the Company, do hereby certify pursuant to Section 6(h) of that certain Underwriting Agreement dated July 19, 2010 (the "") among the Company and, on behalf of the several Underwriters named therein, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., that as of July 22, 2010:
