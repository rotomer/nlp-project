Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
As disclosed previously, The Charles Schwab Corporation (the Company) has been responding to consolidated class action litigation filed between March and May 2008, relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund, an ultra-short bond fund. On April 23, 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs, and without admitting liability, agreed to a total of $200 million to resolve plaintiffs' federal law claims. On May 14, 2010, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs, and without admitting liability, agreed to resolve plaintiffs' state law claim for $35 million. The settlement agreements were preliminarily approved by the court on May 26, 2010, and remain subject to final court approval. On October 14, 2010, the court issued an opinion interpreting the proposed settlement terms and holding that federal securities law class members resident outside of California would not be precluded under the proposed settlement agreements from bringing further claims under California law against the defendants.
On November 8, 2010, defendants notified plaintiffs that defendants are invoking the termination provisions of the settlement agreements in those actions. Defendants have also filed with the court a notice of withdrawal from the original motions filed jointly by plaintiffs and defendants for final approval of the settlements. At this time, plaintiffs continue to support the original motions for final approval, which remain pending and subject to further proceedings.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
