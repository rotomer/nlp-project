Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
As disclosed previously, The Charles Schwab Corporation (the Company) has been responding to consolidated class action litigation relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund, an ultra-short bond fund. Earlier this year, the Company and other defendants entered into preliminary settlement agreements with plaintiffs, and without admitting liability, agreed to a total of $235 million to resolve plaintiffs' federal and state law claims. On November 8, 2010, defendants notified plaintiffs that defendants were invoking the termination provisions of the settlement agreements in those actions after the court issued an opinion holding that the proposed settlement terms would not preclude certain class members resident outside of California from bringing certain additional claims against the defendants.
On November 24, 2010, the court preliminarily approved an amendment to the original settlement agreements, subject to a final fairness hearing on February 11, 2011. The amendment preserves the original settlements but releases defendants from any further claims those class members could assert and provides those class members an opportunity to opt-out of the settlements and pursue separate claims. The Company's total settlement liability will be reduced by the amounts that opting-out class members would have otherwise received under the settlements.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
