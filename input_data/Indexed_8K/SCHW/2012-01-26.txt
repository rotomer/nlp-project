If the sale to the Underwriters of the Securities, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this Agreement, or if such sale is not carried out because the Company shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(o), 5 and 9 hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof) or to one another hereunder.
8. . Subject to Sections 6 and 7 hereof, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Securities to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6 hereof or a reason sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Section 7 hereof) and if the aggregate principal amount of Securities which all Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total aggregate principal amount of Securities, the non-defaulting Underwriters (including the Underwriters, if any, substituted in the manner set forth below) shall take up and pay for (in addition to the principal amount of Securities they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the principal amount of Securities agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such Securities shall be taken up and paid for by such non-defaulting Underwriters in such amount or amounts as you may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in the event no such designation is made, such Securities shall be taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters in .

Schedule A
Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Securities hereunder unless all of the Securities are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by you with the approval of the Company or selected by the Company with your approval).
If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or by the Company for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Company or you shall have the right to postpone the Time of Purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and other documents may be effected.
The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in hereto.
Schedule A
 
If the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total aggregate principal amount of Securities which all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Company shall make arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase of all the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of the Company to any Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter to the Company. Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers, and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any "affiliate" that sells Shares on behalf of such Underwriters, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in the Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Prospectus (the term Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 9 being deemed to include any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements to the foregoing), in any Covered Free Writing Prospectus, in any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) of the Company, which "issuer information" is required to be, or is, filed with the Commission, or in any Prospectus together with any combination of one or more of the Covered Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, with respect to such Prospectus or Permitted
 
Free Writing Prospectus, insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, a Prospectus or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "") is brought against a person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or an Underwriter (as applicable, the "") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which

indemnifying party
provided
however
 
such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise. The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
 
not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the
 
Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.
10. .

We have further assumed that each of the parties to the Underwriting Agreement other than the Company is duly qualified to engage in the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement; that the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligations of, each of the parties thereto other than Company, and is enforceable against the parties thereto other than the Company in accordance with its terms; that the parties to the Underwriting Agreement other than the Company have the requisite power and authority to perform their respective obligations under the Underwriting Agreement; and that there are no documents, agreements or understandings among or between any parties to the Underwriting Agreement or others that would modify the respective rights and

obligations of such parties as set forth in the Underwriting Agreement or that otherwise would have an effect on the opinions rendered below.
As to matters of fact material to our opinions, we have relied solely upon our review of the documents referred to in the second paragraph of this letter, and upon oral advice from the staff of the Commission. We have assumed that the recitals of fact and the representations and warranties of all parties as to factual matters set forth in the documents referred to above are true, complete and correct on the date hereof. We have not independently verified any factual matters or the validity of any assumptions made by us in this letter, and we express no opinion or belief, and disclaim any implication or inference, as to the reasonableness of any such assumption.
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have considered only Applicable Laws (as defined herein). "" means the Delaware General Corporation Law and those laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the United States of America and the State of California presently in effect that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. Without suggesting that any of the following might otherwise be applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, "Applicable Laws" specifically does not include, among other laws, the following "": any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, decisions or administrative interpretations (a) of any county, locality or municipality, (b) pertaining to taxes (except United States federal tax law for purposes of paragraph 9 below); securities (except the Securities Act for purposes of paragraphs 6 through 11 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 13 below, and the Investment Company Act for purposes of paragraph 12 below); the regulation of banks, thrifts, savings and loan associations or any similar entity that is engaged in the business of lending as one of its principal business activities, or holding companies of any of the foregoing; labor, employee or management relations; money laundering; privacy; environment; health and safety; trade regulation; franchising; antitrust; intellectual property; unfair competition; or pension, retirement, deferred compensation or any other employee benefits, including ERISA, (c) relating to choice of law or conflicts of law and/or (d) to which the transactions are or may be subject because of the legal or regulatory status of any person other than the Company or because of any facts pertaining to any such person. Although Excluded Laws may apply to the Underwriting Agreement (or performance thereunder), we express no opinion with respect to the effect of Excluded Laws on the matters involved in the opinions set forth herein.
Applicable Laws
Excluded Laws
Whenever a statement or opinion herein is qualified by the phrase "known to us," "to our knowledge," "of which we are aware," or any similar phrase, we intend to indicate that during the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to the attention of those attorneys currently employed by this law firm who have rendered legal services to the Company in connection with substantive legal matters that would give such attorneys actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statements or opinions. We have not undertaken or conducted any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of statements or opinions
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

herein qualified as described in the preceding sentence, and any limited inquiry undertaken by us during the preparation of this opinion letter should not be regarded as such an investigation; no inference as to our knowledge of any matters bearing on the accuracy of any such statement or opinion should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company. Further, we call to your attention that the Company is a holding company for, and therefore engages directly or indirectly in, multi-faceted and complex businesses, and that we have not represented the Company in connection with all of its business activities. Accordingly, our actual knowledge typically does not extend to or encompass any matter or issue as to which we have not advised the Company.
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following:
(i) The factual basis for our opinions in paragraph 1 below is based solely on our review of the Charters, the Minute Books, the Good Standing Certificates and the Officers' Certificates;
(ii) Our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d), and paragraph 13 below are based solely upon an examination of the Company Contracts. We have made no further investigation. With regard to the Company Contracts, we have assumed with respect to each Company Contract that such Company Contract would be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and that it is governed by the substantive laws of the State of California (without regard to conflicts-of-law and choice-of-law principles), even though the terms of such Company Contract may provide that the law of a jurisdiction other than California is the governing law of such Company Contract.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President and Associate General Counsel of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated January 23, 2012 (the "Agreement"), by and among you and the Company regarding the purchase by you of 400,000 shares of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A of The Charles Schwab Corporation. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, have the same meanings given them in the Agreement.
I have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-178525) (the "Registration Statement"), the Prospectus Supplement, the Disclosure Package, the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011, and the Company's current reports on Form 8-K filed on January 18, 2011, March 21, 2011, May 9, 2011, May 23, 2011 and September 1, 2011.
 
In addition, I have examined the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab"), Schwab Holdings, Inc. ("Schwab Holdings"), Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. ("CSIM"), and Charles Schwab Bank ("Schwab Bank"), and such corporate records, certificates and other documents (of which I am aware) and such questions of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering the opinions that follow.
In giving the opinions that follow I have relied as to matters of fact without investigation, to the extent I deemed proper, upon certificates from officers of the Company and certain of its affiliates, and certificates, telegrams, facsimiles, and other documents from, and oral conversations with, public officials. I have assumed without investigation the authenticity of each document submitted to me as an original, the conformity to the originals of each document submitted to me as a copy, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. Schwab Bank is a federal savings bank under the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
2. Each of Schwab, Schwab Holdings, Schwab Bank and CSIM is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualifications, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
3. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and are not so described.
This opinion is dated as of January 26, 2012 ("Opinion Date"). The opinions expressed herein are given as of the Opinion Date only, and are not given as of any later date. I have not undertaken any factual or legal investigation beyond the Opinion Date, and I disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person after the Opinion Date if any change in fact and/or law should change my opinion with respect to any matters set forth herein.
I am a member of the bar of the State of California. I express no opinion as to any laws of any other jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States to the extent applicable to the scope of the opinions expressed above. Further, I express no opinion regarding choice of law or conflicts of laws.
This opinion is rendered to you as Underwriters under the Agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my express written consent.
 
Very truly yours,
R. Scott McMillen
Vice President and Associate General Counsel
 
I, Joseph R. Martinetto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""), on behalf of the Company, do hereby certify pursuant to Section 6(h) of that certain Underwriting Agreement dated January 23, 2012 (the "") among the Company and, on behalf of the several Underwriters named therein, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P.

RESOLVED, that each share of such series of Preferred Stock shall rank equally in all respects and shall be subject to the following provisions:
1. . The series of Preferred Stock shall be designated as the "Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A" (the "Series A Preferred Stock") and the number of shares so designated shall be 400,000. Such number may from time to time be increased (but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. The Corporation may in the future from time to time, without notice to or consent of the holders of the Series A
Designation and Number
 
Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock; , that any such additional shares are not treated as "disqualified preferred stock" within the meaning of Section 1059(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and such additional shares are otherwise treated as fungible with the Series A Preferred Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event that the Corporation issues additional Series A Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such additional shares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date the Corporation specifies at the time such additional shares are issued. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the "Liquidation Preference").

Dividends
(a) Holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (an "Authorized Committee"), out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the Liquidation Preference of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate equal to:
 
(i) 7.000% per annum for each semi-annual Dividend Period from the issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock to, but excluding, February 1, 2022 (the "Fixed Rate Period"); and
(ii) Three-Month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.820% per annum, for each quarterly Dividend Period beginning on February 1, 2022 and continuing indefinitely thereafter or until such Series A Preferred Stock is redeemed or repurchased (the "Floating Rate Period").
(b) If declared by the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee, dividends shall be payable, in arrears, on the Series A Preferred Stock on the following dates (each, a "Dividend Payment Date"):
(i) during the Fixed Rate Period and February 1, 2022, semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2012 and ending on February 1, 2022; and
(ii) during the Floating Rate Period, quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2022.
If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date shall be the next Business Day without any adjustment to the amount of dividends paid.
(c) Dividends shall be payable to holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the Corporation's stock register at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before the applicable Dividend Payment Date, or such other record date, not exceeding 30 days before the applicable Dividend Payment Date, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee.
(d) Dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock for the Fixed Rate Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock for the Floating Rate Period shall be computed based on the actual number of days in a Dividend Period and a 360-day year. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upwards. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue on the redemption date, if any, as described in Section 6, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption.
(e) The dividend rate for each Dividend Period in the Floating Rate Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent using Three-Month LIBOR as in effect on the second London Banking Day prior to the beginning of the Dividend Period, which date is the "Dividend Determination Date" for the Dividend Period. The Calculation Agent shall add the spread of 4.820% per annum to the Three-Month LIBOR rate as determined on the Dividend Determination Date. Absent manifest error, the Calculation Agent's determination of the dividend rate for a Dividend Period will be binding and conclusive on the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the Transfer Agent and the Corporation.
 
(f) Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative. If the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of a Dividend Period, then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such Dividend Period, be payable on the applicable Dividend Payment Date, or be cumulative, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any dividend for that Dividend Period, whether or not the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee declares a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock for any future Dividend Period.
(g) During each Dividend Period while the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, unless the full dividends for the immediately preceding Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside:
(i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than (1) a dividend payable solely in such Junior Stock or (2) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan; and
(ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation) other than:
(1) as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock;
(2) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock;
(3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock;
(4) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants;
(5) purchases of shares of Junior Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Junior Stock existing prior to the preceding Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan; or
(6) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged.
(iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to offers
pro rata
 
to purchase all, or a portion, of the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock, unless such Parity Stock is repurchased, redeemed or acquired for consideration by the Corporation in connection with any of the following:
pro rata
(1) as a result of a reclassification of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock or Junior Stock;
(2) the exchange or conversion of one share of Parity Stock for or into another share of Parity Stock or Junior Stock; or
(3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock.
(h) When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any such Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share shall bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series A Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on any such Parity Stock, bear to each other.
(i) Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be subject to the Corporation's receipt of required prior approval by the Federal Reserve (or any successor bank regulatory authority that may become the Corporation's applicable federal banking agency), if any, and to the satisfaction of conditions set forth in the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the Federal Reserve (or any successor bank regulatory authority that may become the Corporation's applicable federal banking agency) applicable to dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, if any.
(j) Subject to the foregoing restrictions, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee, may be declared and paid on the Corporation's common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.
4. .
Liquidation Rights
(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a liquidation distribution of $1,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends (the "Liquidation Distribution"), before the Corporation makes any distribution of assets to the holders of the Corporation's common stock or any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to such distribution. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received their Liquidation Distribution in full.
(b) In any such distribution, if the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Distribution in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of
 
any class or series of stock ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of such parity stock shall be paid in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Distribution owed to those holders. If the Liquidation Distribution has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such parity stock, the holders of any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to such distribution shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.
pro rata
For purposes of this Section 4, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.
5. .
Voting Rights
(a) The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights, except as provided herein or as required by law.
(b) Whenever dividends payable on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock have not been paid for three semi-annual Dividend Periods or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, or their equivalent, whether or not consecutive, then the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, with holders of any other equally ranked series of preferred stock that have similar voting rights and on which dividends likewise have not been paid (the "Voting Parity Securities"), voting together as a class, at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of at least 20% of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities (unless such request for a special meeting is received less than 90 calendar days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders, in which event such election shall be held only at such next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders) or at the Corporation's next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders, to elect two additional directors to the Board of Directors; provided, that the election of any such director does not cause the Corporation to violate the applicable corporate governance requirements of the exchange or trading market where the Corporation's common stock is then listed or quoted, as the case may be. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing such directors, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares representing at least a majority of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class, shall be required to constitute a quorum of such shares. The affirmative vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class, representing a majority of the voting power of such shares present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to elect any such director.
(c) Immediately prior to the election of any such directors, the number of directors that comprise the Board of Directors shall be increased by two. Such voting rights and the term of the additional directors so elected shall continue until:
 
(i) continuous non-cumulative dividends for at least two consecutive semi-annual dividend periods or four consecutive quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, or their equivalent; and
(ii) cumulative dividends, if any, payable for all past dividend periods,
shall have been paid, or declared and set aside for payment, in full, on all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or the Voting Parity Securities entitled thereto. At that point, the right to elect additional directors shall terminate and the terms of office of the two additional directors so elected shall terminate immediately, and the number of directors shall be reduced by two and such voting rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities shall cease, subject to any increase in the number of directors as described above due to the revesting of such voting rights in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends for three semi-annual Dividend Periods or six quarterly Dividend Periods, as applicable, or their equivalent, whether or not consecutive, as described above.
(d) Holders of Series A Preferred Stock, together with holders of any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class, may remove any director they elected. Any vacancy created by the removal of any such director may be filled only by the vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class. If the office of either such director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining director may choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term of the vacant office. In the event that both offices are vacant, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities may, as set forth in Section 5(b), call a special meeting and elect such directors at such special meeting, or elect such directors at the Corporation's next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders.
(e) The number of votes that each share of Series A Preferred Stock and any stock ranking equally with the Series A Preferred Stock participating in the votes described above shall be in proportion to the Liquidation Preference of such share.
(f) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock voting separately as a class, shall be required to:
(i) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation (including this Certificate of Designations), or the Bylaws, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock; , that any of the following will not be deemed to adversely affect such powers, preferences, privileges or special rights:
provided
(1) increases in the amount of the authorized common stock or, except as provided in Section 5(f)(ii), preferred stock;
(2) increases or decreases in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock; or
 
(3) the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of capital stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable into such capital stock) ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock;
(ii) amend or alter the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize or increase the authorized amount of or issue shares of any class or series of Senior Stock, or reclassify any of the Corporation's authorized capital stock into any such shares of Senior Stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of Senior Stock; or
(iii) consummate a binding share exchange, a reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity; , however, that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case:
provided
(1) the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity (or its ultimate parent) that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; and
(2) the Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or the new preferred securities, as the case may be, have such powers, preferences and special rights as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the powers, preferences and special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock.
The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption in accordance with Section 6 upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.
6. .
Redemption
(a) .The Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock.
No Mandatory Redemption
(b) . The Corporation may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at the Corporation's option, in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after February 1, 2022, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends (the "Redemption Price").

(e) .In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either , by lot or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of Directors shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.
Partial Redemption
