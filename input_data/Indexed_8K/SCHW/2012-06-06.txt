The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, if (1) since the time of execution of this Agreement or the earlier respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectuses, the Prospectus and the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, there has been any change or any development involving a prospective change in the business, properties, management, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, the effect of which change or development is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Depositary Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectuses, the Prospectus and the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or (2) since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred: (A) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market; (B) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's common stock on the NYSE; (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (D) an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or a declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (E) any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (D) or (E), in your sole judgment, makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Depositary Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectuses, the Prospectus and the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or (3) since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any downgrading, or any notice or announcement shall have been given or made of: (A) any intended or potential downgrading or (B) any watch, review or possible change that does not indicate an affirmation or improvement in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term
 
is used in Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act.
If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 7, the Company and each other Underwriter shall be notified promptly in writing.
If the sale to the Underwriters of the Depositary Shares, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this Agreement, or if such sale is not carried out because the Company shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(o), 5 and 9 hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof) or to one another hereunder.
8. . Subject to Sections 6 and 7 hereof, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Depositary Shares to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6 hereof or a reason sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Section 7 hereof) and if the aggregate liquidation preference of Depositary Shares which all Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total aggregate liquidation preference of Depositary Shares, the non-defaulting Underwriters (including the Underwriters, if any, substituted in the manner set forth below) shall take up and pay for (in addition to the liquidation preference of Depositary Shares they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the liquidation preference of Depositary Shares agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such Depositary Shares shall be taken up and paid for by such non-defaulting Underwriters in such amount or amounts as you may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in the event no such designation is made, such Depositary Shares shall be taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the liquidation preference of Depositary Shares set forth opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters in .
Increase in Underwriters' Commitments
Schedule A
Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Depositary Shares hereunder unless all of the Depositary Shares are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by you with the approval of the Company or selected by the Company with your approval).
If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or by the Company for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Company or you shall have the right to postpone the Time of Purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and other documents may be effected.
The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in hereto.
Schedule A
 
If the aggregate liquidation preference of Depositary Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total aggregate liquidation preference of Depositary Shares which all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Company shall make arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase of all the Depositary Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of the Company to any Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter to the Company. Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
9. .
Indemnity and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers, and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any "affiliate" that sells Depositary Shares on behalf of such Underwriters, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in the Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Prospectus (the term Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 9 being deemed to include any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements to the foregoing), in any Covered Free Writing Prospectus, in any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) of the Company, which "issuer information" is required to be, or is, filed with the Commission, or in any Prospectus together with any combination of one or more of the Covered Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, with respect to such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim
 
arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the Company expressly for use in, a Prospectus or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(c) If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a "") is brought against a person (an "") in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or an Underwriter (as applicable, the "") pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively, of this Section 9, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise. The
Proceeding
indemnified party
indemnifying party
provided
however
 
indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Depositary Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative
 
fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Depositary Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Depositary Shares underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Depositary Shares. The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Depositary Shares, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Basic
 
Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.
10. . The statements set forth in the first three sentences of the sixth paragraph, and in the twelfth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, only insofar as such statements relate to the amount of selling concession and reallowance or stabilization activities that may be undertaken by the Underwriters, constitute the only information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriters, as such information is referred to in Sections 3 and 9 hereof.

Transaction Agreements
In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the legal capacity of individuals, that the signatures on all documents not executed in our presence are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, that all documents submitted to us as reproduced or certified copies conform to the original documents, that all Company Contracts filed with the Commission conform to the original documents, that all corporate records of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries provided to us for review are accurate and complete, and that any reviews and searches of public records obtained by us are accurate and complete. We have further assumed that each of the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company is duly qualified to engage in the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; that the Transaction Agreements have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of, each of the parties thereto other than the Company, and are enforceable against the parties thereto other than the Company in accordance with their respective terms; that the parties to the Transaction Agreements other than the Company have the requisite power and authority to perform their respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements executed and delivered by them; and that there are no documents, agreements or understandings among or between any parties to the Transaction Agreements or others that would modify the respective rights and obligations of such parties as set forth in the Transaction Agreements or that otherwise would have an effect on the opinions rendered below.
As to matters of fact material to our opinions, we have relied solely upon our review of the documents referred to in the second paragraph of this letter, and upon oral advice from the staff of the Commission. We have assumed that the recitals of fact and the representations and warranties of all parties as to factual matters set forth in the documents referred to above are true, complete and correct on the date hereof. We have not independently verified any factual matters or the validity of any assumptions made by us in this letter, and we express no opinion or belief, and disclaim any implication or inference, as to the reasonableness of any such assumption.
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have considered only Applicable Laws (as defined herein). "" means those laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the United States of America and the State of California presently in effect that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (collectively, "") and the Delaware General Corporation Law; , , that, with respect to our opinions in clause (ii) of the second sentence of paragraph 4 below, and in the second sentence of paragraph 5 below, "Applicable Laws" means those laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the United States of America and the State of New York presently in effect that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Deposit Agreement (collectively, "") and the Delaware General Corporation Law; and provided, further, that, with respect to our opinions in the last sentence of paragraph 3 below, "Applicable Laws" means California Law, New York Law, and the Delaware General Corporation Law; and , , that, with respect to execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements, "Applicable Laws" means California Law, to the

extent such execution and delivery are governed by California Law, New York Law, to the extent such execution and delivery are governed by New York Law, and the Delaware General Corporation Law, to the extent such execution and delivery are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Without suggesting that any of the following might otherwise be applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, "Applicable Laws" specifically does not include, among other laws, the following "": any laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, decisions or administrative interpretations (a) of any county, locality or municipality, (b) pertaining to taxes (except United States federal tax law for purposes of paragraph 9 below); securities (except the Securities Act for purposes of paragraphs 6 through 11 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 13 below, and the Investment Company Act for purposes of paragraph 12 below); the regulation of banks, thrifts, savings and loan associations or any similar entity that is engaged in the business of lending as one of its principal business activities, or holding companies of any of the foregoing; labor, employee or management relations; money laundering; privacy; environment; health and safety; trade regulation; franchising; antitrust; intellectual property; unfair competition; or pension, retirement, deferred compensation or any other employee benefits, including ERISA, (c) relating to choice of law or conflicts of law and/or (d) to which the transactions are or may be subject because of the legal or regulatory status of any person other than the Company or because of any facts pertaining to any such person. Although Excluded Laws may apply to the Transaction Agreements (or performance thereunder), we express no opinion with respect to the effect of Excluded Laws on the matters involved in the opinions set forth herein.
Excluded Laws
Whenever an opinion herein is qualified by the phrase "known to us," "to our knowledge," "of which we are aware," or any similar phrase, we intend to indicate that during the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to the attention of those attorneys currently employed by this law firm who have rendered legal services to the Company in connection with substantive legal matters that would give such attorneys actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such opinion. We have not undertaken or conducted any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of any such opinion, and any limited inquiry undertaken by us during the preparation of the opinions herein should not be regarded as such an investigation; no inference as to our knowledge of any matters bearing on the accuracy of any such opinion should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Company. Further, we call to your attention that the Company is a holding company for, and therefore engages directly or indirectly in, multi-faceted and complex businesses, and that we have not represented the Company in connection with all of its business activities. Accordingly, our actual knowledge typically does not extend to or encompass any matter or issue as to which we have not advised the Company.
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following:
(i) The factual basis for our opinions in paragraph 1 below is based solely on our review of the Charters, the Minute Books, the Good Standing Certificates and the Officers' Certificates;
(ii) Our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d), and paragraph 13 below are based solely upon an examination of the Company Contracts. We have made no further investigation. With regard to the Company Contracts, we have assumed with respect to each
 
Company Contract that such Company Contract would be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and that it is governed by the substantive laws of the State of California (without regard to conflicts-of-law and choice-of-law principles), even though the terms of such Company Contract may provide that the law of a jurisdiction other than California is the governing law of such Company Contract. We express no opinion as to any statement or writing that may constitute parol evidence bearing on interpretation or construction of any Company Contract. Further, to the extent that any of the Company Contracts contain any financial covenants, provisions relating to the occurrence of a "material adverse effect" or similar provisions, for purposes of our opinions in paragraph 3, clauses (c) and (d) below, we have relied solely on the Officers' Certificates as to (i) the Company's compliance with any and all such financial covenants and provisions, and (ii) the conclusion that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements and the issuance and sale of the Securities do not, under any such financial covenants or provisions, constitute a default or result in the imposition of a lien or encumbrance, and we have undertaken no investigation or analysis, nor conducted any financial computations, with respect thereto;
(iii) Our opinion in the second sentence of paragraph 7 below is based solely upon oral advice from the staff of the Commission;
(iv) Except to the limited extent set forth in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 below and the statement immediately following paragraph 13 below, we express no opinion whatsoever as to the compliance or noncompliance by any person with antifraud or information delivery provisions of state or federal laws, rules and regulations; and
(v) We express no opinion regarding the rights or remedies available to any party for material violations or breaches that are the proximate result of actions taken by any party other than the party against whom enforcement is sought.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Company, Holdings and CSIM is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. CS & Co. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California. The Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the State of California. CS & Co. is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington.
2. Each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries has the corporate power and corporate authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Transaction Agreements. The Company's execution, delivery and performance of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements, including the deposit of the Series B Preferred Stock in accordance
 
with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Board of Directors of the Company.
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements on the date hereof in accordance with its terms and the issuance and sale of the Securities do not (a) violate the Charters or the Bylaws, (b) violate any judgment, writ, decree or order of any court to which the Company is named as a party and of which we are aware, (c) constitute a default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary under any Company Contract, or (d) result in the imposition of a lien or encumbrance on any material properties of the Company or of any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to any Company Contract. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Agreements, and the issuance and sale of the Securities on the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Agreements, do not violate any Applicable Law.
4. The Company's authorized capital stock is as set forth in the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement. The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement and the Deposit Agreement, (i) the Securities will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and (ii) the holders of the Depositary Shares will be entitled to the rights specified in the Deposit Agreement and the Global Depositary Receipt. The Global Depositary Receipt complies with the form therefor prescribed in the Deposit Agreement.
5. The Transaction Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by the Company. The Deposit Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
6. No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing with, any Delaware, California or federal governmental authority is required by the Company under any Applicable Law in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements in accordance with their respective terms, and the issuance and the sale of the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Agreements, other than (i) those that have already been obtained and are in full force and effect, and (ii) those that are required or permitted to be obtained after the date hereof (except that we express no opinion with respect to any consent, approval, authorization, designation, declaration or filing required under the state securities or "blue sky" laws of the various jurisdictions in which the Securities are being offered by the Underwriters, and we express no opinion with respect to the Conduct Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)).
7. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act. To our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose are pending under the Securities Act. The Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement were filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.
8. The Registration Statement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus) appears on its face to be responsive as to form in all material
 
respects to all applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including without limitation Section 10(a) of the Securities Act), , , that we express no view as to any financial statements, schedules and notes and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom and included therein.
provided
however
9. The statements contained in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute in all material respects accurate summaries of such matters or conclusions, as the case may be.
10. The statements contained in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of Series B Preferred Stock" and "Description of Depositary Shares," and the statements contained in the Basic Prospectus under the caption "Description of Preferred Stock" and "Description of Depositary Shares," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of documents referred to therein or summaries of matters of law, constitute in all material respects accurate summaries of such terms or matters, as the case may be.
11. To our knowledge, there are no contracts or documents required under the Securities Act (i) to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein which have not been so filed or incorporated by reference as required, or (ii) to be described in the Registration Statement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus) which have not been so described as required.
12. The Company is not, and will not become as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "").
Investment Company Act
13. No person has the right (which right has not been waived or complied with) pursuant to the terms of any Company Contract to cause the Company to register under the Securities Act any Securities or shares of any other capital stock or other equity interest of the Company, or to include any such shares or interest in the Registration Statement or the offering contemplated thereby.
In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus), we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, including representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company, and representatives of the Underwriters, including their counsel, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement were discussed (except that the Underwriters and their counsel did not participate in any such conferences at the time of the preparation and filing of the 2011 Registration Statement). Although we have not independently verified, are not passing upon and do not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the
 
Prospectus) or any amendments or supplements thereto (except to the limited extent set forth in paragraphs 9 and 10 above), on the basis of the foregoing, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that (i) as of the Effective Time, the Registration Statement contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) as of its date or as of the date hereof, the Prospectus contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, , , that we express no view as to (a) any financial statements, schedules and notes and other financial and statistical information derived therefrom and included in any of the foregoing, or (b) the representations and warranties contained in any exhibit to the Registration Statement, or in any document incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement.

however
Our opinions in clause (ii) of the second sentence of paragraph 4 above, and in the second sentence of paragraph 5 above, are subject to the following:
(a) Such opinions are subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws. In addition, the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief, the appointment of a receiver and other equitable remedies is subject to the discretion of the tribunal before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
(b) Notwithstanding any language of the Deposit Agreement to the contrary, indemnification of any party thereunder may be limited to recovery of only reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses. Such opinions, insofar as they relate to the enforceability of indemnification provisions set forth in the Deposit Agreement, are subject to laws and judicial decisions rendering unenforceable indemnification contrary to federal and state securities laws and the public policies underlying such laws, and laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action involves negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(c) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions of the Deposit Agreement to the extent they contain:
 
 
 
 
(d) We express no opinion as to whether courts other than state or federal courts in the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New York law governing the Deposit Agreement.
(e) Insofar as such opinions relate to the provisions of the Deposit Agreement regarding jurisdiction, service of process and venue (and the defense of an inconvenient forum), such opinions are limited to jurisdiction and service of process in respect of any action arising out of or based upon the Deposit Agreement brought, or sought to be brought, in any New York State or U.S. federal court in The City of New York. We express no opinion as to the subject matter jurisdiction of any federal court of the United States of America over any action between two parties neither of which is a "citizen" of any State for the purposes of 28 U.S.C.  1332.
Wherever above we have rendered an opinion regarding a document, the opinion is limited to that document and does not encompass, cover or pertain to, or take into account the potential effect on the opinion rendered above of, any agreement attached as a schedule or an exhibit to that document, referred to in that document or executed contemporaneously with that document, except for any such other agreement or exhibit that is expressly referred to in the relevant opining language.
Notwithstanding anything in this opinion letter to the contrary, the opinions set forth above are given only as of the date hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any opinion rendered above that refers to the performance of obligations under any Transaction Agreement assumes that there have been no changes in facts or law since the date hereof at the time of such performance. We disclaim any obligation to update any of the opinions rendered herein and express no opinion as to the effect of events occurring, circumstances arising, or changes of law that become effective or occur, after the date hereof on the matters addressed in this opinion letter, and we assume no responsibility to inform you of additional or changed facts, or changes in law, of which we may become aware.
The opinions set forth above are expressly limited to the matters stated. No opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond what is explicitly stated in this letter. This letter is rendered solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and may not be relied upon by any other person or entity. Copies of this letter may not be circulated or furnished to any other person or entity and this letter may not be referred to in any report or document furnished to any other person or entity, without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President and Associate General Counsel of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated May 30, 2012 (the "Agreement"), by and among you and the Company regarding the purchase by you of [    ] depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the [    ]% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
 
Stock, Series B of The Charles Schwab Corporation. Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, have the same meanings given them in the Agreement.
I have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-178525) (the "Registration Statement"), the Prospectus Supplement, the Disclosure Package, the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, and the Company's current reports on Form 8-K filed on January 26, 2012, February 2, 2012, March 13, 2012 and May 22, 2012.
In addition, I have examined the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab"), Schwab Holdings, Inc. ("Schwab Holdings"), Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. ("CSIM"), and Charles Schwab Bank ("Schwab Bank"), and such corporate records, certificates and other documents (of which I am aware) and such questions of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of rendering the opinions that follow.
In giving the opinions that follow I have relied as to matters of fact without investigation, to the extent I deemed proper, upon certificates from officers of the Company and certain of its affiliates, and certificates, telegrams, facsimiles, and other documents from, and oral conversations with, public officials. I have assumed without investigation the authenticity of each document submitted to me as an original, the conformity to the originals of each document submitted to me as a copy, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents, the genuineness of all signatures, and the legal capacity of all natural persons.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. Schwab Bank is a federal savings bank under the supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
2. Each of Schwab, Schwab Holdings, Schwab Bank and CSIM is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualifications, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
3. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and are not so described.
This opinion is dated as of June 6, 2012 ("Opinion Date"). The opinions expressed herein are given as of the Opinion Date only, and are not given as of any later date. I have not undertaken any factual or legal investigation beyond the Opinion Date, and I disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person after the Opinion Date if any change in fact and/or law should change my opinion with respect to any matters set forth herein.
 
I am a member of the bar of the State of California. I express no opinion as to any laws of any other jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States to the extent applicable to the scope of the opinions expressed above. Further, I express no opinion regarding choice of law or conflicts of laws.
This opinion is rendered to you as Underwriters under the Agreement and may not be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my express written consent.
 
 
I, Joseph R. Martinetto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""), on behalf of the Company, do hereby certify pursuant to Section 6(h) of that certain Underwriting Agreement dated May 30, 2012 (the "") among the Company and, on behalf of the several Underwriters named therein, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, that as of June 6, 2012:

Dividends
(a) Holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (an "Authorized Committee"), out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the Liquidation Preference of the Series B Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 6.00% per annum for each quarterly Dividend Period from the date of initial issuance and continuing indefinitely thereafter or until such Series B Preferred Stock is redeemed or repurchased.
 
(b) If declared by the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee, dividends shall be payable, in arrears, on the Series B Preferred Stock quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2012 (each, a "Dividend Payment Date").
If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date shall be the next Business Day without any adjustment to the amount of dividends paid.
(c) Dividends shall be payable to holders of record of Series B Preferred Stock as they appear on the Corporation's stock register at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before the applicable Dividend Payment Date, or such other record date, not exceeding 30 days before the applicable Dividend Payment Date, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee.
(d) Dividends payable on the Series B Preferred Stock shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upwards. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue on the redemption date, if any, as described in Section 6, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption.
(e) Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative. If the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee does not declare a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock in respect of a Dividend Period, then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such Dividend Period, be payable on the applicable Dividend Payment Date, or be cumulative, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any dividend for that Dividend Period, whether or not the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee declares a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock for any future Dividend Period.
(f) During each Dividend Period while the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding, unless the full dividends for the immediately preceding Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside:
(i) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock, other than (1) a dividend payable solely in such Junior Stock or (2) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan; and
(ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation) other than:
(1) as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock;
 
(2) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock;
(3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock;
(4) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants;
(5) purchases of shares of Junior Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Junior Stock existing prior to the preceding Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan; or
(6) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged.
(iii) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation otherwise than pursuant to offers to purchase all, or a portion, of the Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock, unless such Parity Stock is repurchased, redeemed or acquired for consideration by the Corporation in connection with any of the following:
pro rata
pro rata
(1) as a result of a reclassification of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock or Junior Stock;
(2) the exchange or conversion of one share of Parity Stock for or into another share of Parity Stock or Junior Stock; or
(3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock.
(g) When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any such Parity Stock shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share shall bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series B Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on any such Parity Stock, bear to each other.
(h) Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will be subject to the Corporation's receipt of required prior approval by the Federal Reserve (or any successor bank regulatory authority that may become the Corporation's applicable federal banking agency), if any, and to the satisfaction of conditions set forth in the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the Federal Reserve (or any successor bank regulatory authority that may become the Corporation's applicable federal banking agency) applicable to dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, if any.
 
(i) Subject to the foregoing restrictions, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board of Directors or an Authorized Committee, may be declared and paid on the Corporation's common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series B Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend.
4. Liquidation Rights.
(a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a liquidation distribution of $1,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends (the "Liquidation Distribution"), before the Corporation makes any distribution of assets to the holders of the Corporation's common stock or any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to such distribution. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received their Liquidation Distribution in full.
(b) In any such distribution, if the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Distribution in full to all holders of Series B Preferred Stock and all holders of any class or series of stock ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and all holders of such parity stock shall be paid in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Distribution owed to those holders. If the Liquidation Distribution has been paid in full to all holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such parity stock, the holders of any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to such distribution shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences.
pro rata
For purposes of this Section 4, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination of any other corporation or person into or with the Corporation be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.
5. Voting Rights.
(a) The holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights, except as provided herein or as required by law.
(b) Whenever dividends payable on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock have not been paid for six quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, then the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the right, with holders of any other equally ranked series of preferred stock that have similar voting rights and on which dividends likewise have not been paid (the "Voting Parity Securities"), voting together as a class, at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of at least 20% of the voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock and
 
any Voting Parity Securities (unless such request for a special meeting is received less than 90 calendar days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders, in which event such election shall be held only at such next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders) or at the Corporation's next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders, to elect two additional directors to the Board of Directors; provided, that the election of any such director does not cause the Corporation to violate the applicable corporate governance requirements of the exchange or trading market where the Corporation's common stock is then listed or quoted, as the case may be. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing such directors, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares representing at least a majority of the voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class, shall be required to constitute a quorum of such shares. The affirmative vote of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class, representing a majority of the voting power of such shares present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to elect any such director.
(c) Immediately prior to the election of any such directors, the number of directors that comprise the Board of Directors shall be increased by two. Such voting rights and the term of the additional directors so elected shall continue until:
(i) continuous non-cumulative dividends for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods; and
(ii) cumulative dividends, if any, payable for all past dividend periods,
shall have been paid, or declared and set aside for payment, in full, on all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock or the Voting Parity Securities entitled thereto. At that point, the right to elect additional directors shall terminate and the terms of office of the two additional directors so elected shall terminate immediately, and the number of directors shall be reduced by two and such voting rights of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities shall cease, subject to any increase in the number of directors as described above due to the revesting of such voting rights in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends for six quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, as described above.
(d) Holders of Series B Preferred Stock, together with holders of any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class, may remove any director they elected. Any vacancy created by the removal of any such director may be filled only by the vote of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities, voting together as a class. If the office of either such director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining director may choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term of the vacant office. In the event that both offices are vacant, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Securities may, as set forth in Section 5(b), call a special meeting and elect such directors at such special meeting, or elect such directors at the Corporation's next annual or special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders.
 
(e) The number of votes that each share of Series B Preferred Stock and any stock ranking equally with the Series B Preferred Stock participating in the votes described above shall be in proportion to the Liquidation Preference of such share.
(f) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock voting separately as a class, shall be required to:
(i) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation (including this Certificate of Designations), or the Bylaws, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock; , that any of the following will not be deemed to adversely affect such powers, preferences, privileges or special rights:
provided
(1) increases in the amount of the authorized common stock or, except as provided in Section 5(f)(ii), preferred stock;
(2) increases or decreases in the number of shares of any series of preferred stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series B Preferred Stock; or
(3) the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of capital stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable into such capital stock) ranking equally with or junior to the Series B Preferred Stock;
(ii) amend or alter the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize or increase the authorized amount of or issue shares of any class or series of Senior Stock, or reclassify any of the Corporation's authorized capital stock into any such shares of Senior Stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of Senior Stock; or
(iii) consummate a binding share exchange, a reclassification involving the Series B Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity; , however, that the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case:
provided
(1) the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity (or its ultimate parent) that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; and
(2) the Series B Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or the new preferred securities, as the case may be, have such powers, preferences and special rights as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the powers, preferences and special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock.
 
The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption in accordance with Section 6 upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.

(e) .In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either , by lot or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be equitable.

Depositary may designate. Delivery at other offices shall be at the risk and expense of the person requesting such delivery.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by duly authorized attorney, properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer. Thereupon, the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing the same aggregate number of Depositary Shares as those evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered and deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the person entitled thereto.
The Depositary shall not be required (a) to issue, transfer or exchange any Receipts for a period beginning at the opening of business fifteen days next preceding any selection of Depositary Shares and Stock to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of notice of redemption, or (b) to transfer or exchange for another Receipt any Receipt called or being called for redemption in whole or in part except as provided in Section 2.8.
 
Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as it may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall execute a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denomination or denominations requested, evidencing the aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered, and shall deliver such new Receipt or Receipts to or upon the order of the holder of the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered.
Any holder of a Receipt or Receipts may withdraw the number of whole shares of Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts, at the Depositary's Office or at such other offices as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals. Thereafter, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, or to the person or persons designated by such holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but holders of such whole shares of Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Stock hereunder or to receive a Receipt evidencing Depositary Shares therefor. If a Receipt delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of Stock to be so withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be so withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or subject to Section 2.3 upon such holder's order, a new Receipt evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.
 
Except as provided in Section 6.2, in no event will fractional shares of Stock (or any cash payment in lieu thereof) be delivered by the Depositary. Delivery of the Stock and money and other property, if any, being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate.
If the Stock and the money and other property, if any, being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the record holder of the Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of Stock, such holder shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such holder for withdrawal of such shares of Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer in blank.
Delivery of the Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal shall be made by the Depositary at the Depositary's Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such holder.
 
As a condition precedent to the execution and delivery, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, surrender or exchange of any Receipt, the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Corporation may require payment to it of a sum sufficient for the payment (or, in the event that the Depositary or the Corporation shall have made such payment, the reimbursement to it) of any charges or expenses payable by the holder of a Receipt pursuant to Section 5.7, may require the production of evidence satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature, and any other reasonable evidence of authority that may be required by the Depositary and may also require compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or the Corporation may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and/or applicable law.
The deposit of Stock may be refused, the delivery of Receipts against Stock may be suspended, the registration of transfer of Receipts may be refused and the registration of transfer, surrender or exchange of outstanding Receipts may be suspended (i) during any period when the register of stockholders of the Corporation is closed or (ii) if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary, any of the Depositary's Agents or the Corporation at any time or from time to time because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission or under any provision of this Deposit Agreement.
 
In case any Receipt shall be mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Depositary in its discretion may execute and deliver a Receipt of like form and tenor in exchange and substitution for such mutilated Receipt, or in lieu of and in substitution for such destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt, upon (i) the filing by the holder thereof with the Depositary of evidence satisfactory to the Depositary of such destruction or loss or theft of such Receipt, of the authenticity thereof and
 
of such holder's ownership thereof and (ii) the holder thereof furnishing of the Depositary with reasonable indemnification satisfactory to the Depositary.
 
All Receipts surrendered to the Depositary or any Depositary's Agent shall be cancelled by the Depositary. Except as prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Depositary is authorized and directed to destroy all Receipts so cancelled.
 
Whenever the Corporation shall be permitted and shall elect to redeem shares of Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designations (including on account of a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as described therein), it shall (unless otherwise agreed to in writing with the Depositary) give or cause to be given to the Depositary, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (as defined below), notice of the date of such proposed redemption of Stock and of the number of such shares held by the Depositary to be so redeemed and the Depositary Share Redemption Price, which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Corporation stating that such redemption of Stock is in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designations. On the date of such redemption, provided that the Corporation shall then have paid or caused to be paid in full to the Depositary the Redemption Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) per share of Stock to be redeemed, in accordance with and as required by the provisions of the Certificate of Designations, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Stock. The Depositary shall mail notice of the Corporation's redemption of Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the number of Depositary Shares representing the Stock to be redeemed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of such Stock and Depositary Shares (the ""), to the record holders of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed at the addresses of such holders as they appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither failure to mail any such notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more such holders nor any defect in any notice of redemption of Depositary Shares to one or more such holders shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption as to the other holders. Each such notice shall be prepared by the Corporation and shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the number of Depositary Shares to be redeemed and, if less than all the Depositary Shares held by any such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (iii) the Depositary Share Redemption Price; (iv) the place or places where Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the Depositary Share Redemption Price and (v) that dividends on such shares of Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date. In case less than all the outstanding Depositary Shares are to be redeemed, the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed shall be selected either , by lot or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be equitable.
Redemption Date
pro rata
Notice having been mailed by the Depositary as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation shall have failed to provide the funds necessary to redeem the Stock evidenced by the Depositary Shares called for redemption) (i) all shares of Stock called for
 
redemption shall cease to be outstanding and any rights with respect to such shares shall cease and terminate (except for the right to receive the Preferred Stock Redemption Price without interest), (ii) the Depositary Shares being redeemed from such proceeds shall cease to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate (except the right to receive the Depositary Share Redemption Price without interest), and (iii) upon surrender in accordance with such redemption notice of the Receipts evidencing any such Depositary Shares called for redemption (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary or applicable law shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed by the Depositary at a redemption price per Depositary Share (the "") equal to one-fortieth of the Preferred Stock Redemption Price per share of Stock so redeemed plus all money and other property, if any, represented by such Depositary Shares.
Depositary Share Redemption Price
If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with the redemption payment, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
 
If the Corporation shall determine in a writing delivered to the Depositary that the Receipts are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Registered Receipts, then the Depositary shall, in accordance with the other provisions of this Deposit Agreement, execute and deliver one or more Global Registered Receipts evidencing such Receipts, which (i) shall represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, the Receipts to be represented by such Global Registered Receipt or Receipts, and (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Global Receipt Depository therefor or its nominee.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement to the contrary, unless otherwise provided in the Global Registered Receipt, a Global Registered Receipt may only be transferred in whole and only by the applicable Global Receipt Depository for such Global Registered Receipt to a nominee of such Global Receipt Depository, or by a nominee of such Global Receipt Depository to such Global Receipt Depository or another nominee of such Global Receipt Depository, or by such Global Receipt Depository or any such nominee to a successor Global Receipt Depository for such Global Registered Receipt selected or approved by the Corporation or to a nominee of such successor Global Receipt Depository. Except as provided below, owners solely of beneficial interests in a Global Registered Receipt shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Receipts represented by such Global Registered Receipt. Neither any such beneficial owner nor any direct or indirect participant of a Global Receipt Depository shall have any rights under this Deposit Agreement with respect to any Global Registered Receipt held on their behalf by a Global Receipt Depository and such Global Receipt Depository may be treated by the Corporation, the Depositary and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or the Depositary as the holder of such Global Registered Receipt for all purposes whatsoever.
 
Unless and until definitive Receipts are delivered to the owners of the beneficial interests in a Global Registered Receipt, (1) the applicable Global Receipt Depository will make book-entry transfers among its participants and receive and transmit all payments and distributions in respect of the Global Registered Receipts to such participants, in each case, in accordance with its applicable procedures and arrangements, and (2) whenever any notice, payment or other communication to the holders of Global Registered Receipts is required under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall give all such notices, payments and communications specified herein to be given to such holders to the applicable Global Receipt Depository.
If an Exchange Event has occurred with respect to any Global Registered Receipt, then, in any such event, the Depositary shall, upon receipt of a written order from the Corporation for the execution and delivery of individual definitive registered Receipts in exchange for such Global Registered Receipt, execute and deliver, individual definitive registered Receipts, in authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Registered Receipt surrendered in exchange for such Global Registered Receipt.
Definitive registered Receipts issued in exchange for a Global Registered Receipt pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Global Receipt Depository for such Global Registered Receipt, pursuant to instructions from its participants, shall instruct the Depositary in writing. The Depositary shall deliver such Receipts to the persons in whose names such Receipts are so registered.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Deposit Agreement, should the Corporation determine that the Receipts should be issued as a Global Registered Receipt, the parties hereto shall comply with the terms of each Letter of Representations, if applicable.
 
Any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file such proof of residence, or other matters or other information, to execute such certificates and to make such representations and warranties as the Depositary or the Corporation may reasonably deem necessary or proper. The Depositary or the Corporation may withhold the delivery, or delay the registration of transfer or redemption, of any Receipt or the withdrawal of the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt or the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof until such proof or other information is filed or such certificates are executed or such representations and warranties are made.
 
Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain charges and expenses, as provided in Section 5.7. Registration of transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of Stock and all money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused until any such payment due is made, and any dividends or other distributions may be withheld or any part of or all the Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt and not theretofore sold may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder prior to such sale), and such dividends or other distributions or the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such charges or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
 
The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that the Stock, when issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (subject to 12 U.S.C.  55). Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will represent legal and valid interests in the Stock. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; provided, however, that in case the Corporation or the Depositary shall be required to withhold and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Stock an amount on account of taxes, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares shall be reduced accordingly.The Depositary shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount, however, as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Depositary Shares a fraction of one cent, and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next sum received by the Depositary for distribution to record holders of Receipts then outstanding. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with its certified tax identification number on a properly completed Form W-8 or W-9, as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding
 
sentence, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distributions to be made hereunder.
 
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or privileges upon Stock, the Depositary shall, at the direction of the Corporation, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Corporation may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. If in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such record holders in accordance with the direction of the Corporation, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Corporation or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes) the Depositary deems, after consultation with the Corporation, such distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may, with the approval of the Corporation, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, in a commercially reasonable manner. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by the Depositary to record holders of Receipts as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Corporation shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Depositary and the Depositary shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the holders of Receipts unless the Corporation shall have provided an opinion of counsel stating that such securities or property have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered in connection with such distributions.
 
If the Corporation shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names Stock is recorded on the books of the Corporation any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Corporation shall instruct the Depositary in writing, either by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Corporation; provided, however, that (i) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Depositary determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation with the Corporation) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise, or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then the Depositary, in its discretion (with approval of the Corporation, in any case where the Depositary has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges permit such transfer, sell such rights, preferences or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to
 
Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that it will file promptly a registration statement pursuant to such Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its reasonable best efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such registration statement shall have become effective, or the Corporation shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to the effect that the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
The Corporation shall notify the Depositary whether any other action under the laws of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, and the Corporation agrees with the Depositary that the Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
 
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever the Depositary and the Corporation shall decide it is appropriate, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Corporation with respect to, or otherwise in accordance with the terms of, the Stock, as identified in a written notice to the Depositary of such record date) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, or who shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate reasons.
 
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations, upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail or transmit by such other method approved by the Depositary, in its reasonable discretion, to the record holders of Receipts a notice prepared by the Corporation which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and (ii) a
 
statement that the holders may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by the Corporation) and a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. The Corporation hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Stock or cause such Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from holders of Receipts, the Depositary will vote the Series B Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts of such holders proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received from the other holders.
 
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Stock, subject to the Certificate of Designations, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Corporation or to which it is a party, the Depositary may in its discretion with the approval of, and shall upon the instructions of, the Corporation, and (in either case) in such manner as the Depositary may deem equitable, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Corporation in the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Stock and in the ratio of the Redemption Price to the Preferred Stock Redemption Price, in each case as may be necessary fully to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Stock, or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and (ii) treat any securities which shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Stock as new deposited securities so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Stock. In any such case the Depositary may in its discretion, with the approval of the Corporation, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited securities. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property and cash into which the Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
 
The Depositary shall furnish to holders of Receipts any reports and communications received from the Corporation which are received by the Depositary and which the Corporation is required to furnish to the holders of the Stock.
 
Promptly upon request from time to time by the Corporation, the Depositary shall furnish to it a list, as of the most recent practicable date, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all record holders of Receipts.
 
Upon execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary's Office, facilities for the execution and delivery, registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
The Depositary shall keep books at the Depositary's Office for the registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts; provided that any such holder requesting to exercise such right shall certify to the Depositary that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts.
The Depositary may close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Corporation may appoint a Registrar for registration of the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby. If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national stock exchanges, the Corporation will appoint a Registrar for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with any requirements of such exchange. Such Registrar (which may be the Depositary if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange) may be removed and a substitute Registrar appointed by the Depositary upon the request or with the approval of the Corporation. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Depositary will, at the request of the Corporation, arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulation.
 
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt if by reason of any provision of any present or future law, or regulation thereunder, of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Corporation's Fifth Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (including the Certificate of Designations), or by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Corporation shall be prevented or forbidden from, or subjected to any penalty on account of, doing or performing any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or the Corporation incur liability to any holder of a Receipt (i) by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement shall provide shall or may be done or performed, or (ii) by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement except as otherwise explicitly set forth in this Deposit Agreement.
 
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts other than for its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. Notwithstanding anything in this Deposit Agreement to the contrary, neither the Depositary, nor the Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be liable in any event for special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits).
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be under, any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts which in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Corporation shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reasonable reliance upon the written advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information from any person presenting Stock for deposit, any holder of a Receipt or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such information. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar and the Corporation may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon or omitting to act upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Depositary will indemnify the Corporation against any liability which may directly arise out of acts performed or omitted by the Depositary due to its gross negligence, willful
 
misconduct or bad faith, however, in no event shall the Depositary be liable for consequential, special or indirect damages of any kind regardless of whether the Depositary is put on notice of the possibility of such damages. The Depositary shall not be liable for the acts or omissions due to the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Depositary's Agent, so long as such Depositary's Agent was appointed with due care.
The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the shares of Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action is not taken in bad faith. The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Deposit Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar.
The Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, and any Registrar may own and deal in any class of securities of the Corporation and its affiliates and in Receipts. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Corporation and its affiliates.
The Depositary shall not be under any liability for interest on any monies at any time received by it pursuant to any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement or of the Receipts, the Depositary Shares or the Stock nor shall it be obligated to segregate such monies from other monies held by it, except as required by law. The Depositary shall not be responsible for advancing funds on behalf of the Corporation and shall have no duty or obligation to make any payments if it has not timely received sufficient funds to make timely payments.
In the event the Depositary believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the Depositary hereunder, or in the administration of any of the provisions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering to take any action hereunder, the Depositary may, in its sole discretion upon written notice to the Corporation, refrain from taking any action and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Corporation, any holders of Receipts or any other person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Depositary receives written instructions or a certificate signed by the Corporation which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary or which proves or establishes the applicable matter to the satisfaction of the Depositary. The Depositary shall not be liable to the Corporation or any holder of Receipts, for any action taken by it in accordance with the written instruction of the Corporation.
 
The Depositary may at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by delivering notice of its election to do so to the Corporation, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
 
The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Corporation by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary hereunder and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Corporation shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor Depositary, which shall be a bank or trust Corporation having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If no successor Depositary shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed Depositary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Depositary. Every successor Depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Corporation an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Corporation, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor, and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts and such records, books and other information in its possession relating thereto. Any successor Depositary shall promptly mail or transmit by such other method approved by such successor Depositary, in its reasonable discretion, notice of its appointment to the record holders of Receipts.
Any entity into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated or converted shall be the successor of such Depositary without the execution or filing of any document or any further act, and notice thereof shall not be required hereunder. Such successor Depositary may authenticate the Receipts in the name of the predecessor Depositary or in the name of the successor Depositary.
 
The Corporation agrees that it will deliver to the Depositary, and the Depositary will, promptly after receipt thereof, transmit to the record holders of Receipts, in each case at the addresses recorded in the Depositary's books, copies of all notices and reports (including without limitation financial statements) required by law, by the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts are listed or by the Corporation's Fifth Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (including the Certificate of Designations), to be furnished to the record holders of Receipts. Such transmission will be at the Corporation's expense and the Corporation will provide the Depositary with such number of copies of such documents as the Depositary may reasonably request. In addition, the Depositary will transmit to the record holders of Receipts at the Corporation's expense such other documents as may be requested by the Corporation.
 
Notwithstanding Section 5.3 to the contrary, the Corporation shall indemnify the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Registrar (including each of their officers, directors, agents and employees) against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, damage, cost, penalty, liability or expense (including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of defending itself) which may arise out of acts performed, suffered or omitted to be taken in connection with this Deposit Agreement and the Receipts by the Depositary, any Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depositary's Agent) and any transactions or documents contemplated hereby, except for any liability arising out of negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the respective parts of any such person or persons. The obligations of the Corporation set forth in this Section 5.6 shall survive any succession of any Depositary, Registrar or Depositary's Agent.
 
The Corporation agrees promptly to pay the Depositary the compensation to be agreed upon with the Corporation for all services rendered by the Depositary hereunder and to reimburse the Depositary for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Depositary without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part (or on the part of any Depositary's Agent) in connection with the services rendered by it (or such Depositary's Agent) hereunder. The Corporation shall pay all charges of the Depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the Stock and the initial issuance of the Depositary Shares, all withdrawals of shares of the Stock by owners of Depositary Shares, and any redemption or exchange of the Stock at the option of the Corporation. The Corporation shall pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. All other transfer and other taxes and governmental charges shall be at the expense of holders of Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts. If, at the request of a holder of Receipts, the Depositary incurs charges or expenses for which the Corporation is not otherwise liable hereunder, such holder will be liable for such charges and expenses; provided, however, that the Depositary may, at its sole option, require a holder of a Receipt to prepay the Depositary any charge or expense the Depositary has been asked to incur at the request of such holder of Receipts. The Depositary shall present its statement for charges and expenses to the Corporation at such intervals as the Corporation and the Depositary may agree.
 
The form of the Receipts and any provisions of this Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Corporation and the Depositary in any respect which they may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no such amendment which shall materially and adversely alter the rights of the holders of Receipts shall be effective unless such amendment shall have been approved by holders of Receipts representing in the aggregate at least a two-thirds majority of the Depositary Shares then
 
outstanding. Every holder of an outstanding Receipt at the time any such amendment becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the Deposit Agreement as amended thereby. In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 and Article III, of any owner of Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt evidencing such Depositary Shares to the Depositary with instructions to deliver to the holder the Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law or the rules and regulations of any governmental body, agency or commission, or applicable stock exchange.
 
This Deposit Agreement may be terminated by the Corporation at any time upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to the Depositary, in which case, at least 30 days prior to the date fixed in such notice for such termination, the Depositary will mail notice of such termination to the record holders of all Receipts then outstanding.
If any Receipts shall remain outstanding after the date of termination of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary thereafter shall discontinue the transfer of Receipts, shall suspend the distribution of dividends to the holders thereof and shall not give any further notices (other than notice of such termination) or perform any further acts under this Deposit Agreement, except that the Depositary shall continue to collect dividends and other distributions pertaining to Stock, shall sell rights, preferences or privileges as provided in this Deposit Agreement and shall deliver the number of whole or fractional shares of Stock and any money and other property, if any, represented by Receipts upon surrender thereof by the holders thereof. At any time after the expiration of two years from the date of termination, the Depositary may sell Stock then held hereunder at public or private sale, at such places and upon such terms as it deems proper and may thereafter hold the net proceeds of any such sale, together with any money and other property held by it hereunder, without liability for interest, for the benefit, pro rata in accordance with their holdings, of the holders of Receipts that have not theretofore been surrendered. After making such sale, the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement except to account for such net proceeds and money and other property; provided, that Sections 5.3 and 5.6 shall survive the termination of this Deposit Agreement.
This Deposit Agreement will terminate automatically if (i) all outstanding Depositary Shares have been redeemed pursuant to Section 2.8 or (ii) there shall have been made a final distribution in respect of the Stock in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and such distribution shall have been distributed to the holders of Depositary Shares pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, as applicable.
Upon the termination of this Deposit Agreement, the Corporation shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement except for its obligations to the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Registrar under Sections 5.6 and 5.7.
 
 
This Deposit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by each of the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Deposit Agreement by facsimile or electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Deposit Agreement.
 
This Deposit Agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors hereunder, and shall not be deemed to give any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim to any other person whatsoever.
 
In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts should be or become invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or therein shall in no way be affected, prejudiced or disturbed thereby.

Registration Statement
In connection with this opinion, we have examined the following documents: (i) the Registration Statement; (ii) the Company's Fifth Restated Certificate of Incorporation, filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on May 7, 2001, as amended by the Certificate of Designations of Fixed to Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 24, 2012; (iii) the Company's Fourth Restated Bylaws dated December 12, 2007, as amended on July 28, 2009 and January 27, 2010; (iv) the Underwriting Agreement; (v) the Deposit Agreement; (vi) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted on December 14, 2011 and May 17, 2012, and resolutions of the Pricing Committee of the Board of Directors adopted on May 30, 2012; (vii) the Certificate of Designations of the Series B Preferred Stock, filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on May 31, 2012; (viii) the minute books of the Company provided to us by one or more officers of the Company; (ix) the executed stock certificate evidencing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary; (x) the executed global depositary receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares (the ""); (xi) the written order of the Company pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, directing the Depositary to execute and deliver the Global Depositary Receipt; (xii) one or more certificates of one or more officers

of the Company; (xiii) one or more certificates of one or more officers of the Depositary; and (xiv) one or more certificates of one or more public officials.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed the legal capacity of individuals, that the signatures on all documents not executed in our presence are genuine, that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, that all documents submitted to us as reproduced or certified copies conform to the original documents, that all corporate records of the Company provided to us for review are accurate and complete, that each party to the documents referred to above (other than the Company) is duly qualified to engage in the transactions contemplated by such documents and has the requisite power and authority to perform its obligations thereunder, that each document referred to above has been duly authorized by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, each party thereto (other than the Company), enforceable against such party (other than the Company) in accordance with its terms, and that each person or entity that has any right to enforce any document referred to above against the Company has filed any tax returns and paid any taxes required under the laws of the State of California. We have further assumed the due execution and delivery of all documents, where due execution and delivery are prerequisites to the enforceability thereof.
As to matters of fact material to our opinion, we have relied solely upon our review of the documents referred to above. We have assumed that the recitals of fact set forth in such documents are true, complete and correct on the date hereof. We have not independently verified any factual matters or the validity of any assumptions made by us in this letter and express no opinion with respect to such factual matters and disclaim any implication or inference as to the reasonableness of any such assumption. In rendering this opinion, we have considered only the Delaware General Corporation Law (including the statutory provisions and reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws) and those laws, statutes, rules and regulations of the State of New York (exclusive of municipal and other local laws) presently in effect that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the kind contemplated by the documents referred to above, and we express no opinion with respect to choice of law or conflicts of law. We express no opinion whatsoever as to the compliance or noncompliance by any person with antifraud or information delivery provisions of state or federal laws, rules and regulations, and no inference regarding such compliance or noncompliance may be drawn from any opinion in this letter.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, and assuming, without expressing any opinion with respect thereto, that the Securities have been issued, sold and delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Deposit Agreement, we are of the opinion that the Depositary Shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and that the holders of the Depositary Shares are entitled to the rights specified in the Deposit Agreement and the Global Depositary Receipt.
Our opinion above, insofar as it relates to the rights of the holders of the Depositary Shares, is subject to the following:

(1) Such opinion is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws. In addition, the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief, the appointment of a receiver and other equitable remedies is subject to the discretion of the tribunal before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
(2) Notwithstanding any language of the Deposit Agreement to the contrary, indemnification of any party thereunder may be limited to recovery of only reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses. Such opinion, insofar as it relates to the enforceability of indemnification provisions set forth in the Deposit Agreement, is subject to laws and judicial decisions rendering unenforceable indemnification contrary to federal and state securities laws and the public policies underlying such laws, and laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action involves negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(3) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions of the Deposit Agreement to the extent they contain:
 
 
 
 
(4) We express no opinion as to whether courts other than state or federal courts in the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New York law governing the Deposit Agreement.
(5) Insofar as such opinion relates to the provisions of the Deposit Agreement regarding jurisdiction, service of process and venue (and the defense of an inconvenient forum), such opinion is limited to jurisdiction and service of process in respect of any action arising out of or based upon the Deposit Agreement brought, or sought to be brought, in any New York State or U.S. federal court in The City of New York. We express no opinion as to the subject matter jurisdiction of any federal court of the United States of America over any action between two parties neither of which is a "citizen" of any State for the purposes of 28 U.S.C.  1332.

No opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond what is explicitly stated in this letter. We disclaim any obligation to update the opinion rendered herein and express no opinion as to the effect of events occurring, circumstances arising, or changes of law becoming effective or occurring, after the date hereof on the matters addressed in this opinion letter, and we assume no responsibility to inform you of additional or changed facts, or changes in law, of which we may become aware.
We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K for incorporation by reference into the Registration Statement, to the use of our name therein and in the Registration Statement (including the related prospectus supplement) under the caption "Legal Matters," and to the discussion of this opinion under such caption.
