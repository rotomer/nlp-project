.
The New Notes were issued pursuant to a Senior Indenture, dated as of June 5, 2009 (the "Senior Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 27, 2012 ("Third Supplemental Indenture").

In addition, the Company has agreed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, under certain circumstances, to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC to cover resales of the New Notes. If the Company fails to satisfy these obligations, it will be required to pay additional interest as liquidated damages to the holders of the New Notes. The Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4, and the description of the Registration Rights Agreement contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.

The Company may require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b), that the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from each Electing Holder of Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and all other Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such other Electing Holders may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus (including, without limitation, any "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433) contained therein or furnished by the Company to any Electing Holder, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds received or to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) pursuant to such registration.
Indemnification by the Electing Holders
provided, however,
(c)    Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party except to the extent that the indemnifying party suffers material prejudice as a result of such failure (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses), and otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party

shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, at such time be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)    If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Electing Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.
Contribution.
(e)    The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
 
conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, each Electing Holder and each person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and the Electing Holders contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder or Electing Holder may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as well as to each officer and director of the other holders and to each person, if any, who controls such other holders within the meaning of the Securities Act.

 Underwritten Offerings
Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees with the Company and each other such holder that no holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless (a) the Company gives its prior written consent to such underwritten offering, (b) the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company, (c) each holder of Registrable Securities participating in such underwritten offering agrees to sell such holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled selecting the managing underwriter or underwriters hereunder and (d) each holder of Registrable Securities participating in such underwritten offering completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144.
(b)     The fact that holders of Registrable Securities may become eligible to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 shall not (1) cause such Securities to cease to be Registrable Securities or (2) excuse the Company's obligations set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement, including without limitation the obligations in respect of an Exchange Offer, Shelf Registration and Special Interest.
Availability of Rule 144 Not Excuse for Obligations under Section 2.

Certain legal consequences arise from being named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus. Accordingly, holders and beneficial owners of Registrable Securities are advised to consult their own securities law counsel regarding the consequences of being named or not being named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus.
The term is defined in the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement.
"Registrable Securities"
 
The undersigned holder (the ) of Registrable Securities hereby elects to include in the Shelf Registration Statement the Registrable Securities beneficially owned by it and listed below in Item (3). The undersigned, by signing and returning this Notice and Questionnaire, agrees to be bound with respect to such Registrable Securities by the terms and conditions of this Notice and Questionnaire and the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 6 of the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, as if the undersigned Selling Securityholder were an original party thereto.
"Selling Securityholder"
Pursuant to the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, the undersigned has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors [and officers] who sign any Shelf Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ), against certain losses arising out of an untrue statement, or the alleged untrue statement, of a material fact in the Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus or the omission, or alleged omission, to state a material fact required to be stated in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus, but only to the extent such untrue statement or omission, or alleged untrue statement or omission, was made in reliance on and in conformity with the information provided in this Notice and Questionnaire.
"Exchange Act"
Upon any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, the Selling Securityholder will be required to deliver to the Company and Trustee the Notice of Transfer set forth in Appendix A to the Prospectus and as Exhibit B to the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement.
The Selling Securityholder hereby provides the following information to the Company and represents and warrants that such information is accurate and complete:
 
 
Except as set forth below in this Item (4), the undersigned Selling Securityholder is not the beneficial or registered owner of any other securities of the Company, other than the Securities listed above in Item (3).
 
"Reporting Company"
If the Selling Securityholder is not an entity that is required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (a
), then the Selling Securityholder must disclose the name of the natural person(s) who exercise sole or shared dispositive powers with respect to the Securities. Selling Securityholders should disclose the beneficial holders, not nominee holders or other such others of record. In addition, the Commission has provided guidance that Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 should be used by analogy when determining the person or persons sharing voting and/or dispositive powers with respect to the Securities.
Please note that the names of the persons listed in (b) above will be included in the Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus.
 
Except as set forth below, neither the Selling Securityholder nor any of its affiliates, officers, directors or principal equity holders (5% or more) has held any position or office or has had any other material relationship with the Company (or its predecessors or affiliates) during the past three years.
Except as set forth below, the undersigned Selling Securityholder intends to distribute the Registrable Securities listed above in Item (3) only as follows (if at all): Such Registrable Securities may be sold from time to time directly by the undersigned Selling Securityholder. Such Registrable Securities may be sold in one or more transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be effected in transactions (which may involve crosses or block transactions) (i) on any national securities exchange or quotation service on which the Registered Securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, (ii) in the over-the-counter market, (iii) in transactions otherwise than on such exchanges or services or in the over-the-counter market, or (iv) through the writing of options. In connection with sales of the
 
Registrable Securities or otherwise, the Selling Securityholder may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers, which may in turn engage in short sales of the Registrable Securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Securityholder may also sell Registrable Securities short and deliver Registrable Securities to close out such short positions, or loan or pledge Registrable Securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such securities.
Note:  In no event may such method(s) of distribution take the form of an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities without the prior written agreement of the Company.
The Commission requires that all Selling Securityholders that are registered broker-dealers or affiliates of registered broker-dealers be so identified in the Shelf Registration Statement. In addition, the Commission requires that all Selling Securityholders that are registered broker-dealers be named as underwriters in the Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus, even if they did not receive the Registrable Securities as compensation for underwriting activities.
 
 
If you answered "Yes", please provide a brief description of the transaction(s) in which the Securities were acquired as compensation:
 
If the answer is "No" to Item (8)(d)(i) or "Yes" to Item (8)(d)(ii), you will be named as an underwriter in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus.
 
"An issuer filed a Form S-3 registration statement for a secondary offering of common stock which is not yet effective. One of the selling shareholders wanted to do a short sale of common stock "against the box" and cover the short sale with registered shares after the effective date. The issuer was advised that the short sale could not be made before the registration statement becomes effective, because the shares underlying the short sale are deemed to be sold at the time such sale is made. There would, therefore, be a violation of Section 5 if the shares were effectively sold prior to the effective date."
By returning this Notice and Questionnaire, the undersigned Selling Securityholder will be deemed to be aware of the foregoing interpretation.
By signing below, the Selling Securityholder acknowledges that it understands its obligation to comply, and agrees that it will comply, with the provisions of the Exchange Act, particularly Regulation M (or any successor rule or regulation).
The Selling Securityholder hereby acknowledges its obligations under the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and certain other persons as set forth in the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement.

Except as otherwise provided in the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, all notices hereunder and pursuant to the Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement shall be made in writing, by hand-delivery, first-class mail, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery as follows:
