NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
SECTION 1.01 Establishment.
There is hereby established a new series of Securities to be issued under the Indenture, to be entitled the "6.20% Senior Notes due 2018" (the "Notes"). There is to be authenticated and delivered $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes, and no further Notes shall be
 
authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1106 or the last paragraph of Section 301 of the Original Indenture; that any additional Notes authenticated and delivered as provided in the last paragraph of Section 301 of the Original Indenture shall be fungible with the original Notes for United States federal income tax purposes. The Notes shall be issued in fully registered form without coupons.
provided
The Notes, together with the endorsement of the Guarantee thereon, shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, and the form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Notes shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
Each Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof.
SECTION 1.02 Definitions.
The following defined terms used herein with respect to the Notes, shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.
"Interest Payment Dates" means each April 15 and October 15, commencing October 15, 2008.
"Original Issue Date" means April 10, 2008.
"Regular Record Date" means, with respect to each Interest Payment Date, the close of business on the April 1 and October 1, as applicable, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day).

SECTION 1.03 Payment of Principal and Interest.
The principal of the Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity (unless earlier redeemed). The unpaid principal amount of the Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 6.20% per annum until paid or duly provided for, and such interest will accrue from the Original Issue Date or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to the Person or Persons in whose name the Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such Regular Record Date and on or before such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person or Persons in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee ("Special Record Date"), notice whereof shall be given to Holders of the Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture.
 
Payments of interest on the Notes shall include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. "Business Day" means a day other than (i) a Saturday or a Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office is closed for business.
Payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Notes represented by a Global Security shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Holder of such Global Security; provided that, in the case of payments of principal and premium, if any, such Global Security is first surrendered to the Paying Agent. If any of the Notes are no longer represented by a Global Security, payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes shall be made at the office of the Paying Agent maintained for such purpose; that (i) in the case of payments of principal and premium, if any, such Notes are first surrendered to the Paying Agent; and (ii) payments of interest may be made, at the option of Spectra Capital, (A) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (B) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 16 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.

The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee.
A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only if (i) the Depositary notifies Spectra Capital that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by Spectra Capital within 90 days of receipt by Spectra Capital of such notification, or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency
 
registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by Spectra Capital within 90 days after it becomes aware of such cessation or (ii) subject to the Depositary's procedures, Spectra Capital in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.
SECTION 1.06 Guarantee of the Notes.
The Guarantor hereby agrees that the Guarantee set forth in Section 102 of the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture shall apply with respect to the Notes as if the Notes were listed on Schedule A to the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture and constituted "Notes" thereunder. The Guarantor agrees that Sections 103 and 106 of the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture shall be for the benefit of the Notes.
SECTION 1.07 Redemption at the Option of Spectra Capital.
The Notes shall be redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of Spectra Capital on any date (a "Redemption Date"), at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments thereon, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.l5(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; that if no maturity is within three months before or after the Stated Maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined, and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding such calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
provided
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if an Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by Spectra Capital.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC (and its successors), Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (and its successors), Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc.

provided, however
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by an Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to an Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for the purpose of the definition of "Remaining Scheduled Payments") by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of ascertainment thereof.
In the event that any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on such Redemption Date.
Spectra Capital shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Notes or portions of Notes to be redeemed by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
The Trustee may select for redemption Notes and portions of Notes in amounts of whole multiples of $1,000.
The Notes shall not have a sinking fund.

The Indenture also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture affecting such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

2. With respect to the Guarantee offered by the Company of the Notes issued by Spectra Energy Capital, the Guarantee is a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its respective terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), and (c) public policy considerations which may limit the rights of parties to obtain remedies.

(l) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, if any debt securities of the Spectra Entities are rated by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded such debt securities (including the Securities) and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any securities of any of the Spectra Entities.
All such opinions, certificates, letters and documents mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters and to counsel for the Underwriters.
8. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) Each of the Spectra Parties, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of any Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which that Underwriter, director, officer, employee or contesting person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state in the
 
Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Spectra Parties will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Spectra Parties by the Underwriters through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(b). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Spectra Parties may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Spectra Party, the respective directors of the Spectra Parties, the respective officers of the Spectra Parties who signed the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Spectra Parties within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Spectra Parties to the Underwriters, but only with reference to written information relating to the Underwriters furnished to the Spectra Parties by the Underwriters through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity; and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may otherwise have. The Spectra Parties acknowledge that the statements set forth in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus: (A) the names of the Underwriters, (B) the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Notes and (C) under the heading "Underwriting," (1) the sentence relating to concessions in the second paragraph under the heading "Commissions and Expenses," (2) the second sentence in the third paragraph under the heading "Commissions and Expenses," and (3) the fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs under the heading "Commissions and Expenses," constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantive rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is
 
sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of this paragraph (c), the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not contain any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Spectra Parties and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively, the "") to which the Spectra Parties and the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Spectra Parties on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall (i) any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price of the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. If the allocation provided by the immediately
Losses
 
preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Spectra Parties and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Spectra Parties on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Spectra Parties shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Spectra Parties on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Spectra Parties and each of the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of any Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters, and each person who controls the Spectra Parties within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Spectra Parties who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Spectra Parties shall have the same rights to contribution as the Spectra Parties, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . Each Spectra Party hereby acknowledges that each Underwriter is acting solely as an underwriter in connection with the purchase and sale of the Securities. Each Spectra Party further acknowledges that each Underwriter is acting pursuant to a contractual relationship created solely by this Agreement entered into on an arm's-length basis and in no event do the parties intend that each Underwriter acts or be responsible as a fiduciary or financial advisor to any of the Spectra Entities, their management, unitholders, creditors or any other person in connection with any activity that each Underwriter may undertake or have undertaken in furtherance of the purchase and sale of the Securities, either before or after the date hereof. Each Underwriter hereby expressly disclaims any fiduciary, agency, advisory or similar obligations to any of the Spectra Entities, either in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions, and Spectra Parties hereby confirm their understanding and agreement to that effect. The Spectra Parties and the Underwriters agree that they are each responsible for making their own independent judgments with respect to any such transactions and that any opinions or views expressed by the Underwriters to any of the Spectra Entities regarding such transactions, including but not limited to any opinions or views with respect to the price or market for the Securities, do not constitute advice or recommendations to any of the Spectra Entities. Each Spectra Party hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that any Spectra Party may have against each Underwriter with respect to any breach or alleged breach of any fiduciary, agency, advisory or similar duty to any of the Spectra Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters leading up to such transactions.
No Fiduciary Duty
 
10.. If, on the Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the principal amount of the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in hereto; provided, however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes on the Delivery Date if the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on the Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes that it agreed to purchase on the Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on the Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on the Delivery Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriters or the Spectra Parties, except that the Spectra Parties will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 12. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Notes that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

If other Underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Spectra Parties may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Spectra Parties or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
11. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by Spectra Energy prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(j), 7(k) or 7(l) shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof by reason of the default of one or more of the Underwriters, the Spectra Parties shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of such Underwriter's expenses.
13. . Each of the Spectra Parties acknowledges that the Underwriters' research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters' research analysts may hold views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to each of the Spectra Parties and/or the offering that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions. Each of the Spectra Parties hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Spectra Parties may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Spectra Parties by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions. Each of the Spectra Parties acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Research Analyst Independence

Each Underwriter severally agrees that such Underwriter, without the prior written consent of Spectra Energy, has not used or referred to publicly and shall not use or refer to publicly any "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Spectra Parties with the Commission or retained by the Spectra Parties under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) of this Agreement; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in hereto and any electronic road show. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Spectra Parties is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Spectra Parties agree that (x) they have treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) they have complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
