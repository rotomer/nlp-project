Spectra Energy Corp (NYSE: SE) today reported 2008 net income of $1.13 billion, or $1.81 diluted earnings per share (EPS), an increase from $957 million, $1.51 EPS, in 2007. Ongoing 2008 net income was $1.14 billion, or $1.83 EPS, compared with $965 million, $1.52 EPS, in the prior year.
HOUSTON 
The annual results reflect strong earnings and sound operating performance from all underlying businesses. The company benefited from expansion projects placed into service in both 2007 and 2008 and higher commodity prices during the year.
"We delivered excellent financial results, executed extremely well on the completion of a record $1.8 billion in new projects and increased our dividend 14 percent during the year," said Greg Ebel, president and chief executive officer, Spectra Energy Corp. "We also took some key, proactive steps to ensure we are well positioned to manage current economic challenges."
The company reported 2008 fourth quarter net income of $171 million, or $0.28 diluted EPS, compared with $291 million, $0.46 diluted EPS, in the prior year quarter. After removing the effect of the impairment of the company's investment in the Islander East project, ongoing net income for the 2008 quarter was $197 million, or $0.32 EPS, versus $296 million, or $0.47 EPS, in the 2007 quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower commodity prices and a lower Canadian dollar.
SEGMENT RESULTS
U.S. Transmission
U.S. Transmission reported fourth quarter 2008 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $161 million, compared with $221 million in fourth quarter 2007. The decrease includes a $44 million special item for an impairment of the Islander East project caused by adverse legal rulings and unfavorable economic conditions.
 
Excluding the above special item, ongoing EBIT for fourth quarter 2008 was $205 million, compared with $221 million in the prior year quarter. The segment benefited from higher EBIT from business expansion projects during the 2008 period. The increase in earnings was offset by lower processing revenues, resulting from lower volumes and prices, and higher development costs associated with ongoing pipeline and storage expansion projects.
Year-end reported EBIT for U.S. Transmission was $844 million, compared with $894 million in 2007.
Distribution
Distribution reported fourth quarter 2008 EBIT of $90 million, compared with $84 million in fourth quarter 2007. These improved results reflect the continued increase in storage and transportation revenues, lower operating costs and increased customer usage as a result of colder weather, which was 13 percent colder than the 2007 quarter. The improvements were partially offset by a weaker Canadian dollar and earnings sharing with customers related to the incentive regulation framework implemented in 2008.
Year-end EBIT for Distribution was $353 million, compared with $322 million in 2007.
Western Canada Transmission & Processing
Western Canada Transmission & Processing reported fourth quarter 2008 EBIT of $65 million, compared with $141 million in fourth quarter 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from lower frac spreads at the Empress operations and a weaker Canadian dollar.
Year-end EBIT for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $398 million, compared with $359 million in 2007.
Field Services
Field Services reported fourth quarter 2008 EBIT of $69 million, compared with $188 million in fourth quarter 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by lower natural gas
 
liquids (NGL) prices, which correlate to lower crude oil prices. Crude oil averaged $59 per barrel in fourth quarter 2008 versus $91 per barrel during the same period in 2007. In addition, the NGL to crude oil relationship decreased quarter over quarter, from 65 percent to 46 percent. The decrease from NGL prices was partially offset by non-cash mark-to-market gains compared with mark-to-market losses in fourth quarter 2007, both from hedges used to protect distributable cash flow at DCP Midstream's master limited partnership.
For the quarter, DCP Midstream paid distributions of $105 million to Spectra Energy.
Year-end reported EBIT for Field Services was $716 million, compared with $533 million in 2007.
Other
"Other" reported net costs of $21 million in fourth quarter 2008, compared with $56 million reported in fourth quarter 2007, which included $7 million of costs to achieve the launch of Spectra Energy. Excluding these, net corporate costs were $28 million lower in fourth quarter 2008, reflecting lower general corporate and benefits costs.
Year-end reported net costs for "Other" were $78 million, compared with $112 million in 2007.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $166 million for both the 2008 and 2007 fourth quarters. Interest on higher debt balances in 2008 was offset by lower interest rates and the effects of a lower Canadian dollar.
Interest expense for 2008 was $636 million compared with $633 million in 2007.
Income Taxes
Fourth quarter 2008 income tax expense from continuing operations was $43 million, compared with $128 million reported in fourth quarter 2007. The effective tax rate was 20 percent in fourth quarter 2008, compared with 31 percent in the prior year quarter.
 
The lower tax rate this quarter was primarily due to favorable adjustments in 2008 for final 2007 tax returns and lower 2008 state income taxes.
The annual effective tax rate for 2008 was 31 percent compared with 32 percent in 2007.
 
 
 
 
2009 Outlook
"Despite the current economic conditions, we begin the year in a strong position and expect to end the year strong," said Ebel.
"While we are not immune to today's market volatility, our strength permits us to continue completing our ongoing expansion plans and growing our core transmission, storage and distribution earnings over the long term," he said. "With our commitment to maintain our financial flexibility and investment-grade balance sheet, we are positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may come our way this year."

Investors Section
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Spectra Energy's management uses ongoing net income and ongoing diluted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as they represent net income and diluted EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for special items, as measures to evaluate operations of the company. Special items represent certain charges and credits which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis. Management believes that the presentation of ongoing net income and ongoing diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it allows them to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods. Ongoing diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses.
The primary performance measure used by management to evaluate segment performance is segment EBIT from continuing operations, which at the segment level represents all profits from continuing operations (both operating and non-operating) before deducting interest and taxes, and is net of the minority interest expense related to those earnings. Management considers segment EBIT from continuing operations, which is the GAAP measure used to report segment results, to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance as it represents the results of our ownership interests in operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures.
Spectra Energy also uses ongoing segment and Other EBIT as a measure of performance. Ongoing segment and Other EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents reported segment and Other EBIT adjusted for special items. Management believes that the presentation of ongoing segment and Other EBIT provides useful information to investors, as it allows them to more accurately compare a segment's or Other's ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing segment or Other EBIT is reported segment or Other EBIT, which represents EBIT from continuing operations, including any special items.
 
Spectra Energy uses Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) as a measure of the profitability of capital projects. ROCE is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. ROCE as it relates to capital expansion projects is calculated by Spectra Energy as earnings before interest and taxes generated by a project divided by the total cost of a project.
