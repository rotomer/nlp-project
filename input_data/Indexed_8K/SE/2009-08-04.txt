Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Spectra Energy Corp (NYSE: SE) today reported 2009 second quarter net income from controlling interests of $140 million, or $0.22 diluted earnings per share (EPS), compared with $295 million, $0.47 diluted EPS, in the prior year quarter.
HOUSTON 
"We had a good quarter, delivering solid results squarely in line with our expectations," said Greg Ebel, president and chief executive officer, Spectra Energy Corp.
"Our core, fee-based businesses  which will provide the overwhelming majority of this year's earnings  performed well during the quarter, helping to offset the effects of much lower commodity prices and a weaker Canadian dollar," he said. "We also have placed key projects into service in both the U.S. and Canada that will provide significant earnings and cash flow. And, our remaining 2009 projects are on track for successful completion."
 
"With more than a billion dollars in operating cash flow, substantial cash on the balance sheet, more than $2.5 billion of available liquidity and lower-than-anticipated debt balances, we are very well positioned to continue executing on our growth plan," continued Ebel.
SEGMENT RESULTS
U.S. Transmission
U.S. Transmission reported second quarter 2009 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $234 million, compared with $244 million in second quarter 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $31 million special item related to a customer bankruptcy settlement in 2008.
Excluding the above special item, ongoing EBIT for second quarter was $234 million, compared with $213 million in the prior year quarter. The segment benefited from business expansion projects and lower project development costs during the quarter. These earnings were partially offset by lower gas processing revenues as a result of lower prices and volumes, and lower equity earnings.
Distribution
Distribution reported second quarter 2009 EBIT of $40 million, compared with $54 million in second quarter 2008. Excluding the $8 million effect of the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar and an $11 million charge to reflect a settlement on prior year earnings to be shared with customers, earnings would have increased $5 million this quarter. The segment continued to benefit from higher storage and transportation revenues.
Western Canada Transmission & Processing
Western Canada Transmission & Processing reported second quarter 2009 EBIT of $58 million, compared with $91 million during second quarter 2008. Excluding the $10 million effect of the weaker Canadian dollar, earnings were $23 million lower than the prior year period. Improved results in the base gathering and processing business, due
 
primarily to stronger activity in the Fort Nelson and Grizzly Valley areas, were more than offset by lower Empress earnings, primarily as a result of lower frac spreads.
Field Services
Field Services reported second quarter 2009 EBIT of $24 million, compared with $216 million in second quarter 2008. The decrease in earnings was primarily driven by lower commodity prices. During second quarter 2009 crude oil averaged approximately $60 per barrel compared with $124 per barrel in the prior year quarter and NYMEX natural gas averaged $3.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) compared with approximately $11 per MMBtu during the same period in 2008.
The decline in commodity prices was partially offset by lower operating costs as a result of successful cost reduction initiatives, and lower losses on non-cash mark-to-market hedges used to protect distributable cash flow at DCP Midstream's master limited partnership.
Other
"Other" reported net costs of $12 million in second quarter 2009, compared with net costs of $28 million in second quarter 2008.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $146 million for second quarter 2009, compared with $149 million for second quarter 2008. This decrease is primarily from the effects of the weaker Canadian dollar, offset by higher long-term debt balances.
Income Taxes
Second quarter 2009 income tax expense from continuing operations was $67 million, compared with $136 million reported in second quarter 2008. The decrease was primarily as a result of lower earnings in 2009. The effective tax rate was 30 percent in both quarters.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use ongoing net income and ongoing diluted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as they represent net income (controlling interests) and diluted EPS from continuing operations, adjusted for special items, as measures to evaluate operations of the company. Special items represent certain charges and credits which we believe will not be recurring on a regular basis. We believe that the presentation of ongoing net income and ongoing diluted EPS provide useful information to investors, as it allows them to more accurately compare our ongoing performance across periods. Ongoing diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses.
The primary performance measure used by us to evaluate segment performance is segment EBIT from continuing operations, which at the segment level represents all profits from continuing operations (both operating and non-operating) before deducting interest and taxes, and is net of non-controlling interests related to those profits. We consider segment EBIT from continuing operations, which is the GAAP measure used to report segment results, to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance as it represents the results of our ownership interests in operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures.
We also use ongoing segment and Other EBIT as a measure of performance. Ongoing segment and Other EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents reported segment and Other EBIT adjusted for special items. We believe that the presentation of ongoing segment and Other EBIT provide useful information to investors, as it allows them to more accurately compare a segment's or Other's ongoing performance across
 
periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing segment or Other EBIT is reported segment or Other EBIT, which represents EBIT from continuing operations, including any special items.
Forward-Looking Statements
This release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events. One can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words such as: may, will, could, project, believe, expect, estimate, continue, potential, plan, forecast and other similar words. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. Those factors include: the implementation of state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an effect on rate structure, and affect the speed at and degree to which competition enters the natural gas industries; the outcome of litigation and regulatory investigations, proceedings or inquiries; the effect of weather and other natural phenomena, including the economic, operational and other effects of hurricanes and storms; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including our credit ratings and general economic conditions; the levels of supply and demand for natural gas in our areas of operation; the results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings and general market and economic conditions; increases in the cost of goods and services required to complete capital projects; declines in the market prices of equity and debt securities and resulting funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans; the effects of accounting pronouncements issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; the extent of success in connecting natural gas supplies to gathering, processing and transmission systems and in connecting to expanding gas markets; our ability to identify opportunities for our business units and the timing and success of efforts to develop pipeline, storage, gathering, processing and other infrastructure
 
projects; and our ability to successfully complete and integrate future acquisitions. These factors, as well as additional factors that could affect our forward-looking statements, are described under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" in our 2008 Form 10-K, filed on February 27, 2009, and in our other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which are available via the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov.
