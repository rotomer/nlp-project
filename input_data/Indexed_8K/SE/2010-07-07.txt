On July 2, 2010, Westcoast Energy Inc. (Westcoast), a subsidiary of Spectra Energy Corp, issued 250 million Canadian dollars (approximately $235 million) aggregate principal amount of its 4.57% Medium Term Notes due 2020 (the Notes). The Notes were offered only in Canada under a short form shelf prospectus pursuant to Canadian securities laws. The net proceeds of the offering will be used for general corporate purposes.
The Notes were issued pursuant to a supplement, dated July 2, 2010, to an indenture, dated April 1, 1973, between Westcoast and Computershare Trust Company of Canada as trustee (the Indenture). Interest on the Notes will accrue from July 2, 2010. Westcoast will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on January 2 and July 2 of each year, beginning on January 2, 2011, until the Notes mature on July 2, 2020. Westcoast may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of Westcoast to, among other things, incur additional debt, create liens on or sell its principal assets or merge with other entities.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: July 7, 2010
