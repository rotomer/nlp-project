On September 6, 2011, Spectra Energy Corp ("Spectra Energy") and Spectra Energy's wholly-owned subsidiaries Spectra Energy DEFS Holding, LLC and Spectra Energy DEFS Holding Corp (Spectra Energy DEFS Holding Corp, collectively with Spectra Energy DEFS Holding, LLC, the "Spectra Member") entered into an Acknowledgement and Waiver Agreement (the "Acknowledgement and Waiver Agreement") with ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Gas Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips (the "COP Member"), which relates to the COP Member's and the Spectra Member's co-ownership of DCP Midstream, LLC ("DCP Midstream").
Under the Acknowledgement and Waiver Agreement, Spectra Energy and the Spectra Member acknowledged and confirmed that if ConocoPhillips effects a tax-free spin-off of certain of its businesses to its stockholders, and in connection with such spin-off, ConocoPhillips seeks to transfer, prior to the spin-off, all of its equity interest in the COP Member or the COP Member's 50% interest in DCP Midstream to a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips to be spun-off (or a wholly-owned subsidiary of such entity), such transfer will be permitted subject to certain requirements applicable to transfers of interests in DCP Midstream to affiliates of the COP Member contained in the limited liability company agreement of DCP Midstream. In addition, under the Acknowledgement and Waiver Agreement, Spectra Energy and the Spectra Member waived their right to purchase the COP Member's interest in DCP Midstream that would otherwise be applicable to the spin-off pursuant to a change in control provision in the limited liability company agreement of DCP Midstream.
The disclosure in this Item 1.01 is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Acknowledgement and Waiver Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Spin-off
WHEREAS, if ConocoPhillips effects the Spin-off, ConocoPhillips intends to (i) have all of the Equity Interest in the COP Member transferred to SpinCo or a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo or (ii) have all of the Company Interest owned by the COP Member transferred to SpinCo or a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo; and
WHEREAS, in connection with the foregoing, ConocoPhillips, the COP Member, Spectra and the Spectra Member have determined to enter into this Agreement.
NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1. Each of Spectra and the Spectra Member hereby acknowledges and confirms that, if ConocoPhillips determines to effect the Spin-off, any transfers, prior to the consummation of the Spin-off, of:
(i) all of the Equity Interest in the COP Member to SpinCo, or a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo, would be permitted under Article V (Liquidity and Transfer Restrictions) of the LLC Agreement as long as (1) ConocoPhillips Controls SpinCo, or such wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo, respectively, at the time of such transfer, and (2) the terms and conditions set forth in Section 5.5 (Void Transfers) of the LLC Agreement are complied with in connection with such transfer; and
(ii) all or a portion of the Company Interest owned by the COP Member to SpinCo, or a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo, would be permitted under Article V (Liquidity and Transfer Restrictions) of the LLC Agreement as long as (1) ConocoPhillips Controls SpinCo, or such wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo, respectively, at the time of such transfer, and (2) the terms and conditions set forth in Section 5.4 (Transfers to Wholly Owned Subsidiaries) and Section 5.5 (Void Transfers) of the LLC Agreement are complied with in connection with such transfer.
2. Each of Spectra and the Spectra Member hereby waives any right to purchase the COP Member's Company Interest pursuant to Section 5.3 (Change of Control) of the LLC Agreement that would otherwise be applicable as a result of ConocoPhillips effecting the Spin-off. For the absence of doubt, the parties hereto agree that (i) the waivers granted by Spectra and the Spectra Member in this Section 2 shall have no effect on the COP Member's obligations under Section 5.5 (Void Transfers) of the LLC Agreement, and (ii) neither Spectra nor the Spectra Member waives any rights under Section 5.5 (Void Transfers) of the LLC Agreement.
3. The parties hereto agree that neither this Agreement, nor any of the terms or conditions contained herein, shall constitute confidential information of the Company, Spectra, the Spectra Member, ConocoPhillips, the COP Member, or any of their respective Affiliates under Section 4.3 (Confidentiality) of the LLC Agreement or any other confidentiality agreement between Spectra or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and ConocoPhillips or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand.
4. Following the consummation of the Spin-off, provided that SpinCo then directly or indirectly owns all of the Company Interest currently owned by the COP Member, the parties hereto shall cause the LLC Agreement to be amended to replace references to ConocoPhillips (and if necessary ConocoPhillips Gas Company) with references to SpinCo (and if necessary the relevant wholly-owned subsidiary of SpinCo), as appropriate.
5. The parties agree that, from time to time, each of them will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such further agreements and instruments and take such other action as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions, purposes, and intents of this Agreement.
 
6. This Agreement shall be governed by and be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
7. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and electronically by pdf and in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered (including by facsimile and electronically by pdf) to the other parties hereto.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Acknowledgement and Waiver Agreement to be duly executed and delivered, all as of the date first set forth above.
