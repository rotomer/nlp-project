"Spectra Energy had a good quarter, despite lower commodity prices and record warm weather. Our business plan and strategy remain solidly on track, and we continue to execute well on our capital expansion projects," said Greg Ebel, president and chief executive officer, Spectra Energy Corp.
"Our diversified portfolio and first- and last-mile advantage, when combined with unprecedented natural gas infrastructure fundamentals, give us confidence in our ability to deliver earnings that will allow us to grow our dividend through all market cycles," said Ebel.
SEGMENT RESULTS
U.S. Transmission
U.S. Transmission reported first quarter 2012 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $271 million, compared with $279 million in first quarter 2011. The 2012 quarter results reflect lower interruptible transportation revenues, the effects of expected contract reductions at Ozark Gas Transmission, LLC, and accelerated software amortization costs. These results were partially offset by expansion projects previously placed into service.
Distribution
Distribution reported first quarter 2012 EBIT of $151 million, compared with $167 million in first quarter 2011. This decrease is mainly due to lower customer usage as a result of record-level warm winter weather. Lower operating fuel costs partially offset the revenue decrease.
Western Canada Transmission & Processing
Western Canada Transmission & Processing reported first quarter 2012 EBIT of $138 million, compared with $141 million in first quarter 2011. The segment experienced improved results in the gathering and processing business, primarily driven by higher revenue from expansions in the Horn River area of British Columbia. These results were offset by lower earnings at the Empress natural gas liquids (NGL) business, attributable mainly to lower NGL margins.
Field Services
Field Services reported first quarter 2012 EBIT of $93 million, compared with $81 million in first quarter 2011. The increase in EBIT was mainly driven by the effect of higher volumes from expansion projects and the absence of severe weather, which restricted volumes in the 2011 quarter. This was partially offset by lower commodity prices.
During the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, NGL prices averaged $1.00 per gallon versus $1.13 per gallon, NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.74 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) versus $4.11 per MMBtu, and crude oil averaged approximately $103 per barrel versus approximately $94 per barrel.
DCP Midstream paid distributions of $89 million to Spectra Energy in first quarter 2012.
 
Other
"Other" reported net costs of $29 million and $24 million in the first quarter 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other is primarily comprised of corporate costs, including benefits and captive insurance.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $157 million for first quarter 2012, compared with $155 million for first quarter 2011.
Income Taxes
First quarter 2012 income tax expense from continuing operations was $137 million, compared with $139 million reported in the first quarter of 2011. The lower tax expense was driven by lower earnings. The effective tax rate was 28 percent in first quarter 2012, compared with 27 percent in the prior year quarter.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use ongoing net income from controlling interests and ongoing diluted EPS as measures to evaluate operations of the company. These measures are non-GAAP financial measures as they represent net income from controlling interests and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items and discontinued operations. Special items represent certain charges and credits which we believe will not be recurring on a regular basis, and discontinued operations do not represent our ongoing core business. We believe that the presentation of ongoing net income and ongoing diluted EPS provide useful information to investors, as it allows them to more accurately compare our ongoing performance across periods.
The primary performance measure used by us to evaluate segment performance is segment EBIT from continuing operations, which at the segment level represents earnings from continuing operations (both operating and non-operating) before interest and taxes, net of noncontrolling interests related to those earnings. We consider segment EBIT, which is the GAAP measure used to report segment results, to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance from its continuing operations as it represents the results of our ownership interest in operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures.
We also use ongoing segment EBIT and Other EBIT (net costs) as measures of performance. Ongoing segment and Other EBIT are non-GAAP financial measures as they represent reported segment and Other EBIT adjusted for special items. We believe that the presentation of ongoing segment and Other EBIT provide useful information to investors, as they allow investors to more accurately compare a segment's or Other's ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for ongoing segment or Other EBIT are reported segment or Other EBIT, which represent EBIT from continuing operations, including any special items.
