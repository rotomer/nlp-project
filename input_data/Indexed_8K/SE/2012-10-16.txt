Item 8.01. Other Events.
Spectra Energy Corp (also referred to as "we" and "our") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to reflect the retrospective adoption of a new accounting pronouncement with respect to the financial information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (our 2011 Form 10-K).
We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, (ASU 2011-05), effective January 1, 2012. ASU 2011-05 amended Accounting Standards Codification Topic 220, and eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. This accounting pronouncement allows an entity an option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. We elected to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate, but consecutive, statements.
Presentation of Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive Income,
The following presents the retrospective application of ASU 2011-05 for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in our 2011 Form 10-K.
