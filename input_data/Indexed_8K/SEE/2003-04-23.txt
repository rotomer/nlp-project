Press Release of Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company"), dated April 23, 2003, disclosing the Company's financial results for the first quarter of 2003.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
SADDLE BROOK, N.J., Wednesday, April 23, 2003  Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) reported today diluted earnings per common share of $0.52 for the first quarter of 2003.
 
The conversion of the Company's outstanding preferred stock is not considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive in the quarter.  However, if earnings per share were calculated as if the Company's outstanding preferred stock had been converted into common stock, earnings per common share would have been $0.53, which is in line with expectations.  Please see the Supplementary Information below for a calculation of the "as if converted" earnings per common share compared to the diluted earnings per common share calculated using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
 
Commenting on the Company's operating performance in the quarter, William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:
 
"Sealed Air achieved solid growth in net sales and earnings in line with expectations in the first quarter despite very challenging global economic conditions.  Excluding the positive effects of foreign currency translation, both of Sealed Air's business segments achieved our targeted mid-single digit growth in net sales.  Cost increases of more than 40% in certain petrochemical-based raw materials dampened gross profit in the first quarter, but we expect margins to return to more normal levels as we move through the year.  Lastly, we maintained marketing, administrative and development expenses within our expected range of 16% to 17% of net sales."
 
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Mr. Hickey stated:
 
"As always, Sealed Air remains focused on customers as our highest priority, and we continue to benefit from our strategic priorities of innovation and continuous improvement.  Despite persistent weakness in the global economy, we are driving growth through innovative new products and applications for both new and existing customers. 
We maintain our commitment to support the growing needs of our customers around the world through investment in new operations in Malaysia and
capital expenditures approved for new production facilities in the U.S. and Eastern Europe.  These focused efforts position us well for an eventual upturn in the economy.
 
"Including the proceeds from our recent offering of senior notes, we have the funds available for a portion of the required cash payment to be made in connection with the Company's asbestos litigation settlement.  We expect to use our excess cash and strong operating cash flow to continue to invest in our business, and we may also repurchase convertible preferred stock on an opportunistic basis."
 
Given the new regulations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures, the Company will no longer be issuing guidance based on an "as if converted" earnings per common share calculation.  Going forward, Sealed Air's diluted earnings per common share on a U.S. GAAP basis for 2003 are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45.  This assumes continuing global economic recovery, a modest improvement in gross margins resulting from higher selling prices and gradual abatement of resin costs, maintenance of the first quarter effective tax rate for the remainder of the year, holding the cash proceeds from our recent bond offering, and stable foreign currency through the end of the year.
 
Company and Segment Sales for the First Quarter
 
 - 
                 
Net sales increased 10% to $822,886,000 compared to $746,087,000 for the first quarter of 2002.  The increase in net sales was primarily due to the favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, higher unit volumes for certain products.  Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of $43,277,000 in the quarter.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 4%.
 
 - 
                 
Net sales of the food packaging segment increased 10% to $498,168,000 compared to $454,914,000 in 2002.  The increase in net sales was primarily due to the favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, higher unit volumes for certain products and favorable changes in product price/mix.  Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $26,783,000 in the quarter.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales for this segment would have increased 4%.
 
 - 
                 
Net sales of the protective and specialty packaging segment increased 12% to $324,718,000 compared to $291,173,000 in 2002.  The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher unit volumes for certain products and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, the added net sales of acquired businesses, partially offset by unfavorable changes in product price/mix.  Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $16,494,000 in the quarter.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales for this segment would have increased 6%.
Financial Highlights for the First Quarter
 
 - 
                 
Gross profit was $259,451,000 or 31.5% of net sales compared to $250,642,000 or 33.6% of net sales for the first quarter of 2002.  This decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased petrochemical-based raw materials costs.
 
 - 
                 
Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased to $138,663,000 compared to $127,790,000 for the first quarter of 2002.  As a percentage of net sales, these expenses were 16.9% compared to 17.1% in the first quarter of 2002.
 
 - 
                 
Operating profit was $120,788,000 or 14.7% of net sales compared to $122,852,000 or 16.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2002.
 
 - 
                 
Interest expense increased to $22,363,000 compared to $16,717,000 in 2002 primarily due to accrued interest of $7,047,000 on the cash portion of the asbestos settlement described below.
 
 - 
                 
Other expense, net, was $529,000 in 2003 compared to $2,816,000 in 2002.  The change was primarily due to a decrease in net foreign exchange losses during the first quarter of 2003.
 
 - 
                 
The Company's effective tax rate was 37.0% compared to 41.4% for the first quarter of 2002.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to improved tax efficiency resulting from a recent reorganization of the Company's international subsidiaries.
 
Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs
 
In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against it and its affiliates in connection with the 1998 transaction in which the Cryovac packaging business of W.R. Grace was combined with Sealed Air.  The settlement calls for payment by the Company of 9 million shares of Sealed Air common stock and $512,500,000 in cash, plus interest at a 5.5% annual rate starting on December 21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of the W.R. Grace plan of reorganization.  The payment must be made in full at that time.  The Company continues to make progress on a definitive settlement agreement consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle.
