Sealed Air Reports 10% Sales Growth Leading to Record Sales for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2003
 
SADDLE BROOK, N.J., Wednesday, January 28, 2004  Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) reported diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter of 2003 of $0.50, which included a $0.22 per common share charge resulting from the Company's previously-announced repurchase of a portion of its outstanding long-term debt during the quarter.  Diluted losses per common share were $6.13 in the fourth quarter of 2002 reflecting the Company's asbestos settlement and related costs discussed below.
 
Diluted earnings per common share for the full year 2003 were $2.00, which includes the above-mentioned $0.22 per common share charge as well as a $0.26 per common share charge resulting from the Company's previously-announced third quarter redemption of its Series A convertible preferred stock offset by a modest gain on preferred stock repurchases during the first half of 2003.  Diluted losses per common share were $4.30 for the full year 2002 reflecting the Company's asbestos settlement and related costs discussed below.
 
Commenting on the Company's operating performance, William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:
 
"The strength of our business, particularly our international businesses, helped Sealed Air achieve diluted earnings per share in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year 2003.  Although the effect of foreign currency translation was a significant factor in our revenue growth, sales volumes in our international businesses grew 4% in the quarter.
 
"For the year, we improved our capital structure by redeeming our Series A convertible preferred stock in the third quarter.  In addition, we used our significant cash position to reduce debt by approximately $217 million in the fourth quarter, primarily by repurchasing a portion of our outstanding debt.  We expect to continue using our strong cash flows to provide for the future growth and added value of Sealed Air's businesses."
 
Sales for the Fourth Quarter
 
Net sales increased 10% to $934.8 million compared to $846.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2002.  The increase in net sales was due to the $60.3 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in product price/mix and higher unit volumes.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 3%.

Net sales of the food packaging segment increased 11% to $580.0 million compared to $521.8 million in 2002.  The increase in net sales was due to the $41.8 million favorable

effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, higher unit volumes and favorable changes in product price/mix.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales for this segment would have increased 3%.
 
Net sales of the protective and specialty packaging segment increased 9% to $354.8 million compared to $324.3 million in 2002.  The increase in net sales was due to the $18.5 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in product price/mix. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales for this segment would have increased 4%.

Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter
 
Gross profit was $294.9 million or 31.5% of net sales compared to $282.9 million or 33.4% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2002.  The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased petrochemical-based raw material costs.
 - 
                 
 
Marketing, administrative and development expenses were $147.7 million compared to $146.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2002.  As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 15.8% compared to 17.3% in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decrease in these expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to continued control of costs and the completion of certain corporate projects in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 - 
                 
 
Operating profit was $147.7 million or 15.8% of net sales compared to $136.2 million or 16.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 - 
                 
 
Interest expense increased to $42.9 million compared to $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 primarily due to $16.3 million of interest expense from the Company's issuance of approximately $1.3 billion of senior notes and convertible senior notes in July 2003, additional accrued interest of $6.2 million on the cash portion of the previously-reported asbestos settlement and $3.3 million of interest expense from the Company's issuance in April 2003 of $300.0 million of senior notes.
 - 
                 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased in the open market $122.5 million face amount of its 8.75% senior notes due July 2008 and $50.0 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009.  The Company made these repurchases at a premium to the face amount, contributing to a loss on debt repurchase of $33.6 million.
 - 
                 
 
Asbestos settlement and related costs were $0.3 million compared to $841.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.  In the 2002 period, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against it and its affiliates in connection with the 1998 transaction in which the Cryovac packaging business of W. R. Grace was combined with Sealed Air.  The parties signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle.  The charges for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 were for legal and related fees.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the charges reflected accruals for the cash and stock settlement expenses, as well as legal and related fees.

The Company's effective tax rate was approximately 35.0% compared to a benefit of 29.9% in 2002.  The Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2003 was 36.5%.  The decrease in the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2003 was due to the U.S. tax benefit
 - 
                 
associated with the loss on the debt repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The Company expects an effective tax rate of approximately 36.0% for 2004.  The tax benefit in 2002 resulted from the above-mentioned asbestos settlement and related costs.
 
Sales and Net Earnings for the Full Year 2003
 
Net sales increased 10% to $3,531.9 million compared to $3,204.3 million for 2002.  The increase in net sales was due to the $189.5 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in product price/mix and higher unit volumes.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 4%.
 - 
                 
 
Net sales of the food packaging segment increased 12% to $2,185.7 million compared to $1,958.1 million in 2002.  The increase in net sales was due to the $125.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, higher unit volumes and favorable changes in product price/mix.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales for this segment would have increased 5%.
 - 
                 
 
Net sales of the protective and specialty packaging segment increased 8% to $1,346.2 million compared to $1,246.2 million in 2002.

Financial Highlights for the Full Year 2003
 
A reconciliation of the previously expected diluted earnings per common share range to the reported diluted earnings per common share for the full year 2003 is set forth below:
 
 
Represents the $1 per share premium over the $50 per share book value of the Series A convertible preferred stock that the Company incurred upon the redemption in the third quarter of 2003 offset by a modest gain on preferred stock repurchases during the first half
(1)
           
of 2003.  The net charge to shareholders' equity on the redemption and repurchase of the Series A convertible preferred stock was $24.7 million in 2003.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased in the open market $122.5 million face amount of its 8.75% senior notes due July 2008 and $50.0 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009.  Such repurchases were at a premium to the face amount.
(2)
           
 
Represents the estimated net impact for the full year 2003 from the elimination of the convertible preferred stock dividends beginning July 18, 2003 through the end of the year, offset by the after tax interest expense, including the amortization of capitalized issuance costs, that was incurred as a result of the July 2003 note issuances.
(3)
           
 
The revised expected diluted earnings per common share range is presented on a fully diluted basis under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  This range does not reflect the assumed conversion of outstanding preferred stock prior to July 18, 2003 since such conversion would have been anti-dilutive.
(4)
           
 
Outlook
 
 Sealed Air anticipates diluted earnings per common share for 2004 in the range of $2.80 to $2.90.  This assumes a continued recovery in the global economy, stable petrochemical-related costs through the year, and no adverse developments in our customers' business or market conditions.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
Some of the statements made by the Company in this press release are forward-looking.  These statements include comments as to future events and trends affecting the Company's
business, which are based upon management's current expectations and are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "will" and similar expressions.  Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to a number of factors, such as changes in economic, political, business and market conditions, factors affecting customers, the effects of animal and food-related health issues, interest and exchange rates, the success of new products, raw material and energy costs, and legal proceedings.  A more extensive list and description of these factors can be found under the heading "Forward-Looking Statements" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, which appears in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company's other publicly-available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased in the open market $122.5 million face amount of its 8.75% senior notes due July 2008 and $50.0 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009.  Such repurchases were at a premium to the face amount.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against it and its affiliates in connection with the 1998 transaction in which the Cryovac packaging business of W. R. Grace was combined with Sealed Air.  The parties signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle.  The charges for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 were for legal and related fees.  For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2002, these charges reflected accruals for the cash and stock settlement expenses, as well as legal and related fees.

See the Supplementary Information included with this release for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share.
(3)
         
 
On July 18, 2003, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $51.00 per share and paid dividends accrued thereon from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $2.40 million.  The $51.00 per share redemption price included a $1.00 per share premium amounting to $25.45 million in the aggregate.
(1)
         
 
The basic earnings (loss) per common share calculations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include $0.01 and, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2002 includes $0.01 and $0.12, respectively, per share gains attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock.  There was no such gain recognized for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, since all shares of outstanding preferred stock were redeemed during the third quarter of 2003 (see Note 1).
(2)
         
 
In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the weighted average number of common shares for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 assumes the issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the asbestos settlement and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases.  For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2002, the weighted average number of common shares assumes the effect of the weighted average conversion of repurchased shares of preferred stock.
(3)
         
 
For the purpose of calculating diluted (loss) per common share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2002, net (loss) ascribed to common shareholders have been adjusted to exclude the gains attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock and to add back dividends attributable to such repurchased preferred stock, and the weighted average common shares outstanding have been adjusted to assume conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during such periods in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-53 guidance.
