SEALED AIR REPORTS 23% INCREASE IN FIRST QUARTER DILUTED EPS
 
SADDLE BROOK, N.J., Wednesday, April 28, 2004  Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.64 for the first quarter of 2004, a 23% increase over prior year earnings of $0.52.  Sealed Air's sales for the quarter increased 11% to $913.1 million, compared with $822.9 million in 2003.
 
Commenting on the Company's operating performance, William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:
 
  Our food packaging segment achieved modest unit volume gains despite import restrictions on U.S. beef products imposed by various countries.  Sealed Air's long-standing commitment to provide value to our customers around the world contributed to our results.  We also were particularly pleased with the Company's ability to generate cash.  During the quarter we repurchased approximately $25 million of Sealed Air common stock.  Even after these repurchases, we increased our cash balances by approximately $48 million.  Our earnings per share continued to realize the benefits of last year's recapitalization and debt repurchase."
"Sealed Air's performance in the quarter reflected solid unit volume growth in our protective packaging segment and strength in our international businesses.
 
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Mr. Hickey stated:
 
"Sealed Air is well positioned for growth in the recovering global economy with operations in 50 countries.  During the first quarter we started up our new manufacturing facility in Rogers, Arkansas.  We also expect another plant in the U.S. and one in Eastern Europe to come on stream later this year.  All of us at Sealed Air remain dedicated to our operating principles including focusing on cash flow and maintaining a tight control on expenses.  We expect that our operating expenses will fall within our goal of 16-17% of sales for the year and we expect to continue using our cash to invest in our business and deliver value to our shareholders."
 
Company and Segment Sales for the First Quarter
 
Net sales increased 11% to $913.1 million compared with $822.9 million for the first quarter of 2003.  The increase in net sales was primarily due to the $62.4 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, higher unit volumes and some favorable

changes in product price/mix.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 3%.  Sales outside the U.S. totaled $470.2 million, a 20% increase versus last year's comparable quarter.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, international sales would have increased 4%.
 
Net sales of the food packaging segment increased 11% to $562.9 million compared with $507.0 million in 2003.  The increase in net sales was due primarily to the $43.5 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in product price/mix and a small increase in unit volume.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales for this segment would have increased 2%.
 - 
                 
 
Net sales of the protective packaging segment increased 11% to $350.2 million compared with $315.9 million in 2003.  The increase in net sales was due primarily to the $18.9 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation and to volume growth of $15.4 million, while holding steady on overall product price/mix.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales for this segment would have increased 5%.

Financial Highlights for the First Quarter
 
Gross profit was $286.1 million, or 31.3% of net sales, compared with $259.5 million, or 31.5% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2003.
 - 
                 
 
Marketing, administrative and development expenses increased to $159.3 million compared with $138.7 million for the first quarter of 2003.  The increase in these expenses was due to a number of factors including the effects of foreign currency translation and R&D-related projects.  In addition, the Company is in the process of upgrading its information technology platform to improve our service to customers and improve our cost structure.  As a percentage of net sales, these expenses increased to 17.4% for the quarter, compared with 16.9% in 2003.
 - 
                 
 
Operating profit was $126.8 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared with $120.8 million, or 14.7% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2003.
 - 
                 
 
Interest expense increased to $38.1 million compared with $22.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 primarily due to interest expense from the Company's issuance of approximately $1.3 billion of senior notes and convertible senior notes in July 2003 and $300.0 million of senior notes in April 2003.  The Company used the proceeds from the July 2003 issuance to redeem its Series A convertible preferred stock.
 - 
                 
 
Other income was $5.3 million compared with expense of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2003.  The increase was primarily due to increased interest income and a reduced foreign exchange loss compared with the prior year quarter.
 - 
                 
 
The Company's effective tax rate was approximately 36.0% compared with 37.0% in the first quarter of 2003.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to improved tax efficiencies resulting from a recent reorganization of the Company's international subsidiaries.
 - 
                 
 
Outlook
 
The Company reaffirms its full year diluted earnings per common share guidance of $2.80 to $2.90, which was first communicated in our fourth quarter 2003 earnings release.  This guidance assumes a continued recovery in the global economy, stable petrochemical-related costs through the remainder of the year, and no adverse developments in our customers' businesses or market conditions.
