Item 2.05          Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
On October 27, 2004, Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company") announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the Company's long-term growth programs and financial goals and to improve the Company's operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure.  These plans will principally reduce the number of employees and consolidate or relocate operations in both of the Company's reportable business segments.  The Company expects to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges ranging from approximately $10 million to $15 million during the fourth quarter of 2004, of which approximately $9 million to $14 million will be charges for employee termination costs and approximately $1 million will be other charges.  The Company will also incur approximately $1 million to $2 million after 2004 to relocate assets from one site to another.  The Company anticipates that it will make cash expenditures totaling approximately $10 million to $16 million starting in the fourth quarter of 2004 through the second quarter of 2006.
