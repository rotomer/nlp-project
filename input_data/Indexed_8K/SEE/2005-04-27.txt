SEALED AIR REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2005 RESULTS
 
SADDLE BROOK, N.J., Wednesday, April 27, 2005  Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.58 for the first quarter of 2005, which includes restructuring charges of $0.01 per share.  Diluted earnings per common share were $0.62 in the first quarter of 2004.  Sealed Air's net sales for the quarter increased 6% to $969.8 million, compared with $913.1 million in 2004.
 
Commenting on the Company's operating performance, William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:
 
"Our first quarter was challenging due to record high costs for certain petrochemical-based raw materials and slow growth in our European businesses.  Recent sales price increases and continued productivity improvements offset much of the cumulative impact of a difficult raw material cost environment.  We achieved balanced sales growth in both our food packaging and protective packaging segments during the quarter.  We also maintained tight control of operating expenses and realized the benefits of reduced interest expense resulting from the retirement of approximately $200 million in debt during the fourth quarter of 2004."
 
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Mr. Hickey stated:
 
"Given the current level of uncertainty over the future direction of raw material costs, a longer than expected delay in the improvement of U.S. beef market conditions and concern regarding the continued strength of the global economy, we are now expecting to grow our diluted earnings per common share by approximately 5% in 2005 compared with adjusted earnings of $2.70 in 2004 ($2.25 in accordance with U.S. GAAP).  As such, we now expect our 2005 diluted earnings per common share to range from $2.80 to $2.90, compared with our previously guided range of $2.95 to $3.05.  While we are being cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year with respect to raw material costs and the U.S. beef market, we expect to see improved operating performance in the second half of the year as we begin to realize savings from our profit improvement initiatives introduced during the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, we expect our previously announced price increases to further mitigate the higher raw material costs during the rest of the year.  We also expect to start realizing measurable benefits from our supply chain enhancement efforts.  We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of our business as we continue to develop innovative packaging solutions that deliver incremental value to our customers around the world."
Financial Highlights for the First Quarter
 
Net sales increased 6% to $969.8 million compared with $913.1 million for the first quarter of 2004.  The increase in net sales resulted primarily from a $24 million favorable change in product price/mix combined with a $24 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 4%.
 - 
                 
 
Gross profit was $277.5 million, or 28.6% of net sales, compared with $286.1 million, or 31.3% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2004.  The decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to petrochemical-related raw material cost increases that were offset in part by selling price increases.
 - 
                 
 
Marketing, administrative and development expenses remained essentially flat at $159.3 million compared with $158.7 million for the first quarter of 2004, reflecting the Company's control of expenses.  As a percentage of net sales, these expenses declined to 16.4% for the quarter compared with 17.4% in 2004.
 - 
                 
 
The Company incurred restructuring charges of $1.0 million for additional costs relating to its global profit improvement initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The Company had recorded a charge of $33 million in the fourth quarter for the cost of these projects to improve the Company's operating efficiencies and cost structure.
 - 
                 
 
Operating profit was $117.2 million, or 12.1% of net sales, compared with $127.4 million, or 14.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2004.  The reduction in operating profit as a percentage of net sales reflects the reduction in gross profit.
 - 
                 
 
Interest expense declined to $36.8 million compared with $38.7 million in the first quarter of 2004 primarily resulting from the redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $177.5 million, of the Company's 8.75% senior notes due July 2008 and the repurchase of $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009, both completed in the fourth quarter of 2004, partially offset by a reduction in the favorable impact of interest rate swaps.
 - 
                 
 
The Company's effective income tax rate was 33.3% compared with 36.0% in the first quarter of 2004.  This decrease is primarily due to improved tax efficiencies resulting from reorganization of certain of the Company's international subsidiaries in 2004.
 - 
                 
 
The Company's capital expenditures were $20.6 million compared with $27.4 million in the first quarter of 2004.  The Company now expects that capital expenditures in 2005 will range from $100 to $125 million compared with its previous guidance of $125 to $150 million.

Business Segment Review
 
Food Packaging Segment
 
The Company's food packaging segment net sales for the first quarter increased 6% to $594.9 million compared with $562.9 million last year.  The key growth programs of Case Ready and Vertical Pouch Packaging exhibited double-digit growth during the quarter.  The food
packaging segment also experienced continued strength in Asia Pacific and Latin America, while Europe remained flat.  Excluding the $16 million positive effect of foreign currency translation, segment net sales would have increased 3%.  Operating profit for the first quarter was $75.9 million, or 12.8% of net sales, compared with $75.6 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in 2004.  The decline in operating profit as a percentage of sales was due to significant increases in raw material costs offset partially by increases in selling prices.
 
Protective Packaging Segment
 
The Company's protective packaging segment net sales for the first quarter increased 7% to $374.9 million compared with $350.2 million last year.  A positive change in product price/mix of 3% helped drive top-line growth.  Volumes were mixed, with an increase in North America offset by a decline in Europe.  Excluding the $8 million positive effect of foreign currency translation, segment net sales would have increased 5%.  Operating profit for the first quarter decreased to $42.5 million, or 11.3% of net sales, compared with $52.0 million, or 14.8% of net sales, in 2004.  The decline in operating profit was due to significant increases in raw material costs that were partially offset by selling price increases.

Non-GAAP Information
 
The Company's management from time to time presents information that is not in conformance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Diluted earnings per common share adjusted for special charges and changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation are among the indicators used by the Company's management to measure the performance of the Company's operations, and thus the Company's management believes such information may be useful to investors.  For a reconciliation of adjusted diluted
earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2004, see the supplementary information provided in this release.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
Some of the statements made by the Company in this press release are forward-looking.  These statements include comments as to future events and trends affecting the Company's business, which are based upon management's current expectations and are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "will" and similar expressions.  Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to a number of factors, such as changes in raw material and energy costs, the effects of animal and food-related health issues, import restrictions, factors affecting customers, economic, political, business and market conditions, tax, interest and exchange rates, the success of new products, restructuring charges, the application of new accounting pronouncements, and legal proceedings.  A more extensive list and description of these factors can be found under the heading "Forward-Looking Statements" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, which appears in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company's other publicly-available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
(1) For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, the amortization of certain capitalized senior debt issuance costs was included in interest expense. For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, this amortization expense was included in administrative expenses. The results for the 2004 period have been adjusted to conform to the 2005 presentation.
 
(2) In the first quarter of 2005, the Company incurred restructuring charges for additional costs relating to its global profit improvement initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company had recorded a charge of $33 million in the fourth quarter for the cost of these projects to improve the Company's operating efficiencies and cost structure.
 
(3) See the Supplementary Information included in this release for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share.
 
 
(1) The Company has retroactively applied the Emerging Issues Task Force, known as the EITF, Issue No. 04-08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share," which requires that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt, such as the Company's 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033, be included in dilutive earnings per common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to convert the debt into shares has been satisfied.
 
(2) In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the weighted average number of common shares for the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 provides for the conversion of the Company's 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033 upon application of EITF Issue No. 04-08, the assumed issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the Company's previously announced asbestos settlement, which is discussed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases.
 
(1) The Company's management believes that presenting diluted earnings per common share excluding the effects of the items listed above reflects the Company's operating performance on a basis consistent with the Company's most recent earnings guidance. The diluted earnings per common share for the full year excluding the items highlighted above is among the criteria upon which performance-based compensation may be based.
