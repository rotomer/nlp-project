SEALED AIR REPORTS RECORD SALES IN FOURTH QUARTER
 
Annual Sales Surpass $4 Billion Milestone
 
SADDLE BROOK, N.J., Monday, January 30, 2006  Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.77 for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with prior year diluted earnings per common share of $0.33.  The prior year quarter included charges related to restructuring and debt redemption and repurchases totaling $0.45 per common share.  Sealed Air's net sales for the quarter increased 6% to $1.1 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in 2004.
 
Full year 2005 diluted earnings per common share were $2.69, which includes $0.01 per share in additional charges related to the Company's fourth quarter 2004 restructuring program.  Diluted earnings per common share for the full year 2004 were $2.25, which included the charges totaling $0.45 per common share described above.  Sealed Air's net sales for the year increased 8% to $4.1 billion, compared with $3.8 billion in 2004.
 
Commenting on the Company's operating performance, William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:
 
"We are pleased to announce that Sealed Air achieved record sales in the fourth quarter and full year as our sales surpassed the $4 billion milestone.  Our solid sales growth throughout the first three quarters of the year continued in the fourth quarter with strength in both our food packaging segment and our protective packaging segment.  As expected, the fourth quarter was challenging from a raw material cost perspective.  However, we continued to mitigate the impact of raw material costs by maintaining tight control on operating expenses and by implementing additional price increases where appropriate.  Despite this difficult cost environment, our cash flow has remained strong.  We repurchased $41 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year repurchases to $116 million."
 
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Mr. Hickey stated:
 
"We are very pleased to announce that we are initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share. This decision reflects our commitment to our shareholders, the consistency of our cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, with our cash and short-term investment balances totaling $500 million at the end of this year.  Going forward, we expect
utilize our strong cash flow to continue to invest in our business, to reduce debt and to return value to our shareholders.
to
 
"We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of our business as we develop innovative packaging solutions for our customers and expand our global footprint.  We also will begin the first phase of a new global manufacturing strategy to make the right product in the right place at the right cost.  This strategy will include an expansion of our global production capabilities in developing markets around the world, as well as a realignment of our existing production into manufacturing centers of excellence.  The goal of this multi-year program is to further improve our operating efficiencies, lower our overall cost structure and implement new technologies more effectively.  This program, combined with our supply chain initiative, is expected to produce meaningful savings for the Company in future years.  By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, we will continue to enhance profitable growth and our global leadership position."
 
Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter
 
Net sales increased 6% to $1.1 billion compared with $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2004.  The increase in net sales principally resulted from the combined impact of a $39 million favorable change in product price/mix and $31 million in unit volume growth, partially offset by an $11 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 7%.
 - 
                 
 
Gross profit was $297 million, or 27.6% of net sales, compared with $308 million, or 30.3% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2004.  The decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to significantly higher petrochemical-based raw material and other energy-related costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases.
 - 
                 
 
Marketing, administrative and development expenses were held essentially flat at $161 million compared with $160 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.  As a percentage of net sales, these expenses declined to 14.9% for the quarter compared with 15.7% in 2004, reflecting the Company's tight control on expenses and a reduction in management incentive compensation since the Company did not meet earnings growth objectives for the year.
 - 
                 
 
Operating profit was $136 million, or 12.6% of net sales, compared with $115 million, or 11.3% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The prior year quarter included restructuring and other charges of $33 million.
 - 
                 
 
Interest expense declined to $37 million compared with $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The decrease was primarily due to the interest savings resulting from the redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $177.5 million, of the Company's 8.75% senior notes due July 2008, and the repurchase of $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009, both completed in the fourth quarter of 2004, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on the Company's outstanding interest rate swaps.
 - 
                 
Other income (expense), net, was income of $4.3 million in 2005 compared to expense of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  This change was primarily due to lower net foreign exchange transaction losses in 2005 compared with the fourth quarter of 2004.
 - 
                 
 
The Company's effective income tax rate was 28.9% compared with 26.3% in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The 28.9% rate in the quarter results from adjusting the Company's full year 33.3% rate to 32.1%, primarily due to the reversal of reserves for tax matters for periods that have closed in the relevant jurisdictions.

Business Segment Review
 
Food Packaging Segment
 
The Company's food packaging segment net sales for the fourth quarter increased 6% to $667 million compared with $630 million last year.  Sales for the quarter were driven by solid growth in Case Ready Packaging, record sales in Latin America and the positive effect of selling price increases.  Excluding the $6 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, segment net sales would have increased 7%.  Operating profit for the fourth quarter was $88 million, or 13.1% of net sales, compared with $94 million, or 14.8% of net sales, in 2004.  The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales was due to higher raw material and energy-related costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases.
 
Protective Packaging Segment
 
The Company's protective packaging segment net sales for the fourth quarter increased 6% to $409 million compared with $387 million last year.  Sales growth experienced during the quarter was balanced between volume growth and the positive impact of selling price increases.  Excluding the $5 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, segment net sales would have increased 7%.  Operating profit for the fourth quarter was $49 million, or 11.9% of net sales, compared with $55 million, or 14.2% of net sales, in 2004.  The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales was due to higher raw material and energy-related costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
The Company's capital expenditures in 2005 were $97 million compared with $103 million in 2004.  The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2006 will range between $125 and $150 million.  This estimate includes costs related to new facilities in China that will supply both food packaging and protective packaging products to meet the growing needs of the Chinese market.  The Company does not expect this range to change as it initiates projects related to its global manufacturing strategy.
 
Cash Dividend
 
The Company announced today that it is initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend.  The Company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per common share, which is payable on March 17, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2006.
Earnings Guidance
 
Sealed Air expects its full year 2006 diluted earnings per common share to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.10.  This guidance assumes a gradual easing of petrochemical-based raw material costs throughout the year, a full year tax rate of 33.3% and steady growth in the global economy.  This guidance does not consider the potential impact of costs related to the implementation of the Company's global manufacturing strategy mentioned earlier.

Non-GAAP Information

Changes in net sales excluding the effect of foreign currency translation are among the indicators used by the Company's management to measure the performance of the Company's operations, and thus management believes that this information may be useful to investors.  Such measures are also among the criteria upon which performance-based compensation may be determined.
