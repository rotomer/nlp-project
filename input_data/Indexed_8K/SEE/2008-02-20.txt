CURRENT REPORT
Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
SEALED AIR CORPORATION
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
On February 19, 2008, the Organization and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company") approved a new Annual
Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to enhance the ability of the Company to motivate, attract, and retain the services of individuals upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful conduct of the Company's operation is largely dependent.  The Plan furthers these goals by providing eligible employees of the Company an opportunity to participate in the Company's success by earning annual incentive compensation in the form of a cash bonus (or in certain cases, as noted below, a stock award) based on the achievement by the Company of certain pre-established goals and the employees' contributions towards meeting the goals.  The Plan includes the creation and allocation of a Company-wide annual bonus pool.
The Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other "named executive officers" for whom disclosure was required pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, in the Company's proxy statement for the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders, are eligible to participate in the Plan, together with other Company officers as well as key employees selected for participation by the Committee.
The Plan contains a provision pursuant to which Company officers and senior executives selected by the Committee will be given a leveraged opportunity to receive restricted stock or restricted stock units granted under the Company's 2005 Contingent Stock Plan in lieu of cash as all or part of their annual bonus award. This stock leverage opportunity component of the Plan is subject to stockholder approval of amendments to the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan at the 2008 annual meeting.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements
Some of the statements made by the Company in, or incorporated by reference in, this Current Report on Form 8-K are forward-looking.  These statements include comments as to future events and trends affecting the Company's business, which are based upon management's current expectations and are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "will" and similar expressions.  The following are important factors that the Company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the Company's forward-looking statements: the success of the Company's growth, profitability and global manufacturing strategies; changes in raw material and energy costs; the effects of animal and food-related health issues; market conditions; tax, interest and exchange rates; and legal proceedings.  A more extensive list and description of these and other such factors can be found under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," which appear in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.

The grant date for such restricted stock will be established by the Committee and will be no earlier than the date the Committee determines the annual bonus award for an executive officer and no later than March 15 of the year in which the annual bonuses for the year are otherwise paid.  Such restricted stock or restricted stock units will vest 100% on the second anniversary of the grant date or earlier in the case of death, disability (as defined in the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan) or retirement from employment by the Company.    All other terms and conditions of the restricted stock or restricted stock unit award will be set forth in an Award Grant consistent with the requirements of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan.  "Retirement" for this purpose will mean termination of employment after five or more years of employment with the Company and with years of employment plus age equal to 70 or more.  Each eligible officer or other senior executive will be required to complete a stock leverage opportunity election form each year on which he or she will acknowledge that the annual bonus for the year is subject to the Company's Policy on Recoupment of Incentive Compensation.

(d)           This Plan may be modified or discontinued at any time with or without notice at the discretion of the Company.

Plan participation does not limit the Company from terminating the employment of an employee at any time, with or without cause or notice. 
 
 
Participation in the Plan during a year does not imply participation in any subsequent year.  This Plan shall be administered, interpreted and enforced so as to ensure its compliance with all applicable laws, and nothing herein is intended or should be construed to violate any such law.
