Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements
 
Some of the statements made by the Company in, or incorporated by reference in, this Current Report on Form 8-K are forward-looking.  These statements include comments as to future events and trends affecting the Company's business, which are based upon management's current expectations and are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "will" and similar expressions.  The following are important factors that the Company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the Company's forward-looking statements: the success of the Company's growth, profitability and global manufacturing strategies; changes in raw material and energy costs; the effects of animal and food-related health issues; market conditions; tax, interest and exchange rates; and legal proceedings.  A more extensive list and description of these and other such factors can be found under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," which appear in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Exhibit 10.1
 
The Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has approved the policy that the Company will, to the extent permitted by governing law, require reimbursement to the Company of all or a portion of any annual incentive compensation (whether payable in cash or by an award under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan) and any Performance Share Units awards under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan awarded to any executive officer of the Company or to the leader of any business unit or function of the Company for performance periods beginning on or after January 1, 2008, where:
 
(a)
         
the payment or award was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a substantial restatement,
(b)
        
in the view of the Board, the officer or leader engaged in fraud or misconduct, or recklessly or negligently failed to prevent the fraud or misconduct, that caused or significantly contributed to the need for the substantial restatement, and
(c)
         
either no payment or award, or a lower payment or award, would have been made to the officer or leader based upon the restated results.
 
In each case, the Company will, to the extent practicable, seek to recover the amount by which the officer's or leader's annual incentive compensation and/or Performance Share Units award for the relevant period exceeded the lower amount that would have been paid or awarded (or the entire amount, if nothing would have been paid or awarded).  This may include the cancellation of all or a portion of unvested awards or unpaid awards (or a delay in payment of any such awards while financial results are under review by the Company).
 
In addition, any person who is subject to forfeiture of compensation or profits from the sale of the Company's securities under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall reimburse the Company the amount of such compensation and profits.
 
In addition to these reimbursements, the Company may take any other actions that it deems appropriate to remedy the fraud or misconduct based on a consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances.
