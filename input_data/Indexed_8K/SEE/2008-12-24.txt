At the annual meeting of the stockholders of Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company") held on May 20, 2008, the Company's stockholders approved the amended 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation (the "Contingent Stock Plan").  The Contingent Stock Plan provides for awards of equity-based compensation, including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and cash awards measured by share price, to executive officers and other key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as to U.S.-based key consultants to the Company.  As set forth in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2008 annual meeting, as part of the new annual incentive plan approved by the Organization and Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors on February 19, 2008, prior to the start of each performance year, each of the Company's executive officers and other key executives designated by the Compensation Committee are eligible to elect to receive all or a portion of their annual cash bonus for that year, in increments of 25% of the annual bonus, as an award of restricted stock or restricted stock units under the Contingent Stock Plan in lieu of cash. The portion provided as an equity award may be given a premium to be determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company refers to these awards as "Stock Leverage Opportunity" awards. For 2008 and 2009, the Compensation Committee has approved a 25% premium for the portion of the annual cash bonuses for those years, if any, that is provided as an equity award.
 
On November 18, 2008, the Compensation Committee approved the following forms of agreement:  (i) Form of Restricted Stock Agreement for awards pursuant to the Stock Leverage Opportunity provision of the Company's annual incentive plan (attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference); and (ii) Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement for awards pursuant to the Stock Leverage Opportunity provision of the Company's annual incentive plan (attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference).  These forms of agreement contain two-year periods of restriction.  During the periods of restriction, the restricted stock or restricted stock units granted under these agreements shall be forfeited on termination of employment with the Company, other than as a result of the employee's death, disability or retirement, with limited exceptions.  Until the end of the applicable periods of restriction the restricted stock or restricted stock units may not be sold, transferred, pledged or encumbered. The periods of restriction are subject to change in control provisions.

During 2008, the Compensation Committee has also approved the following amended forms of agreement:  (i) Form of Restricted Stock Agreement, as amended, under the Contingent Stock Plan (attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference); (ii) Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, as amended, under the Contingent Stock Plan (attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 and incorporated herein by reference); and (iii) Form of Cash Award Agreement, as amended, under the amended Contingent Stock Plan (attached hereto as Exhibit 10.5 and incorporated herein by reference).  These forms of agreement provide for awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards, respectively, under the Contingent Stock Plan. The cash awards are measured by the fair market value of shares of the Company's common stock. These forms of agreement contain three-year periods of restriction. 
 
The Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other "named executive officers" for whom disclosure was required pursuant to Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, in the Company's proxy statement for the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, are eligible to participate in the Contingent Stock Plan and the Stock Leverage Opportunity, together with other Company officers as well as key employees selected for participation by the Compensation Committee.

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT
 
AGREEMENT dated as of                between SEALED AIR CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and                (the "Employee").
 
The Employee is now in the employ of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and was selected by the Organization and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to be given a leveraged opportunity to receive an award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation pursuant to the Stock Leverage Opportunity (SLO) provision of the Corporation's Annual Incentive Plan for the 2008 calendar year.  This award of Restricted Stock is made based on the portion of the Employee's annual bonus award for 2008 elected by the Employee to be received as such under the SLO provision of the Annual Incentive Plan, the amount of the Employee's annual bonus award for 2008 as approved by the Committee, and the 25% premium applicable to such award that was approved by the Committee.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation and the Employee mutually agree as follows:
 
. 
Section 1
Grant of Restricted Stock
 
Subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the Corporation hereby grants to the Employee all rights, title and interest in the record and beneficial ownership of *        * shares (the "Restricted Stock") of Common Stock.  The Restricted Stock is granted under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation (as amended and in effect from time to time, the "Plan") and is subject to the provisions of the Plan, which is made a part of this Agreement, as well as to the provisions of this Agreement.  All
 
 
capitalized terms have the meanings set forth in the Plan unless otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement.
 
. 
Section 2
Period of Restriction and Forfeiture of Restricted Stock
 
The Period of Restriction applicable to the Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement begins on the date of this Agreement and ends on the second anniversary of that date, except that the Period of Restriction shall end earlier upon termination of employment following a Change in Control in the circumstances described in Section 7 (iii) of the Plan.  During the Period of Restriction, the Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement shall be forfeited to the Corporation on the Date of Termination of the Employee with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries other than as a result of the Employee's death, Disability or Retirement.  No later than 90 days following the Date of Termination, the Committee may determine not to seek forfeiture of all or part of the shares of Restricted Stock and to permit the shares of Restricted Stock to be paid immediately (in whole or in part) or to continue to vest during the remainder of the original Period of Restriction subject to satisfaction of conditions specified by the Committee.  Until the end of the Period of Restriction or the earlier occurrence of the Employee's death, Disability or Retirement, neither the shares of Restricted Stock nor any interest in such shares shall be sold, transferred, pledged or encumbered. "Retirement" for the purpose of this Agreement shall mean termination of Employee status after five or more years of employment with the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and as of the Retirement date the number of years of employment plus the age of the Employee equals 70 or more, that Retirement shall not include termination of employment by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause.
provided
 
. 
Section 3
Effect of Forfeiture
 
With respect to all shares of Restricted Stock that are forfeited, the Employee shall have no further rights as a stockholder from and after the date of forfeiture.  The Employee agrees that forfeited shares of Restricted Stock shall be deemed canceled and returned to the treasury of the Corporation and that the Employee will have no further incidents of ownership, including no right to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to forfeited shares.
 
 
Section 4.
Custody of Restricted Stock
 
Certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement shall be held by the Corporation until the end of the Period of Restriction or the earlier occurrence of the Employee's death, Disability or Retirement.  At the end of the Period of Restriction or at the earlier occurrence of the Employee's death,  Disability or Retirement, provided that the Restricted Stock has not been forfeited previously, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the Employee (or to the Employee's estate, in the event of the Employee's death) either a certificate or certificates or a statement in book entry form representing the shares of Restricted Stock to be paid under this Agreement and free of the restrictive legend and stop-transfer instructions described in Section 5.  Shares will be delivered as soon as administratively practicable after the Period of Restriction ends, generally within 30 days.
 
. 
Section 5
Legend on Stock Certificates
 
Every certificate of Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement shall, so long as the restrictions described in Section 2 remain in effect, bear a legend in substantially the following form:
 
This certificate and the shares represented hereby are held subject to the terms of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation which Plan provides that the
 
shares issued pursuant thereto are subject to forfeiture to Sealed Air Corporation during a Period of Restriction and that neither such shares nor any interest therein may be sold, transferred, pledged or encumbered until the end of the Period of Restriction.  If forfeiture occurs, the holder of the shares represented by this certificate will have no further rights with respect to such shares and this certificate will be deemed void.  A copy of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan is available for inspection at the executive offices of Sealed Air Corporation.
 
and shall have in effect a stop-transfer order with respect thereto.
 
. 
Section 6
Ownership Rights
 
Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and subject to Sections 9 and 10, during the Period of Restriction the Employee is entitled to all voting and ownership rights applicable to the Restricted Stock, including the right to receive any cash dividends that may be paid on the Restricted Stock.
 
. 
Section 7
Securities and Other Regulations
 
The Corporation shall not be required to deliver any shares of Common Stock, to remove restrictive legends or stop-transfer orders following the end of the Period of Restriction or to take any other action until the requirements of any federal, state or foreign securities law, rules or regulations or other applicable laws or rules (including the rules of any securities exchange) as may be determined by the Corporation to be applicable are satisfied.
 
. 
Section 8
Registration of Shares
 
The Corporation shall be under no obligation to register any shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued under this Agreement under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
. 
Section 9
No Rights in Common Stock
 
The Employee shall not have any interest in or be entitled to any voting rights or dividends or other rights or privileges of stockholders of the Corporation with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to the Employee and then only from the date the Employee becomes the record owner thereof.
 
. 
Section 10
Adjustments
 
In the event of changes in corporate capitalization, such as a stock dividend, split-up, combination of shares, or reclassification, or a corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, separation, including a spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of the Corporation, any reorganization, or any partial or complete liquidation of the Corporation after the date of this Agreement:  (a) appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Committee as to the number and class of shares that may be issued under the Plan and in the number and class of and/or price of shares subject to outstanding grants made under the Plan, including the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights, and (b) the restrictions described in Section 2 and the requirement of a legend on stock certificates as described in Section 5 shall apply to any securities issued in connection with any such change in respect of the Restricted Stock issued under this Agreement.
 
 
Section 11.
Action by Corporation
 
Neither the existence of this Agreement nor the issuance of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall impair the right of the Corporation or its stockholders to make or effect any of the adjustments, recapitalizations or other changes in the Common Stock referred to in Section 
 
10, any change in the Corporation's business, any issuance of debt obligations or stock by the Corporation or any grant of options with respect to stock of the Corporation.
 
. 
Section 12
Corporation's Right to Terminate Employment
 
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon the Employee a right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time, whether with or without cause.
 
 
Section 13.
Not a Contract of Employment; No Acquired Rights
 
Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of employment between the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and the Employee.  The grant of the right to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Plan does not create any obligation on the part of the Corporation or the Employee's employer to make additional grants in the future and shall not constitute an acquired labor right for purposes of any foreign law.  The Employee recognizes the absolute right of his or her employer and of the Corporation to amend or cancel the Plan at any time subject to the terms of the Plan without thereby incurring any liability to the Employee.
 
. 
Section 14
Effect on Compensation
 
The grant of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a part of the Employee's salary or compensation for purposes of determining the Employee's payments or benefits under any benefit plan, severance program or severance pay law of the Corporation, any Subsidiary or any country.  Neither the Plan nor the grant of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall afford the Employee any additional right to severance payments or other termination awards or compensation under any foreign law as a result of the termination of the Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever.
 
. 
Section 15
Tax-Related Items
 
Regardless of any action the Corporation or the Employee's employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding (Tax-Related Items), the Employee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items owed by the Employee is and remains the Employee's responsibility and that the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the grant of Restricted Stock, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock, the subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock issued following the end of the Period of Restriction and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate the Employee's liability for Tax-Related Items.  If the Corporation determines that it and/or the Employee's employer must withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of the Employee's participation in the Plan, the Employee agrees as a condition of the grant of the Restricted Stock to make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer to enable it to satisfy all withholding requirements, including, but not limited to, withholding any applicable Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the Restricted Stock.  In addition, the Employee authorizes the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer to fulfill its withholding obligations by all legal means, including, but not limited to: withholding Tax-Related Items from the Employee's wages, salary or other cash compensation the Employee's employer pays to the Employee; withholding Tax-Related Items from the cash proceeds, if any, received upon sale of any shares of Common Stock received following the end of the Period of Restriction in respect of the Restricted Stock, and at the time of payment, withholding shares of Common Stock sufficient to meet minimum withholding obligations for
 
Tax-Related Items.  The Corporation may refuse to issue and deliver shares of Common Stock in payment of any earned Restricted Stock if the Employee fails to comply with any withholding obligation.
 
. 
Section 16
Foreign Indemnity
 
The Employee agrees to indemnify the Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries for the Employee's portion of any social insurance obligations or taxes arising under any foreign law with respect to the grant of Restricted Stock under this Agreement, the end of the Period of Restriction, or the sale or other disposition of the Restricted Stock.
 
 
Section 17.
Injunctive Relief
 
In addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Corporation as a result of the breach of the Employee's obligations hereunder, the Corporation shall be entitled to enforcement of such obligations by an injunction or a decree of specific performance from a court with appropriate jurisdiction and, in the event that the Corporation is successful in any suit or proceeding brought or instituted by the Corporation to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or on account of any damages sustained by the Corporation by reason of the violation by the Employee of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement to be performed by the Employee, the Employee agrees to pay to the Corporation all costs and expenses including attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the Corporation.
 
. 
Section 18
Interpretation
 
The Employee agrees that all questions of interpretation and administration of this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive upon him or her.  If the Committee is not acting, its functions may be performed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, and each reference in
 
this Agreement to the Committee shall, in that event, be deemed to refer to the Board of Directors.
 
. 
Section 19
Severability
 
If any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be fully severable, but shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never been included.

Section 5.
Ownership Rights
 
During the Period of Restriction, the Employee shall not be entitled to voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units covered by this Agreement, nor to the right to receive cash dividends.  The Committee has agreed that, on or about the date that shares of Common Stock are issued to the Employee under Section 4 above, the Corporation shall make a payment of dividend equivalents to the Employee in cash equal to the aggregate amount of cash dividends (without interest) that would have been paid to the Employee prior to the date of issuance if such shares had been issued to the Employee on the date of this Agreement, that the amount of the dividend equivalents payment will be adjusted appropriately if any of the transactions noted in Section 9 have occurred prior to issuance of the shares.

The Employee is now in the employ of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and has been selected by the Organization and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Corporation as an employee who is in a position to make a significant contribution to the growth and success of the Corporation.  Pursuant to the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation, the Corporation desires to provide an incentive to the Employee that will permit him or her to share directly in the growth of the Corporation and to further identify his or her interests with those of the stockholders of the Corporation.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation and the Employee mutually agree as follows:
 
. 
Section 1
Grant of Restricted Stock
 
Subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the Corporation hereby grants to the Employee all rights, title and interest in the record and beneficial ownership of ** shares (the "Restricted Stock") of the $0.10 par value Common Stock of the Corporation ("Common Stock").  The Restricted Stock is granted under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation (as amended and in effect from time to time, the "Plan") and is subject to the provisions of the Plan, which is made a part of this Agreement, as well as to the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 2
Period of Restriction and Forfeiture of Restricted Stock
 
                The Period of Restriction applicable to the Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement begins on the date of this Agreement and ends on the third anniversary of that date, except that the Period of Restriction shall end earlier upon termination of employment following a Change

During the Period of Restriction, the Restricted Stock granted under this Agreement shall be forfeited to the Corporation on the Date of Termination of the Employee with the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries other than as a result of the Employee's death or Disability.  No later than 90 days following the Date of Termination, the Committee may determine not to seek forfeiture of all or part of the shares of Restricted Stock and to permit the shares of Restricted Stock to be paid immediately (in whole or in part) or to continue to vest during the remainder of the original Period of Restriction subject to satisfaction of conditions specified by the Committee.  Until the end of the Period of Restriction or the earlier occurrence of the Employee's death or Disability, neither the shares of Restricted Stock nor any interest in such shares shall be sold, transferred, pledged or encumbered.

If forfeiture occurs, the holder of the shares represented by this certificate will have no further rights with respect to such shares and this certificate will be deemed void.

                The Employee shall not have any interest in or be entitled to any voting rights or dividends or other rights or privileges of stockholders of the Corporation with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares of Common Stock are actually issued to the Employee and then only from the date the Employee becomes the record owner thereof.
 
. 
Section 10
Adjustments
 
                In the event of changes in corporate capitalization, such as a stock dividend, split-up, combination of shares, or reclassification, or a corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, separation, including a spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of the Corporation, any reorganization, or any partial or complete liquidation of the Corporation after the date of this Agreement:  (a) appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Committee as to the number and class of shares that may be issued under the Plan and in the number and class of and/or price of shares subject to outstanding grants made under the Plan, including the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement, as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights, and (b) the

. 
Section 12
Corporation's Right to Terminate Employment
 
                Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon the Employee a right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time, whether with or without cause.
 
 
Section 13.
Not a Contract of Employment; No Acquired Rights
 
Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of employment between the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and the Employee.  The grant of the right to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Plan does not create any obligation on the part of the Corporation or the Employee's employer to make additional grants in the future and shall not constitute an acquired labor right for purposes of any foreign law.  The Employee recognizes the absolute right of his or her employer and of the Corporation to amend or cancel the Plan at any time subject to the terms of the Plan without thereby incurring any liability to the Employee.
               
. 
Section 14
Effect on Compensation
 
                The grant of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a part of the Employee's salary or compensation for purposes of determining the Employee's payments or benefits under any benefit plan, severance program or severance pay law of the Corporation, any Subsidiary or any country.  Neither the Plan nor the grant of Restricted Stock under this Agreement shall afford the Employee any additional right to severance payments or other termination awards or compensation under any foreign law as a result of the termination of the Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever.
 
. 
Section 15
Tax-Related Items
 
Regardless of any action the Corporation or the Employee's employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding (Tax-Related Items), the Employee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items owed by the Employee is and remains the Employee's responsibility and that the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the grant of Restricted Stock, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock, the subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock issued following the end of the Period of Restriction and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate the Employee's liability for Tax-Related Items.  If the Corporation determines that it and/or the Employee's employer must withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of the Employee's participation in the Plan, the Employee agrees as a condition of the grant of the Restricted Stock to make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer to enable it to satisfy all withholding requirements, including, but not limited to, withholding any applicable Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the Restricted Stock.  In addition, the Employee authorizes the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer to
 
fulfill its withholding obligations by all legal means, including, but not limited to: withholding Tax-Related Items from the Employee's wages, salary or other cash compensation the Employee's employer pays to the Employee; withholding Tax-Related Items from the cash proceeds, if any, received upon sale of any shares of Common Stock received following the end of the Period of Restriction in respect of the Restricted Stock, and at the time of payment, withholding shares of Common Stock sufficient to meet minimum withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items.  The Corporation may refuse to issue and deliver shares of Common Stock in payment of any earned Restricted Stock if the Employee fails to comply with any withholding obligation.
 
. 
Section 16
Foreign Indemnity
 
                The Employee agrees to indemnify the Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries for the Employee's portion of any social insurance obligations or taxes arising under any foreign law with respect to the grant of Restricted Stock under this Agreement, the end of the Period of Restriction, or the sale or other disposition of the Restricted Stock.
 
 
Section 17.
Injunctive Relief
 
In addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Corporation as a result of the breach of the Employee's obligations hereunder, the Corporation shall be entitled to enforcement of such obligations by an injunction or a decree of specific performance from a court with appropriate jurisdiction and, in the event that the Corporation is successful in any suit or proceeding brought or instituted by the Corporation to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or on account of any damages sustained by the Corporation by reason of the violation by the Employee of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement to be performed by the Employee, the Employee agrees to pay to the Corporation all costs and expenses including attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the Corporation.
. 
Section 18
Interpretation
 
                The Employee agrees that all questions of interpretation and administration of this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive upon him or her.  If the Committee is not acting, its functions may be performed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, and each reference in this Agreement to the Committee shall, in that event, be deemed to refer to the Board of Directors.
 
. 
Section 19
Severability
 
If any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be fully severable, but shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never been included.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon the Employee a right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time, whether with or without cause.
 
Section 7.
 
Not a Contract of Employment; No Acquired Rights
 
Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of employment between the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and the Employee.  The Cash Award and the right to be paid cash upon vesting does not create any obligation on the part of the Corporation or the Employee's employer to make additional awards in the future and shall not constitute an acquired labor right for purposes of any foreign law.  The Employee recognizes the absolute right of his or her employer and of the Corporation to amend or cancel the Plan at any time subject to the terms of the Plan without thereby incurring any liability to the Employee.
 
Section 8.
 
Effect on Compensation
 
The grant of a Cash Award under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a part of the
Employee's salary or compensation for purposes of determining the Employee's payments or benefits under any benefit plan, severance program or severance pay law of the Corporation, any Subsidiary or any country.  Neither the Plan nor the Cash Award shall afford the Employee any additional right to severance payments or other termination awards or compensation under any foreign law as a result of the termination of the Employee's employment for any reason whatsoever.
 
Section 9
. 
Tax-Related Items
 
Regardless of any action the Corporation or the Employee's employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding (Tax-Related Items), the Employee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items owed by the Employee is and remains the Employee's responsibility and that the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the grant or vesting of this Cash Award; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Cash Award to reduce or eliminate the Employee's liability for Tax-Related Items.  If the Corporation determines that it and/or the Employee's employer must withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of the Employee's participation in the Plan, the Employee agrees as a condition of the grant of the Cash Award to make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer to enable it to satisfy all withholding requirements, including, but not limited to, withholding any applicable Tax-Related Items from the pay-out of the Cash Award.  In addition, the Employee authorizes the Corporation and/or the Employee's employer to fulfill its withholding obligations by all legal means, including, but not limited to withholding Tax-Related Items from the Employee's wages, salary or other cash compensation the Employee's employer pays to the Employee.
Section 10.
 
Foreign Indemnity
 
The Employee agrees to indemnify the Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries for the Employee's portion of any social insurance obligations or taxes arising under any foreign law with respect to the Cash Award.
 
Section 11
. 
Injunctive Relief
 
In addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Corporation as a result of the breach of the Employee's obligations hereunder, the Corporation shall be entitled to enforcement of such obligations by an injunction or a decree of specific performance from a court with appropriate jurisdiction and, in the event that the Corporation is successful in any suit or proceeding brought or instituted by the Corporation to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or on account of any damages sustained by the Corporation by reason of the violation by the Employee of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement to be performed by the Employee, the Employee agrees to pay to the Corporation all costs and expenses including attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the Corporation.
 
Section 12
. 
Interpretation
 
The Employee agrees that all questions of interpretation and administration of this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive upon him or her.  If the Committee is not acting, its functions may be performed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, and each reference in this Agreement to the Committee shall, in that event, be deemed to refer to the Board of Directors.
Section 13.
 
Severability
 
If any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be fully severable, but shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never been included.
