Explanatory Note
          Sealed Air Corporation ("we" or "our") is filing this amendment to its Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 24, 2011, to refurnish the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 in order to correct typographical errors in the last sentence of the section entitled "Protective Packaging Segment" on page 2 of the press release.
          As amended, this sentence has been corrected to read "Adjusting for the costs of the closure, operating profit would have been $41 million, or 12.0% of net sales", and not the originally reported "Adjusting for the costs of the closure, operating profit would have been $45 million, or 13.0% of net sales." All other information included in the original filing is unchanged.
          On January 24, 2011, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. We have attached the press release as Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
          The information included in this item, including Exhibit 99.1, is hereby furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
     (d) Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
     ELMWOOD PARK, N.J., Monday, January 24, 2011  For full year 2010, Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) reported diluted net earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.44, compared with $1.35 in 2009. Adjusted EPS was $1.60 in 2010, compared with $1.44 in 2009. (See attached supplements for non-GAAP reconciliations and information.) Sales increased 6% to $4.49 billion. Gross profit increased 3% to $1.25 billion while operating profit increased 9% to $535 million. The 2010 adjusted operating profit was $549 million, or 12.2% of net sales. This compares with $509 million, or 12.0%, in 2009.
     Fourth quarter 2010 EPS was $0.29, compared with $0.37 in 2009, primarily due to the loss on debt redemption of our 12% Senior Notes. Adjusted EPS increased 15% to $0.46, compared with $0.40 in 2009. Sales increased 6% to $1.21 billion. Fourth quarter gross profit held relatively steady at $332 million, while operating profit increased 9% to $135 million. The 2010 adjusted operating profit was $145 million, or 12.0% of net sales. This compares with $132 million, or 11.5%, in 2009.
     Commenting on our operating performance, William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:
     "As we conclude Sealed Air's 50 anniversary year and look ahead to 2011, I am pleased with the good volume momentum that our businesses achieved in all regions this year, resulting in solid fourth quarter volume performance. During the year, we remained focused on growth by successfully launching over 55 new solutions, including expanding our service-based offerings, and by completing four early-stage strategic investments.
th
     In 2010, we achieved approximately $100 million of productivity benefits by leveraging our World Class Manufacturing principles, implementing new, patented technologies, and successfully completing our Global Manufacturing Strategy program. These productivity gains, as well as tight control of expenses and pricing actions, contributed to our steady profitability performance despite the timing of price/cost spreads.
1
 
     All of these achievements contributed to solid free cash flow, which enabled us to invest in our extensive product pipeline, expand our geographic footprint and return $90 million to shareholders in dividend payments and share buybacks. Today, we remain well positioned to fund near term obligations and continue to invest in our future."
Fourth Quarter Segment Review
     The following year-over-year net sales discussions exclude the impact of currency translation, which we define as "constant dollar," a non-U.S. GAAP measure. The balance of the discussion is presented on a U.S. GAAP basis. See "Components of Change in Net Sales  Business Segments and Other," attached, for further details.
     In the following segment discussions, the 2010 fourth quarter operating profit results for each segment include lower incentive compensation expenses, as we did not fully achieve our 2010 performance goals.
Food Packaging Segment
     Sales increased 6% on a constant dollar basis, with 6% higher volumes as all regions grew, reflecting seasonality in the holiday period and increased demand for our solutions. Volume growth was primarily driven by a 7% increase in North America and a 9% increase in Europe. Despite the benefits of price increases and formula contract adjustments in the quarter, price/mix was negatively affected by the volatility of the foreign currency environment in Venezuela and selectively lower pricing associated with higher customer volume commitments. Adjusting for the foreign currency effect, price/mix would have been positive for the quarter. Operating profit increased 17% to $78 million, or 14.7% of net sales, compared with 13.3% in 2009.
Food Solutions Segment
     Sales increased 6% on a constant dollar basis, with 6% higher volumes, which were primarily driven by an 11% increase in Europe. Price/mix was relatively steady as the mix effect in volume growth from some lower priced products offset benefits from our prior pricing actions. Operating profit increased 43% to $28 million, or 11.2% of net sales, compared with 8.2% in 2009. The increase in operating profit is primarily due to leveraging higher volumes and tight control of expenses.
Protective Packaging Segment
     Sales increased 7% on a constant dollar basis, with 8% higher volumes reflecting improving industrial production rates in North America and Europe and strength in fulfillment/e-commerce applications. Price/mix was 1% lower due to selective pricing actions, the introduction of new thinner profile products and the timing of our December 1 price increase. Operating profit decreased 9% to $38 million, or 11.0% of net sales, compared with 12.9% in 2009. The decline in operating profit primarily reflects charges associated with the December announcement of the closure of a small factory in Europe. Adjusting for the costs of the closure, operating profit would have been $41 million, or 12.0% of net sales.
st
Other Category
     Sales increased 6% on a constant dollar basis, with 8% higher volumes reflecting growth in both Specialty Materials and Medical Applications. Price/mix was 2% lower primarily due to volume rebates in our Medical Applications business. We recognized an operating loss of $2
2
 
million, primarily from our new ventures investments. This compares with a 1.7% operating profit margin in 2009.
Fourth Quarter Other Matters
     In December, we completed an early redemption of $150 million of the outstanding $300 million principal amount of our 12% Senior Notes due February 14, 2014. The aggregate redemption price was approximately $196 million, including approximately $5 million of accrued interest, and was funded with available cash. As a result, we recorded a charge to net earnings of approximately $24 million, or $0.14 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2010, which includes a gain resulting from the termination of a related interest rate swap. The annual interest expense savings from this redemption are $18 million, or $0.06 per common share, beginning in December 2010 through February 2014.
     In our Global Manufacturing Strategy, or GMS program, we recognized an additional $4 million of charges in the fourth quarter. This includes $3 million in restructuring resulting from additional headcount reductions identified during the completion of the program. The additional $1 million of charges in cost of sales relates to our previously announced plan to cease certain operations at one of our German locations. This compares to $8 million of charges, primarily in restructuring, in 2009. These charges mark the completion of projects related to GMS. We realized a $55 million annual benefit run rate from this program in 2010 and expect these benefits to continue in 2011.
     The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 13.3% compared to 25.3% in the prior year period. On a full year basis, the 2010 effective tax rate was 25.5% compared to 25.9% in 2009. Our most recent 2010 guidance of 28% was noted to be without the benefit of certain U.S. tax credits, which had previously expired. Those tax credits were retroactively extended in December and our favorable rates reflect that retroactive extension. Additionally, our rate was further reduced by a higher mix of foreign earnings due to the net loss associated with the premium we paid to redeem the 12% Senior Notes discussed above.
2011 Outlook and Earnings Guidance
Commenting on our outlook, Mr. Hickey stated:
     "Through the strengths of our extensive global footprint, customers' solid reception of our new products and services, a strong new product pipeline that leverages differentiated, patented technologies, and a leaner cost structure, we are well positioned to capture the many opportunities ahead of us. As our revenue grows we expect ongoing margin expansion, which will bring us a step closer to our goal of a 15% operating margin."
     In 2011, we are anticipating an ongoing modest rate of economic recovery and an average constant dollar sales growth rate in the 5% to 7% range. Presently, our full year 2011 guidance also assumes:
3
 
     As a result, we anticipate full year 2011 EPS to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90.
     In addition, capital expenditures in 2011 are estimated to be $150 to $175 million and free cash flow is expected to once again exceed $300 million.
     Our guidance excludes the payment of the W. R. Grace settlement, as the exact timing of the settlement is unknown, although it is possible that a confirmation order and final payment could occur sometime in the first half of 2011. Final payment of the W. R. Grace settlement is expected to be accretive to EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.14 annually following the payment date under the assumption of using a substantial portion of cash on hand for the payment and ceasing to accrue interest on the settlement amount. Additionally, our guidance excludes any non-operating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2011 due to currency fluctuations in Venezuela.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:
 
Restructuring and other charges of $4.4 million in 2010 relate to our global manufacturing strategy in our Food Packaging segment and restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2010 relate to a packaging facility closure in Europe, which is included in our Protective Packaging segment. In 2010, we also recorded restructuring credits of $0.9 million, which related to our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program. Restructuring and other charges in 2009 primarily related to the relocation of our bag making and printing operations in Germany, as part of our global manufacturing strategy.
