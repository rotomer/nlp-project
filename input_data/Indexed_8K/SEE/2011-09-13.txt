Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company") is disclosing under Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K the information attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1, which information is incorporated herein by reference. This presentation, a portion of which has not been previously reported, is being provided to certain financial institutions in connection with the syndication of the Company's previously announced $1,200 million senior secured term loan B credit facility.
The information in this Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as may be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K and the information furnished herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by such words as "anticipates," "believes," "plan," "assumes," "could," "estimates," "expects," "will" and similar expressions. These statements include comments as to Sealed Air's beliefs and expectations as to future events and trends affecting Sealed Air's business. Examples of such forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the business combination transaction between Diversey and Sealed Air, potential synergies and cost savings, the potential accretion of the transaction to Sealed Air's earnings and free cash flow, future financial and operating results, the expected timing of the completion of the transaction and Sealed Air's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: general business and economic conditions; the competitive environment; the failure to realize synergies and cost savings from the transaction or delay in realization thereof; the businesses of Sealed Air and Diversey may not be combined successfully; and adverse effects of the merger on employee retention and on Sealed Air's and Diversey's business relationships with third parties, including key customers and distributors. For more extensive information, see "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," which appear in Sealed Air's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC, as may be updated by Sealed Air's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. While Sealed Air may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Sealed Air specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if estimates change and, therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.
