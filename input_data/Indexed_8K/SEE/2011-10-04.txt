     Section 7.8. . Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article Seven, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Notes shall have been
Successor Trustee by Merger
 
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes. In case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any successor Trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee. In all such cases such certificates shall have the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee shall have; , , that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Notes in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company
     Section 7.11. . (a) It is the purpose of this Indenture that there shall be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Indenture, and in particular in case of the enforcement thereof on default, or in the case the Trustee deems that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the powers, rights or remedies herein granted to the Trustee or hold title to the properties, in trust, as herein granted or take any action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that the Trustee appoint an individual or institution as a separate or co-trustee. The following provisions of Section 7.11 are adopted to these ends.
Appointment of Co-Trustee
     (b) In the event that the Trustee appoints an additional individual or institution as a separate or co-trustee, each and every remedy, power, right, claim, demand, cause of action, immunity, estate, title, interest and lien expressed or intended by this Indenture to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Trustee with respect thereto shall be exercisable by and vest in such separate or co-trustee but only to the extent necessary to enable such separate or co-trustee to exercise such powers, rights and remedies, and only to the extent that the Trustee by the laws of any jurisdiction is incapable of exercising such powers, rights and remedies, and every covenant and obligation necessary to the exercise thereof by such separate or co-trustee shall run to and be enforceable by either of them.
 
     (c) Should any instrument in writing from the Company be required by the separate or co-trustee so appointed by the Trustee for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations, any and all such instruments in writing shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Company; , , that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if the Company does not execute any such instrument within 15 days after request therefor, the Trustee shall be empowered as an attorney-in-fact for the Company to execute any such instrument in the Company's name and stead. In case any separate or co-trustee or a successor to either shall die, become incapable or acting, resign or be removed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations of such separate or co-trustee, so far as permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee until the appointment of a new trustee or successor to such separate or co-trustee.
provided
however
     (d) To the extent permitted by law, no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder.
     (e) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Indenture and the conditions of this Article Seven.
     (f) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Indenture on its behalf and in its name.

     Section 8.2. .

For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Notes of such series and to have satisfied all its other obligations under the Notes of such series and this Indenture (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (i) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust fund described in Section 8.8 and as more fully set forth in such Section; (ii) the Company's obligations with respect to the Notes of such series concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust; (iii) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and (iv) the provisions of this Indenture relating to Legal Defeasance.

For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby.

Under the terms of the agreement, Diversey shareholders will receive $2.1 billion in cash and 31.7 million shares of Sealed Air common stock valued at $16.70 per share for a total consideration to shareholders of $2.6 billion. Diversey, based in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, with approximately 10,000 employees and 2010 net sales of $3.1 billion, joins Sealed Air as a reportable segment. The leadership teams of both Diversey and Sealed Air will remain in their roles as integration planning continues.

We are excited to bring forward innovative solutions that will create measurable value for our customers, enhance the quality of life for consumers, and provide a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations."
 
     Mr. Hickey continued, "Since announcing the transaction, we have been actively engaged in integration planning to ensure that our new organization is ready day-one to achieve a smooth internal integration and a seamless transition for our customers. And, we have stayed on track to meet our goals. Looking ahead, we are excited about our ability to accelerate development projects, achieve our synergy targets and enhance our financial profile, which will generate solid free cash flow and greater value for Sealed Air and our various stakeholders."
