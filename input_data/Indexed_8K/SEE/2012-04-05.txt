"S EALED AIR'S GROWTH HAS ALWAYS COME FROM CHALLENGING OUR OWN
NOTION OF HOW OUR PRODUCTS PROTECT YOUR PRODUCTS.' BY HAVING THE COURAGE TO REDEFINE PROTECTION, WE HAVE ALWAYS MAXIMIZED THE VALUE WE OFFER AS CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER NEEDS EVOLVE."
to optimize our legacy internal operations, lower our cost structure, transition to a standard ERP system, revitalize our R&D pipeline, and build a solid balance sheetour team was ready to focus on the next 10 years as a period of transformational growth. While the Diversey transaction initially met with a mixed reaction from investors, I believe that our commitment to expand our leadership presence in food safety and security and facility hygiene is the right long-term strategy for the organization and Diversey was the right investment to drive long-term stockholder value. With Diversey, we are focused on being a global leader in sustainable solutions that improve food safety and security, facility hygiene and product protectionprotecting what is important: what you eat and drink, where you go and the valuable goods you ship.
The global business unit structure we expect to implement in 2012 will align three business areas to a specific protection theme: Food & Beverage, Institutional & Laundry, and Protective Packaging. Each business area will continue to leverage our expansive, shared global infrastructure and our core competencies in advanced material science, microbiology, food science and engineering to improve the efficiency and efficacy of protection solutions for customers worldwide. As we transition to this structure, our businesses will be focusing their attention and investments on a core growth strategy that emphasizes sustaining our current market footprint in North America, maintaining our leadership positions in the EMEA markets, and accelerating growth in developing regions. We believe this approach will ultimately generate the most growth opportunity, value and return on our investment.
As you will see in this year's annual report, the new Sealed Air is positioned to create measurable value for our customers and their operations through solutions that improve safety and risk management, drive operational efficiencies through automation and deliver water, waste and energy reduction. Additionally, we ensure downstream benefits such as extended shelf life, which reduces food waste, brand enhancement, and value-added convenience features for both customers and consumers.
I am excited about the opportunities ahead for Sealed Air based on what we have learned following the close of the Diversey transaction in October 2011. The diligent analysis of over ten integration teams has yielded 2013 goals that include cost synergy targets that are double our initial estimate and have reinforced our free cash flow targetscore to achieving our net debt target and long-term capital structure of a 3.0x to 3.5x net debt to EBITDA ratio by the end of 2013. These goals include:  -  $ 8.6 billion in annual revenue, including $70 million in rev-
enue synergies;
 -  $ 100 million in annual cost synergies;
 -  $ 1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA ($1.45 billion run-rate at
end-2013);
 -  $ 600 million in annual free cash flow; and  -  $ 4.5 billion in net debt.
Committed and Aligned to Achieve Success
Both senior management and the Board are committed to achieving a successful integration, realizing our 2013 goals, and delivering the earnings improvement and stockholder value creation that we expect will follow when we perform to plan over the next two years. To our disappointment, 2011 became a challenging year for our stockholders due to the significant decline in our stock price following the announcement of our Diversey acquisition. In response, the Board took a hard look at our strategy and took meaningful actions. We reaffirmed the strategic rationale supporting the Diversey transaction, appointed a new lead director, Mr. William Marino, and two additional independent Board members, and we aligned our incentive compensation programs to include our 2013 goals and total shareholder return (among other metrics).
As we move ahead and execute on our plans, we commit to our stockholders that we will:
 -  P ut our full effort into achieving the success of our deal;  -  S et clear, reasonable performance goals and communicate them;
 -  R eport on our progress toward achieving our goals; and  -  S hare our insights along the way.

DEAR STOCKHOLDERS:
Over the course of Sealed Air's fifty-year history, our Board members have developed and maintained a tradition of sound governance and management of the business with the highest standards of business ethics as outlined in Sealed Air's Code of Conduct. This commitment has led to solid business performance, even in challenging economic times.
2011 marked a year of transformation for Sealed Air through our investment in Diverseya transaction that we believe provides considerable long-term growth opportunities for the organization and solid value creation for our investors.
Having expanded Sealed Air's scope and size of operations following the acquisition, the Board enhanced governance practices to improve the facilitation of the Company's affairs by creating a Lead Director position and announced my appointment to this position. We believe that this change will continue to enhance the Company's corporate governance practices and more fully align the Company with stockholder interests, particularly as they relate to achieving the benefits of the recent acquisition.
The Board takes pride in the solid foundation the Company's leaders have achieved, the reputation of leading governance practices, and the balanced approach we have tried to consistently apply to align and meet the interests of our stockholders, customers and employees. We encourage our investors to read our annual report and proxy to become better acquainted with Sealed Air, to understand our commitment to the business and how we work hard to meet the interests of all of our stakeholders.

CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This annual report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report regarding our strategies, prospects, financial condition, costs, plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking statements so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. Some of our statements in this report, in documents incorporated by reference into this report and in our future oral and written statements may be forward-looking. These statements reflect our beliefs and expectations as to future events and trends affecting our business, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations concerning future events and discuss, among other things, anticipated future financial performance and future business plans. Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words as "anticipates," "believes," "plan," "assumes," "could," "should," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "potential," "seek," "predict," "may," "will" and similar expressions.
The following are important factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements: the implementation of our Settlement agreement regarding the various asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, successor liability, and indemnification claims made against the Company arising from a 1998 transaction with W. R. Grace & Co.; global economic conditions; credit ratings; changes in raw material pricing and availability; changes in energy costs; competitive conditions and contract terms; currency translation and devaluation effects, including in Venezuela; the success of our financial growth, profitability, cash generation and manufacturing strategies and our cost reduction and productivity efforts; the effects of animal and food-related health issues; pandemics; consumer preferences; environmental matters; regulatory actions and legal matters; successful integration and other information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1A, "Risk Factors." Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In our annual report, we present financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we present financial information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP, which we refer to as non-U.S. GAAP, as our management believes it is useful to investors. In addition, non-U.S. GAAP measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and, along with other data, as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts, assessing financial performance, providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers. The non-U.S. GAAP information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP information. It does not purport to represent any similarly titled U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under U.S. GAAP. Further, non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that we present may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by others. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-U.S. GAAP measures. Further, investors are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to arrive at these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.
Our management may assess our financial results, such as gross profit, operating profit and diluted net earnings per common share ("EPS"), both on a U.S. GAAP basis and on an adjusted non-U.S. GAAP basis. Examples of some other supplemental financial metrics our management will also use to assess our financial performance include Earnings before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Cash EPS and Free Cash Flow. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain one-time expenses and/or gains (which may not occur in each period presented) and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management's ability to make useful forecasts. Our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may also be considered in calculations of our performance measures set by the Organization and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors for purposes of determining incentive compensation.
The non-U.S. GAAP financial metrics mentioned above exclude items we consider unusual or special items and also exclude their related tax effects. We evaluate the unusual or special items on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or special item for purposes of determining our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things (i) its nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.

(4) These items represent special items and certain one-time charges principally associated with past restructuring programs for both Sealed Air and Diversey.
