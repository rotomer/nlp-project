(e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder, on the one hand, and by the Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall the Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by the Underwriter hereunder; , , that the liability of the Selling Stockholder pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed the product of (i) the number of Securities sold by the Selling Stockholder and (ii) the per share net proceeds to the Selling Stockholder as set forth in the Final Prospectus.

Benefits received by the Company and by the Selling Stockholder shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder, and benefits received by the Underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and selling agent of the Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the

No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.
(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Lender at its option may make any Advances by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Advances; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
