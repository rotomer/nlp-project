EXHIBIT 99 [LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: CONWAY G. IVY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CORPORATE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 216-566-2102 NEWS: - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Sherwin-Williams Company - 101 Prospect Avenue, N.W., Cleveland, Ohio 44115 - (216) 566-2140 CLEVELAND, Ohio - April 7, 2003 - The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) is meeting with security analysts on Tuesday, April 8th and will announce that consolidated sales for the first quarter of 2003 are expected to be slightly below the first quarter of 2002. On March 10, 2003, the Company estimated that first quarter sales this year would be the same as or slightly higher than last year's first quarter. More stringent inventory control by many retail customers due to the adverse impact of harsh weather on their sales in February and early March led to the lower estimate. For the first quarter of 2003, consolidated sales were adversely impacted by harsh weather conditions in parts of the United States. Paint Stores Segment architectural coatings sales began to recover in March from the February weather impact. Paint Stores Segment industrial maintenance and product finishes sales were weak during the quarter reflecting the continuation of a soft domestic economic environment. Consumer Segment sales were adversely impacted by stringent inventory control by many retail customers as a result of the harsh weather conditions. Sales in the Automotive Finishes Segment were adversely impacted by an overall decrease in repairable vehicles due to increased costs of repair. In the International Coatings Segment, sales were adversely impacted by unfavorable currency exchange rates. Volume gains were achieved by most International operations. Despite the lower-than-anticipated sales in the last half of March, the Company expects that its diluted net income per common share in the first quarter of 2003 will be in the low part of the range of $.20 to $.23 per share, which was provided on March 10, 2003. The Company's diluted income per common share before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002 was $.23 per share. The Company will release its first quarter financial results on Tuesday, April 22, 2003. For the full year 2003, sales are still expected to be up 3.0 to 5.0 percent over 2002 and diluted net income per common share is anticipated to be within the range of $2.17 to $2.29 per share with annual sales at that level. These expectations are the same as those provided on February 6, and March 10, 2003. The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866, is one of the world's leading companies engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers. 3
