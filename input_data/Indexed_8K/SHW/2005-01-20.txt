EXHIBIT 99
CLEVELAND, OHIO, January 19, 2005  The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) is updating its expectations for the fourth quarter and year 2004 which were last announced on October 21, 2004.
Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7 percent to $1.5 billion due primarily to better-than-expected domestic and foreign sales volume and 2004 acquisitions. The previous expectation for net sales in the fourth quarter had been an increase in the low double digits versus last year's fourth quarter. Net sales for the year 2004 increased 13.1 percent to $6.1 billion. The better-than-expected sales volume increases partially offset the impact of significantly rising raw material costs during the quarter. The Company's earnings were favorably impacted by a 2.0 percent reduction in the effective tax rate due to the effects of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Diluted net income per common share is expected to be $.57 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.72 per share for the year 2004. The previous expectation of diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter of 2004 was in the range of $.48 to $.52 per share while the previous expectation for the year 2004 was in the range of $2.62 to $2.66. The Company will release its full financial results for the fourth quarter and year 2004 on February 3, 2005.
     The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866, is one of the world's leading companies engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers.
