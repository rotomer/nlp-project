EXHIBIT 99 [LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: CONWAY G. IVY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CORPORATE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 216-566-2102 NEWS: - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Sherwin-Williams Company - 101 Prospect Avenue, N.W., Cleveland, Ohio 44115 - (216) 566-2140 CLEVELAND, OHIO, January 24, 2005 - The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW), due to a number of investor inquiries, is clarifying its previous press release of January 19, 2005 in which the Company updated its expectations for the fourth quarter and year 2004 which were last announced on October 21, 2004. The Company is also providing its earnings expectations for the full year 2005. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 16.7 percent to $1.5 billion due primarily to better-than-expected domestic and foreign sales volume and 2004 acquisitions. The previous expectation for net sales in the fourth quarter had been an increase in the low double digits versus last year's fourth quarter. Net sales for the year 2004 increased 13.1 percent to $6.1 billion. Diluted net income per common share is expected to be $.57 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.72 per share for the year 2004. The previous expectation of diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter of 2004 was in the range of $.48 to $.52 per share while the previous expectation for the year 2004 was in the range of $2.62 to $2.66. The Company's earnings were favorably impacted by a one-time special 2.0 percent reduction in the annual effective tax rate due to the effects of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that increased fourth quarter 2004 diluted net income per common share over previous Company expectations by approximately $.08 per share. In the fourth quarter 2004, sharply rising raw material costs were only partially offset by better-than-expected sales volume and an additional reduction in the annual effective tax rate due primarily to improved foreign operations (which was previously considered in fourth quarter and full year 2004 expectations). The Company expects its diluted net income per common share for the year 2005 will be in the range of $3.00 to $3.10 per share. The Company will release its full financial results for the fourth quarter and year 2004 and conduct its regularly scheduled conference call on February 3, 2005.
