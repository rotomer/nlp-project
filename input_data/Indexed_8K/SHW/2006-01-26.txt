EXHIBIT 99
CLEVELAND, OHIO, January 26, 2006  The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) announced its financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated net sales increased 17.6% in the year to $7.19 billion from $6.11 billion in 2004 and 14.1% in the fourth quarter to $1.71 billion from $1.50 billion last year. Acquisitions increased consolidated net sales $369.7 million, or 6.0%, in the year. The net effect of acquisitions and dispositions on consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter was negligible.
     Diluted net income per common share in 2005 increased 20.6% to $3.28 per share from $2.72 per share in 2004. Acquisitions increased diluted net income per common share approximately $.14 per share for the year 2005. Diluted net income per common share was $.54 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $.57 per share a year ago. In 2004, fourth quarter results were favorably impacted by approximately $.08 per share related to a reduction in the 2004 effective tax rate. Improved operating results in the fourth quarter of 2005 were partially offset by an asset impairment charge of $22.0 million, or approximately $.10 per share, due to an anticipated reduction in the Company's business at a major retailer beginning in 2006. Acquisitions had no impact on diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter of 2005.
     Paint Stores Segment net sales increased 21.9% in the year to $4.85 billion and 16.2% in the fourth quarter to $1.18 billion due primarily to continuing strong domestic architectural paint sales to contractor and DIY customers. Net sales from stores opened more than twelve calendar months increased 13.6% in the full year and 14.8% in the fourth quarter. The acquisition of Duron, Inc. in September 2004 added approximately 6.7% to this Segment's full year 2005 net sales. The Paint Stores Segment's operating profit increased 23.4% to $592.5 million in the full year and 22.9% to $141.8 million in the quarter due primarily to increased sales volume and strong expense control partially offset by significantly increased raw material costs.
     Consumer Segment net sales increased 7.7% to $1.40 billion in the year and 11.4% to $291.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 2004. Acquisitions increased net sales 7.7% in the full year and 2.2% in the fourth quarter. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 were reduced by a charge representing 3.9% of net sales due to the impairment of a customer sales incentive program. The remaining increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of 2005 was due primarily to sales to existing customers representing purchases that had been postponed in the third quarter due to managed inventory levels. Operating profit of this Segment decreased
 
$18.6 million, or 9.9%, to $169.1 million for the year and decreased $14.1 million to $.2 million in the fourth quarter. Operating profits of both periods were adversely impacted by increased raw material costs and the fourth quarter asset impairment charge.
     Automotive Finishes Segment net sales increased 7.1% to $550.8 million in the year versus 2004 and were essentially flat with last year in the fourth quarter at $131.8 million. The net sales gain for the year was due primarily to new product introductions and strong international sales. The comparison of fourth quarter net sales was negatively impacted by the disposition in the third quarter of 2005 of the majority interest in a joint venture in China that had sales of approximately $7.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. Currency exchange fluctuations in 2005 relative to last year increased net sales by 2.8% in both the fourth quarter and full year. Operating profit of this Segment in the year declined $.8 million, or 1.4%, to $57.2 million. This included a third quarter 2005 loss of $7.9 million sustained in the disposition of the China joint venture. Operating profit increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter to $15.2 million. The disposition of the China joint venture negatively impacted the fourth quarter operating profit comparison by 8.7%. Currency exchange fluctuations favorably impacted operating profit in the year by 5.0% and in the fourth quarter by 6.1%.
     International Coatings Segment net sales, stated in U. S. dollars, increased 21.8% to $388.0 million in the year and 19.1% to $101.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Sales results were favorably impacted by currency exchange fluctuations of 9.8% in the full year and 5.9% in the fourth quarter. Sales in local currency in the year and fourth quarter were positively impacted by pricing improvements in South America, partially offset by lower volume sales in the United Kingdom resulting from a difficult retail environment. Operating profit for this Segment, in U. S. dollars, increased in the year by 30.6% to $23.6 million from $18.0 million in 2004 and increased 3.7% in the fourth quarter to $7.8 million from $7.6 million last year. The increases in operating profits were due primarily to net sales gains, operating efficiencies related to additional manufacturing volume, tight expense control and favorable currency exchange fluctuations in South America. Operating profit of the United Kingdom businesses increased in the year on lower net sales and sales volume. However, in the fourth quarter, lower operating profits in the United Kingdom partially offset the increases in operating profit in South America.
     The Company purchased 2,050,000 shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter, bringing the total purchased to 8,076,000 shares in 2005. The Company had remaining authorization at December 31, 2005 to purchase 18,421,000 shares.
     Commenting on the financial results, Christopher M. Connor, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased that in 2005 we were able to report record sales of nearly $7.2 billion and record earnings of $3.28 per share. We are encouraged by the continuing double-digit sales gains achieved by our Paint Stores Segment and by the improvement of our International Coatings and Automotive Finishes Segments. We remain vigilant concerning the operations of our Consumer Segment, which are vulnerable to the fluctuating buying patterns of our customers. Though significant raw material cost increases in late 2004 and throughout 2005 had an adverse impact on our gross margins, we were able to implement certain price increases and take other actions in the fourth quarter that began to stabilize our ongoing gross margins.
     "In the first quarter of 2006, we anticipate achieving a high single to low double digit percentage increase in consolidated net sales versus the first quarter of 2005. We estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter of 2006 will be in the range of $.56 to $.61 per share compared to $.58 per share earned in the first quarter of 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company will record an additional expense relating to its stock option plans and we expect our effective tax rate to be higher than in the first
 
quarter of 2005. These items are expected to reduce diluted net income per share by $.08 per share in the first quarter of 2006. For the full year 2006, we expect to achieve a high single to low double digit percentage increase in consolidated net sales over 2005. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2006 will be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75 per share, including an estimated $.08 per share charge in the year for the additional expense relating to stock options, compared to $3.28 per share earned in 2005. For the full year 2006, we expect the annual effective tax rate to be slightly higher than the annual rate recognized in 2005."
