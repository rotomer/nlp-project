ARTICLE II AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF PURCHASES SECTION 2.01. Purchases of Receivables; Agreement to Purchase. (a) On the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Purchaser shall make the Initial Purchase hereunder on the Initial Purchase Date by purchasing from the Originator, and the Originator shall sell to the Purchaser without recourse except as expressly provided herein, all of the Originator's right, title and interest in and to all Receivables owned by it existing as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Initial Purchase Date, together with all Related Security relating to such Receivables and all Collections with respect to, and other proceeds of, the foregoing. On each Business Day after the Initial Purchase Date until the termination of this Agreement or the occurrence of the Purchase Termination Date, the Purchaser shall purchase from the Originator, and the Originator shall sell to the Purchaser without recourse except as expressly provided herein, all of the Originator's right, title and interest in and to all Receivables owned by the Originator existing as of the close of business on the immediately preceding Business Day which have not been previously Purchased hereunder, together with all Related Security relating to such Receivables and all Collections with respect to, and other proceeds of, the foregoing. Each Purchase described in the preceding sentence shall automatically occur on the date of such Purchase without any further action on the part of the Purchaser. (b) It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Purchase of Transferred Assets to be made hereunder shall be absolute and irrevocable and will provide the Purchaser with the full risks and benefits of ownership of such Transferred Assets so purchased (such that the Transferred Assets would not constitute property of the Originator's estate in the event of the Originator's bankruptcy) and shall constitute a "sale of accounts," as such term is used in Article 9 of the UCC of the State of New York, to the extent applicable, and not a loan secured by such Transferred Assets. If, notwithstanding such intention, the conveyance of the Transferred Assets from the Originator to the Purchaser shall ever be recharacterized as a secured loan and not as a sale, it is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall constitute a security 6
agreement under applicable law, and that the Originator shall be deemed to have granted, and the Originator hereby grants to the Purchaser, a duly perfected first priority security interest in all of the Originator's right, title and interest in, to and under the Transferred Assets, and all proceeds thereof, free and clear of any Adverse Claims to secure loans deemed to have been made by the Purchaser to the Originator and all other obligations of the Originator hereunder. Each sale of Receivables by the Originator to the Purchaser is made without recourse; provided, however, that (i) the Originator shall be liable to the Purchaser for all representations, warranties and covenants made by the Originator hereunder and (ii) such sale does not constitute and is not intended to result in an assumption by the Purchaser or any assignee thereof of any obligation or liability of the Originator or any other Person arising in connection with the Transferred Assets or any other obligations or liabilities of the Originator. In view of the intention of the parties hereto that the Purchases of Receivables to be made hereunder shall constitute a sale of such Receivables rather than a loan secured by such Receivables, the Originator agrees to (i) note on its financial statements that such Receivables have been sold to the Purchaser and (ii) on or prior to the Effective Date, mark its master data processing records relating to the Receivables with a legend acceptable to the Purchaser and the Program Agent, evidencing that the Purchaser has purchased such Receivables as provided in this Agreement. (c) The purchase price for each Purchase of Receivables by the Purchaser under this Agreement (the "Purchase Price") shall be an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) one minus the Required Discount (defined below) as of the date of such Purchase by (b) the Outstanding Balance of the Receivables purchased. The "Required Discount" shall be 2.00% or such other percentage as may be determined from time to time (but no less frequently than semiannually) by mutual agreement between the Originator and the Purchaser based on their respective assessments of the prevailing cost of funds, recent performance history of the Receivables being sold hereunder (including write-offs and rate of collection) and other costs of ownership, all determined on an arm's length basis. SECTION 2.02. Payment for the Purchases; Settlements. (a) The Purchase Price for each Purchase of Receivables (other than any Receivables contributed to the Purchaser's capital) that are in existence on the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Purchase Date (the "Initial Cutoff Date") shall be payable in full by the Purchaser to the Originator on the Initial Purchase Date, and shall be paid to the Originator in the following manner: (i) first, by delivery of immediately available funds, to the extent of funds made available to the Purchaser in connection with a borrowing of Loans under the Loan and Servicing Agreement or other cash on hand; (ii) second, by delivery of the proceeds of a subordinated revolving loan from the Originator to the Purchaser (a "Subordinated Loan") pursuant to the Subordinated Note in an amount not to exceed the least of (A) the remaining unpaid portion of such 7
Purchase Price, and (B) the maximum Subordinated Loan that could be borrowed without rendering the Purchaser's Net Worth less than the Required Capital Amount and (C) the maximum Subordinated Loan that could be borrowed without rendering the Net Value less than the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Loans (including the Subordinated Loan proposed to be made on such date); and (iii) third, by accepting such Receivables as a capital contribution to the Purchaser's capital in an amount equal to the remaining unpaid balance of such Purchase Price. Each Receivable coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be sold or contributed to the Purchaser on the Business Day immediately following the day such Receivable was originated and the Purchase Price for such Receivable shall be due and owing in full by the Purchaser to the Originator on such Business Day (except that the Purchaser may, with respect to any such Purchase Price, offset against such Purchase Price any amounts owed by the Originator to the Purchaser hereunder and which have become due but remain unpaid) and shall be paid to the Originator in the manner provided in the following paragraphs (b), (c) and (d). (b) The Purchase Price for each Receivable coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date and the Related Security and Collections shall be due and owing in full by the Purchaser to the Originator on the date it is purchased hereunder and shall be paid to the Originator in the following manner: (i) first, by delivery of immediately available funds, to the extent of funds made available to the Purchaser in connection with a borrowing of Loans under the Loan and Servicing Agreement or other cash on hand; (ii) second, by delivery of the proceeds of a Subordinated Loan, provided that the making of any such Subordinated Loan shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.02(a)(ii); and (iii) third, by accepting such Receivables as a contribution to the Purchaser's capital in an amount equal to the remaining unpaid balance of such Purchase Price; provided, that no such capital contribution shall be made from and after the Purchase Termination Date. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.02(a)(ii) and Section 2.02(e), the Originator irrevocably agrees to advance each Subordinated Loan requested by the Purchaser on or prior to the Purchase Termination Date. The Subordinated Loans shall be evidenced by, and shall be payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of, the Subordinated Note and shall be payable solely from funds which the Purchaser is not required under the Loan and Servicing Agreement to set aside for the benefit of, or otherwise pay over to, the Program Agent or the Lenders. The Originator is hereby authorized by the Purchaser to endorse on the schedule attached to the Subordinated Note an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each advance thereunder, as well as the date of each payment with respect thereto; provided that the failure to make such notation shall not affect any obligation of the Purchaser thereunder. 8
(c) Although the Purchase Price for each Receivable coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be paid in full by the Purchaser to the Originator on the date such Receivable is purchased, a precise reconciliation of the Purchase Price between the Purchaser and the Originator shall be effected on a monthly basis on each Settlement Date with respect to all Receivables sold during the month most recently ended prior to such Settlement Date and based on the information contained in the Monthly Report most recently delivered by the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.05 of the Loan and Servicing Agreement for such month. Although such reconciliation shall be effected on Settlement Dates, increases or decreases in the amount owing under the Subordinated Note made pursuant to Section 2.02(b) and any contribution of capital by the Originator to Purchaser made pursuant to Section 2.02(b) shall be deemed to have occurred and shall be effective as of the date that the Purchase Price is paid. On each Settlement Date, the Originator shall determine the net increase or the net reduction in the outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated Note occurring during the immediately preceding month and shall account for such net increase or net reduction in its books and records. The Originator hereby agrees that within three (3) Business Days after the Purchaser so requests, the Originator will provide the Purchaser with a current report of daily sales giving rise to Receivables purchased hereunder and a current daily report of Collections received. (d) Each contribution of a Receivable by the Originator to Purchaser shall be deemed to be a Purchase of such Receivable by the Purchaser for all purposes of this Agreement. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Originator shall have no obligation to make capital contributions to the Purchaser, in respect of the Originator's equity interest in the Purchaser or otherwise, in order to provide funds to pay the Purchase Price to the Originator under this Agreement or for any other reason. (e) If the Purchaser shall fail to make any payment of the applicable Purchase Price in respect of any Purchase on the date such Purchase Price is due hereunder then the Originator may, upon written notice to the Purchaser and the Program Agent (as assignee of the Purchaser), elect to terminate its obligation to sell Receivables, Collections and Related Security to the Purchaser hereunder and its obligation to make advances under the Subordinated Note. (f) If on any day, the Originator is deemed to have received a Deemed Collection with respect to any Receivable sold by it to the Purchaser hereunder, then, in such event, the Purchaser shall be entitled to a credit against the Purchase Price otherwise payable to the Originator hereunder in an amount equal to such Deemed Collection. If such Deemed Collection exceeds the Purchase Price for the Receivables sold on such day, then the Originator shall pay the remaining amount of such Deemed Collection in cash within five (5) Business Days thereafter; PROVIDED that if the Purchase Termination Date has not occurred, the Originator shall be allowed to deduct the remaining amount of such Deemed Collection from any indebtedness owed to it under the Subordinated Note to the extent permitted thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no credit to the Purchase Price may be made and no deduction to the indebtedness under the Subordinated Note may be made on or after the Termination 9
Date under the Loan and Servicing Agreement or at any time a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists under the Loan and Servicing Agreement. "DEEMED COLLECTIONS" means the aggregate of all amounts the Originator shall have been deemed to have received as a Collection of a Receivable sold by it. The Originator shall be deemed to have received a Collection (but only to the extent of the reduction or cancellation identified below) of a Receivable sold by it if at any time (i) the Outstanding Balance of any such Receivable is either (x) reduced or cancelled as a result of a Dilution Factor or (y) reduced or canceled as a result of any specific dispute, offset, counterclaim or defense whatsoever (in each case, except any such reduction, cancellation, dispute, offset, counterclaim or defense due to, or resulting from or relating to, the financial inability to pay or insolvency of the related Obligor) or (ii) any of the representations or warranties in Article III were not true with respect to such Receivable at the time of its sale hereunder (in which case, the Originator shall be deemed to have received a Collection in an amount equal to the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable). SECTION 2.03. Payments. All amounts to be paid by the Purchaser to the Originator or by the Originator to the Purchaser hereunder shall be paid in accordance with the terms hereof no later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in immediately available funds to such account as the Originator or the Purchaser, as the case may be, may from time to time specify in writing. In the event that any payment becomes due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. To the extent permitted by law, the Originator shall pay to the Purchaser, on demand, interest on all amounts not paid when due hereunder at 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect on the date such payment was due. All computations of interest payable hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed. SECTION 2.04. Transfer of Records to the Purchaser. (a) Each Purchase of Receivables hereunder shall include the transfer to the Purchaser of all the Originator's right and title to and interest in the Records relating to such Purchased Receivables, and the Originator hereby agrees that such transfer shall be effected automatically with each such Purchase, without any further action on the part of the parties hereto or any further documentation. (b) The Originator shall take such action reasonably requested by the Purchaser, from time to time hereafter, that may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the Purchaser has an enforceable ownership interest in the Records relating to the Purchased Receivables. (c) In connection with such transfer, the Originator hereby grants to each of the Purchaser, the Program Agent (as the Purchaser's assignee) and the Servicer an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, without royalty or payment of any kind, all software used by the Originator to account for the Receivables, whether such software is owned by the Originator or is owned by others and used by the Originator under license agreements with respect thereto; provided that should the consent of any licensor of such 10
software to grant the license described herein be required, the Originator hereby agrees that upon request by the Purchaser (or the Program Agent as the Purchaser's assignee), the Originator will use its reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third-party licensor. The license granted hereby shall be irrevocable, and shall terminate on the date this Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms. SECTION 2.05. Lock-Box and Deposit Account Transfer; Rights of the Purchaser. (a) The Originator hereby transfers to the Purchaser, as of the Effective Date, the exclusive ownership and control of the Lock-Boxes and the Deposit Accounts owned by it, and hereby agrees to take any further action necessary or that the Purchaser may reasonably request to effect such transfer. From and after the Effective Date, the Purchaser shall have the sole and exclusive right to withdraw or order a transfer of funds from the Deposit Accounts and to direct the investment of all funds therein, and each Deposit Account Bank shall be instructed to remit any amounts deposited in its Deposit Accounts solely according to the direction of the Purchaser. From and after the Effective Date, if the Originator, or its agents or representatives, shall at any time receive any cash, checks or other instruments constituting Collections, the Originator shall, or shall cause such recipient, to hold such payment in trust for and in a manner acceptable to the Purchaser and shall remit all such cash, checks and instruments, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer in accordance with the instructions of the Purchaser. (b) At any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an "Event of Termination" as defined in the Loan and Servicing Agreement, the Purchaser may notify the Obligors of the Purchased Receivables of the Purchaser's interest in the Transferred Assets and direct such Obligors that payment of all amounts payable under any Purchased Receivable be made directly to the Purchaser or its designee. At the Purchaser's request, the Originator shall, at its expense, give notice of the Purchaser's ownership of Transferred Assets to each related Obligor and assemble all related Records, and make the same available to the Purchaser at a place selected by the Purchaser or its designee. The Originator hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable power of attorney, with full power of substitution, coupled with an interest, to take in the name of the Originator any and all steps which are necessary or advisable to endorse, negotiate or otherwise realize on any writing or other right of any kind in connection with any Purchased Receivable or other Transferred Asset. (c) The Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of collections of any receivable which is not a Transferred Asset, turn over to the Originator such collections less all reasonable and appropriate out-of-pocket costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the Purchaser in collecting such receivables. The Purchaser shall have no obligation to collect, enforce or otherwise take any action with respect to any account receivable that is not a Transferred Asset other than to deliver any collections with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.05(c). 11
SECTION 2.06. Responsibilities of the Originator. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Originator shall (i) perform all of its obligations under the Contracts related to the Receivables transferred by it hereunder to the same extent as if such Receivables had not been transferred hereunder and the exercise by the Purchaser of its rights hereunder shall not relieve the Originator from such obligations and (ii) pay when due all sales, excise and personal property taxes payable in connection with the Purchased Receivables. SECTION 2.07. Further Action Evidencing Purchaser's Interest. The Originator agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further action, that the Purchaser may reasonably request in order to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the Purchaser's ownership of the Transferred Assets, or to enable the Purchaser to exercise or enforce any of its rights hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Originator will (i) code its master data processing records evidencing the Purchased Receivables to evidence that the Purchaser has purchased all right and title thereto and (ii) upon the request of the Purchaser, file such financing statements, continuation statements or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and execute and file such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate or as the Purchaser or its assigns may reasonably request. The Originator hereby authorizes the Purchaser or the Program Agent to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto and assignments thereof, relative to all or any of the Transferred Assets now existing or hereafter arising without the signature of, or further authorization by, the Originator. If after the occurrence and during the continuation of any Purchase Termination Event, the Originator fails to perform any of its respective agreements or obligations under this Agreement, the Purchaser may (but shall not be required to) itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Purchaser incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Originator upon the Purchaser's demand therefor. SECTION 2.08. Application of Collections. All Collections and other proceeds received from an Obligor in respect of Purchased Receivables shall, except as otherwise required by law, be applied to Purchased Receivables owed by such Obligor in a timely manner in accordance with the Originator's servicing practices. ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Originator. The Originator hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser on the Effective Date and on the date of each Purchase hereunder as follows, provided that this Section 3.01 shall not include any representations or warranties that are not correct due to the occurrence and continuation of an Incipient Judgment Event with respect to which the Incipient Judgment Event Grace Period has not lapsed: (a) Due Formation and Good Standing. It is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in every jurisdiction where the nature 12
of its business requires it to be so qualified except where the failure to so qualify could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (b) Due Authorization and No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement and all other Facility Documents to which it is a party, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are within its corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, on its part and do not contravene or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or of its certificate or its articles of incorporation or by-laws, or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon it that could have a Material Adverse Effect or result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on any asset of it upon or with respect to any of its properties. This Agreement and the other Facility Documents to which it is a party have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Originator. (c) Governmental Approvals. No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered by it hereunder that has not already been given or obtained, except for filings under the UCC required under Article II. (d) Enforceability of Facility Documents. Each of this Agreement and each other Facility Document to be delivered by it in connection herewith, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance with its respective terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. (e) No Litigation. Except as publicly disclosed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against, or to the knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Originator after due inquiry, threatened against the Originator or any of its subsidiaries (i) that could reasonably be expected to be adversely determined, and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that seeks to prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Facility Documents. The Originator is not in default with respect to any order of any court, arbitrator or other Governmental Authority, which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Facility Documents. (f) Perfection of Interest in Transferred Assets. Each Receivable transferred by it hereunder is owned by it immediately prior to such transfer free and clear of any Adverse Claim, and, after such transfer, the Purchaser will have acquired a valid and perfected first priority ownership interest or security interest in each such Purchased Receivable so transferred, and in the Related Security, Collections and other Transferred Assets with respect thereto, in each case free and clear of any Adverse Claim. No effective financing statement or other instrument similar in effect, is filed in any 13
appropriate recording office listing the Originator as debtor or seller, covering any Transferred Assets except such as may be filed in favor of the Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement, or in favor of the Program Agent in accordance with the Loan and Servicing Agreement. (g) Compliance with Laws. The Originator has complied in all respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards applicable to it or its property, except where such compliance is being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings and except where the failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (h) Accuracy of Information. All written information heretofore furnished by it or any of its Affiliates to the Purchaser, the Program Agent, any Managing Agent or any Lender for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement, the Loan and Servicing Agreement, any of the other Facility Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby is, and all such written information hereafter furnished by the Originator or any of its Affiliates to the Purchaser, the Program Agent, any Managing Agent or any Lender will be, true and accurate in every material respect on the date such written information is stated or certified and does not and will not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading. (i) Location of Chief Executive Office and Records; Organizational Identification Number. The location of its principal place of business and chief executive office, the locations of the offices where it keeps all the Records, its form of organization, sole jurisdiction of organization, federal employer identification number and organizational identification number (if any) are correctly set forth on Exhibit B. The Originator has had no chief executive office in the past five (5) years other than that set forth on Exhibit B. (j) Collection Information. The names and addresses of all the Alternate Payment Locations, Approved Sub-servicers, Deposit Account Banks and Lock-Box Processors, together with the addresses of the Lock-Boxes and the account numbers of the Deposit Accounts of the Originator are as specified in Exhibit C. The Alternate Payment Locations and the Lock-Boxes set forth on Exhibit C are the only addresses to which Obligors and Approved Sub-servicers of Purchased Receivables are directed to make payment. The Deposit Accounts set forth on Exhibit C are the only accounts to which Obligors, Approved Sub-servicers or Lock-Box Processors remit Collections of Purchased Receivables by wire transfer or electronic funds transfer. The Originator has not granted any Person "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-102 of any applicable enactment of the UCC) of any Deposit Account or the right to take control of any Deposit Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event. 14
(k) No Trade Names. The Originator has no, and has not used, any trade names, fictitious names, assumed names or "doing business as" names, in connection with the Contracts or the Receivables other than those set forth on Exhibit B. (l) Ownership. As of the date hereof, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Purchaser are directly owned of record by the Originator, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and there are no options, warrants or other rights to acquire any shares of capital stock of the Purchaser. (m) Facility Documents. The Facility Documents represent all agreements between the Originator and the Purchaser relating to the transfer of the Purchased Receivables except for other agreements related to the transactions that are permitted by Section 4.03(g). (n) Solvency. The Originator: (i) is not "insolvent" (as such term is defined in Section 101(32)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code), (ii) is able to pay its debts as they come due; and (iii) does not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged or for any business or transaction in which it is about to engage. (o) Investment Company Act. The Originator is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. (p) Use of Proceeds. No proceeds of any Purchase will be used by it to acquire any security in any transaction which is subject to Section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (q) Taxes. The Originator has filed, caused to be filed or received an extension of the time to file, all United States Federal income tax returns (if any) and all other tax returns which are required to be filed by it and has paid or caused to be paid all material taxes, assessments or governmental charges of any kind that are due and payable by it pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Originator; provided that the Originator may contest in good faith any such taxes, assessments and other charges and, in such event, may permit the taxes, assessments or other charges so contested to remain unpaid during any period, including appeals, when the Originator is in good faith contesting the same, so long as (i) adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enforcement of the contested tax, assessment or other charge is effectively stayed for the entire duration of such contest if such enforcement could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) any tax, assessment or other charge determined to be due, together with any interest or penalties thereon, is promptly paid as required after final resolution of such contest. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Originator in respect of taxes and other governmental charges are, in the Originator's opinion, adequate. (r) Eligibility of Purchased Receivables. Each Purchased Receivable included as an Eligible Receivable in the calculation of the Net Receivables Pool 15
Balance on the date of its purchase hereunder satisfies the requirements of eligibility contained in the definition of "Eligible Receivable" as of such date. (s) Payments to Originator. With respect to each Receivable transferred to the Purchaser hereunder, the Purchase Price received by the Originator constitutes reasonably equivalent value in consideration thereof. No transfer by the Originator to the Purchaser of a Receivable has been made for or on account of an antecedent debt owned by the Originator to the Purchaser and no such sale is or may be voidable or subject to avoidance under any section of the Bankruptcy Code. (t) Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2004, no event has occurred which would have a Material Adverse Effect. (u) Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy. It has complied in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with regard to its origination of each Purchased Receivable and the related Contract and has not made any change to such Credit and Collection Policy other than as permitted under Section 4.03(c). (v) ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other ERISA Events, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Sherwin-Williams and the Subsidiaries have not incurred any material accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of ERISA. As used in this Section, "material" means the measure of a matter of significance that shall be determined as being an amount equal to 10% of Consolidated Net Worth. (w) Financial Statements. (i) The consolidated balance sheet of the Originator and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, contained in the report on Form 10-K filed by the Originator with the Securities and Exchange Commission, fairly present, in conformity with GAAP, the consolidated financial position of the Originator and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such fiscal year. (ii) The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Originator and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the nine months then ended, contained in the report on Form 10-K filed by the Originator with the Securities and Exchange Commission, fairly present in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the financial statements referred to in clause (i) above (except as described in the notes thereto), the financial position of the Originator and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such nine-month period (subject to normal year-end adjustments). 16
(x) No Purchase Termination Events. Immediately after giving effect to each Purchase, no Purchase Termination Event has occurred. (y) Accounting. The manner in which the Originator accounts for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is consistent with the "true sale" opinion to be rendered by Jones Day on the date hereof.

Indemnities by the Originator. Without limiting any other rights which the Purchaser may have hereunder or under applicable law (including, without limitation, the right to recover damages for breach of contract), the Originator hereby agrees to indemnify the Purchaser, its successors, transferees and assigns, and the officers, directors, agents, and employees of the foregoing (each, an "Originator Indemnified Party"), from and against any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities and related costs and expenses, including reasonable external attorneys' fees and disbursements (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "Originator Indemnified Amounts") awarded against or incurred by any Originator Indemnified Party to the extent relating to or arising from or as a result of this Agreement or the acquisition by the Purchaser of the Transferred Assets, subject to the proviso set forth below. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing indemnification, the Originator shall indemnify the Originator Indemnified Parties for Originator Indemnified Amounts to the extent relating to or resulting from any of the following: 26

furnish such goods or services (other than as a result of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the related Obligor); (x) the commingling of Collections with any other funds; (xi) any failure by the Purchaser to give reasonably equivalent value to the Originator in consideration for the transfer by the Originator to the Purchaser of any Transferred Assets, or any attempt by any Person to void any such transfer under any statutory provision or common law or equitable action, including, without limitation, any provision or the Bankruptcy Code; (xii) the failure of any Lock-Box Processor or Deposit Account Bank to remit any amounts or items of payment held in a Deposit Account or in a Lock-Box pursuant to the instructions of the Program Agent given in accordance with the Loan and Servicing Agreement, the applicable Lock-Box Processor Agreement, Blocked Account Agreement or the other Facility Documents, whether by reason of the exercise of setoff rights or otherwise; (xiii) any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to this Agreement or the use of proceeds of purchases made pursuant to this Agreement or any other Facility Document delivered hereunder or in respect of any of the Transferred Assets; (xiv) any claim brought by any Person arising from any activity by the Originator in servicing, administering or collecting any Purchased Receivable; (xv) the transfer by the Originator of any Purchased Receivable in violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (xvi) the failure of the Originator to furnish accurate and complete documentation (including, without limitation, a Contract or invoice) to any Obligor; or (xvii) the failure of any Lock-Box Processor, Approved Sub-servicer or any other third party with a contractual relationship with the Originator for the acceptance or processing of Collections to remit any Collections received by it to a Lock-Box or a Deposit Account within two (2) Business Days of receipt; provided, however, that the Originator shall not be required to indemnify any Originator Indemnified Party to the extent of any amounts (x) resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Originator Indemnified Party, or (y) constituting credit recourse for the failure of an Obligor to pay a Purchased Receivable, or (z) constituting net income or franchise taxes that are imposed by the United States or franchise taxes or net income taxes that are imposed on such Originator Indemnified Party by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Originator Indemnified Party is organized or any political subdivision thereof. Any amounts subject to the indemnification provisions of this Section 6.01 shall be paid by the Originator to the related Originator Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days, following written demand therefor. 28
SECTION 6.02. Limited Liability of Originator Indemnified Parties. No Originator Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Originator or any of their security holders or creditors for or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such liability is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from such Originator Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of its obligations under this Agreement. In no event, however, shall any Originator Indemnified Party be liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings). ARTICLE VII MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 7.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment to or waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure herefrom by the Originator shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all parties hereto and the Program Agent. Any such waiver, consent or approval shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Originator in any case shall entitle the Originator to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. This Agreement and the Loan and Servicing Agreement, together with the other written agreements required to be delivered hereunder and thereunder and the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto, contains a final and complete integration of all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall constitute the entire agreement (together with the exhibits hereto) among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior oral or written understandings.

All such notices and communications shall be effective, upon receipt, or in the case of overnight courier, two (2) days after being deposited with such courier, or, in the case of notice by facsimile, when electronic confirmation of receipt is obtained, in each case addressed as aforesaid. SECTION 7.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Purchaser to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. SECTION 7.04. Binding Effect; Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Originator and the Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The Originator may not assign any of its rights and obligations hereunder or 29
any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Purchaser and the Program Agent. The Purchaser may not assign its rights hereunder and in the Transferred Assets to any Person other than in connection with the Loan and Servicing Agreement. This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the Originator until the Final Collection Date; provided, however, that the rights and remedies with respect to (i) any breach of any representation and warranty made by the Originator pursuant to Article III, (ii) the indemnification and payment provisions of Article VI and (iii) Sections 7.06, 7.08 and 7.12 shall be continuing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement. SECTION 7.05. Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal court sitting in New York City in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent they may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. (b) Each of the Purchaser and the Originator consents to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to it at its address specified in Section 7.02. Nothing in this Section 7.05 shall affect the right of the Purchaser or the Originator to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. SECTION 7.06. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER FACILITY DOCUMENT. SECTION 7.07. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. SECTION 7.08. Costs, Expenses and Taxes.

Originator shall only be responsible for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with one audit of the Originator during any twelve (12) month period beginning on the date hereof and on each anniversary of the date hereof, and in each case, so long as (x) no Purchase Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing and (y) the results of the previous audits were complete and reasonably acceptable to the Program Agent and (ii) all reasonable costs and expenses of the Purchaser in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery (including any requested amendments, waivers or consents) of this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of special counsel for the Purchaser with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Purchaser as to its rights and remedies under this Agreement, and the other agreements executed pursuant hereto and (iii) all costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of outside counsel), in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other agreements and documents to be delivered hereunder after the occurrence of a Purchase Termination Event. (b) In addition, the Originator shall pay any and all stamp, sales, transfer and other taxes and fees (including, without limitation, UCC filing fees and any penalties associated with the late payment of any UCC filing fees) payable or determined to be payable by it in connection with the execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement or the other agreements and documents to be delivered hereunder (including any UCC financing statements) and agrees to indemnify the Purchaser (and its assigns) against any liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay by the Originator in paying or omission to pay such taxes and fees. SECTION 7.09. Execution in Counterparts; Severability. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 7.10. Termination of this Agreement. The agreement of the Originator to transfer Receivables hereunder and the agreement of the Purchaser to Purchase Receivables shall automatically terminate on the Purchase Termination Date. Notwithstanding any such termination described above, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as provided in Section 7.04. On or after the Final Collection Date, the Purchaser will, at the request and expense of the Originator, execute and deliver to the Originator such UCC termination statements and other documents as the Originator may reasonably request to evidence such termination. SECTION 7.11. Purchaser's Assignment of Rights to Program Agent. The Originator acknowledges that all of the Purchaser's right, title and interest in, to and under this Agreement 31
and each other document, agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith or therewith, constitutes part of the Collateral pledged to the Program Agent, and that, pursuant to and subject to the limitations contained in, and the terms and conditions of, the Loan and Servicing Agreement, the Purchaser has assigned to the Program Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, all benefits, rights and remedies exercisable by the Purchaser under this Agreement and each other document, agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith or therewith. Such assignment includes, without limitation, (x) all monies due and to become due to the Purchaser from the Originator, whether in connection with forwarding Collections of Purchased Receivables or any expenses, costs, indemnities, or damages for the breach of this Agreement or otherwise and (y) all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of the Purchaser against the Originator under or with respect to this Agreement (whether arising pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as otherwise available at law or in equity). The Originator acknowledges that the Program Agent shall have the sole right to enforce the Purchaser's rights and remedies under this Agreement to the extent permitted by the Loan and Servicing Agreement (including, without limitation, the right to give or withhold any consents or approvals of the Purchaser to be given or withheld hereunder, and, in any case, without regard to whether specific reference is made to the Purchaser's assigns in the provisions of this Agreement which set forth such rights and remedies) and the Originator agrees to cooperate fully with the Program Agent and the Lenders in the exercise of such rights and remedies; provided, however, that the Program Agent shall not be obligated to perform any of the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement. The Originator acknowledges that the rights of the Program Agent with respect to the rights and remedies in connection with any indemnification or any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by the Originator under this Agreement shall be continuing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The Originator further agrees to give to the Program Agent copies of all notices it is required to give to the Purchaser hereunder. SECTION 7.12. Limited Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement shall be payable solely out of Collections as they are received by or are available to the Purchaser to make such payments as provided pursuant to Section 2.06 or 2.07 of the Loan and Servicing Agreement, as applicable, and, to the extent Collections are not available to pay such obligations, the claims relating thereto shall not constitute a claim (as defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) against the Purchaser but shall continue to accrue. The Originator agrees that the payment by the Purchaser of any claim of any the Originator hereunder shall be subordinated in the priority for such claim in as set forth in Section 2.07 of the Loan and Servicing Agreement. The Originator hereby agrees that it will not institute any Event of Bankruptcy against the Purchaser so long as any Borrower Obligations shall be outstanding or there shall not have elapsed one year plus one day since the last day on which any such Borrower Obligations shall have been outstanding. SECTION 7.13. Integration. This Agreement executed by the parties hereto on the date hereof contains the final and complete integration of all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof superseding all prior oral or written understandings. 32

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, SWC Receivables Funding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Borrower"), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of The Sherwin-Williams Company, an Ohio Corporation (the "Lender"), in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, the aggregate unpaid principal sum provided for in Section 3 hereof in accordance with the terms of that certain Purchase and Contribution Agreement dated as of February 1, 2006 between the Lender and the Borrower (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement"). Reference to Section 2.02 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby made for a statement of the terms and conditions under which the loans evidenced hereby have been and will be made. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Purchase Agreement. 2. Interest. The Borrower further promises to pay interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount of this Subordinated Note from the date hereof until payment in full hereof at a per annum rate (the "Interest Rate") equal to the Base Rate in effect from time to time; provided, however, that if the Borrower shall default in the payment of any principal hereof, the Borrower promises to, on demand, pay interest at the rate of the Interest Rate plus 2% on any such unpaid amounts, from the date such payment is due to the date of actual payment. Interest shall be payable on the first Business Day of each accounting month in arrears and shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such accounting month and a year consisting of 360 days; provided, however, that the Borrower may elect on the date any interest payment is due hereunder to defer such payment and upon such election the amount of interest due but unpaid on such date shall constitute principal under this Subordinated Note. 3.

4. Subordination. The indebtedness evidenced by this Subordinated Note is subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Borrower's obligations under that certain Loan and Servicing Agreement dated as of February 1, 2006 (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Loan and Servicing Agreement") among the Borrower, the Lender, as servicer (the "Servicer"), the entities from time to time party thereto as conduit lenders (the "Conduit Lenders"), the financial institutions from time to time party thereto as committed lenders and managing agents (the "Committed Lenders" and "Managing Agents"), and Citicorp North America, Inc., as program agent (the "Program Agent").

Should any payment, distribution or security or proceeds thereof be received by the Lender in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, the Lender agrees that such payment shall be segregated, received and held in trust for the benefit of, and deemed to be the property of, and shall be immediately paid over and delivered to the Program Agent for the benefit of the Senior Claimants. 5.

This Subordinated Note shall not be amended, modified or terminated except in accordance with Section 7.01 of the Purchase Agreement. 7. Governing Law.

ARTICLE II AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE LOANS SECTION 2.01. The Loans. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, on the Effective Date, and thereafter from time to time prior to the Termination Date, each Conduit Lender may in its sole discretion, and each Committed Lender shall, if the Conduit Lender in its related Lender Group elects not to, make Loans to the Borrower in an amount, for each Lender Group, equal to its Lender Group Percentage of the amount requested by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.02; provided that no Lender shall make any such Loan if, after giving effect to such Loan: (i) the aggregate outstanding Principal Balance of the Tranches funded by such Lender hereunder shall exceed its Conduit Lending Limit (in the case of a Conduit Lender) or Commitment (in the case of a Committed Lender); (ii) the Aggregate Principal Balance shall exceed the lesser of the Facility Limit and the Maximum Permitted Amount; (iii) the sum of (A) the aggregate Face Amount of Promissory Notes issued by the Conduit Lender(s) in such Lender Group to fund or maintain the Loans hereunder and (B) the aggregate outstanding Principal Balance of the Tranches funded hereunder by the Lenders in such Lender Group other than through the issuance of Promissory Notes, shall exceed the Lender Group Limit for such Lender Group; and (iv) the Aggregate Principal Balance shall exceed the Borrowing Base. If there is more than one Committed Lender in a Lender Group, each such Committed Lender shall lend its Pro Rata Share of such Lender Group's Lender Group Percentage of each requested Loan, to the extent such Loan is not made by the related Conduit Lender. Each Borrowing shall be in a minimum principal amount equal to $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. Subject to the foregoing and to the limitations set forth in Section 2.05, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow the Loans hereunder. (b) Reduction of the Facility Limit. The Borrower may, from time to time upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to each Managing Agent, elect to reduce the Facility Limit in whole or in part, provided that after giving effect to any such reduction and any principal payments on such date, the Aggregate Principal Balance shall not exceed the Facility Limit. Any such reduction shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, provided further that any such reduction 31
shall effect a ratable reduction of the Commitments of each Committed Lender and of each Lender Group's Lender Group Limit. Once the Facility Limit is reduced pursuant to this Section 2.01(b) it may not subsequently be reinstated without the consent of each Committed Lender. (c) Extension of Scheduled Termination Date. The Borrower may, no more frequently than once each year by delivering written notice to the Managing Agents (with a copy to the Program Agent and the Conduit Lenders), request the Lenders to extend the date set forth in clause (i) of the definition of "Scheduled Termination Date" (the "Commitment Termination Date") for an additional 364 days past the then applicable Commitment Termination Date, with such extension to become effective with respect to any Lender Group, as of the date one or more Committed Lenders having Commitments equal to 100% of such Lender Group's Lender Group Limit shall in their sole discretion consent to such extension (the Lenders in such a Lender Group, "Extending Lenders.") Any such request shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) at no time will any Commitment have a term of more than 364 days and, if any such request would result in a term of more than 364 days, such request shall be deemed to have been made for such number of days so that, after giving effect to such extension on the date requested, such term will not exceed 364 days, (ii) none of the Lenders will have any obligation to extend any Commitment, (iii) any such extension of the Commitment Termination Date will be effective only upon the written agreement of at least one Committed Lender and the Borrower and (iv) any request for such extension shall be made at least sixty (60) days prior to the then current Commitment Termination Date. The Managing Agent for each applicable Committed Lender will respond to any such request within thirty (30) days but in any event no earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the then current Commitment Termination Date, provided, that any Managing Agent's failure to respond within such period shall be deemed to be a rejection of the requested extension. (d) Cash Secured Advance Commencement Date. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Cash Secured Advance Commencement Date for any Lender Group, the Borrower shall notify the Managing Agent for such Lender Group if the Seller wishes the Committed Lenders in such Lender Group to make the advances described in this Section. Following such notice, on the Cash Secured Advance Commencement Date for such Lender Group, each Committed Lender in such Lender Group shall, and severally agrees to, make an advance to the Borrower in Dollars in an amount equal to the excess of (i) such Committed Lender's Commitment over (ii) the unpaid Principal Balance of Loans held by such Committed Lender on such date (including Loans purchased or to be purchased on such date pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement to which such Committed Lender is a party), and such Committed Lender shall make such advance by causing an amount equal to such advance to be deposited in same day funds into the Collateral Advance Account. 32
SECTION 2.02. Borrowing Procedures. (a) Borrowing Requests. (i) The Borrower shall request a Borrowing hereunder by submitting to the Program Agent a written notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit B (each, a "Borrowing Request") not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing (or if the interest rate for the applicable Tranche is computed with reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate by such time on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing) (each, a "Borrowing Date"), provided, however, that if the Conduit Lenders have declined to fund any Borrowing Request and the Borrower is requesting that all Loans to be made on such Borrowing Date accrue Interest at the Base Rate, the Borrower shall submit such Borrowing Request on the Borrowing Date. Promptly after its receipt thereof, the Program Agent shall submit a copy of each Borrowing Request to each Managing Agent who shall promptly forward a copy thereof to the Lenders in its Lender Group. (ii) Each Borrowing Request shall: (A) specify (1) the amount of the requested Borrowing and the allocation of such amount among the Lender Groups (which shall be proportional to the respective Conduit Lending Limits of the Conduit Lenders in each Lender Group), (2) the Aggregate Principal Balance after giving effect to such Borrowing, (3) the desired Borrowing Date, and (4) the account of the Borrower to which the proceeds of such Borrowing are to be remitted, and (B) certify that, after giving effect to the proposed Borrowing, no Borrowing Base Deficiency would exist. (b) Conduit Lender Acceptance or Rejection. If a Conduit Lender shall receive a Borrowing Request, such Conduit Lender shall instruct the related Managing Agent to accept or reject such request by no later than the close of business on the Business Day immediately following the date of the applicable Borrowing Request. If a Conduit Lender rejects a Borrowing Request, the related Managing Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the related Committed Lenders of such rejection. If a Conduit Lender declines to fund its portion of any Borrowing Request, the Borrower may cancel and rescind such Borrowing Request in its entirety upon notice thereof received by the Program Agent and each Managing Agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the proposed Borrowing Date. At no time will a Conduit Lender be obligated to make Loans hereunder regardless of any notice given or not given pursuant to this Section. (c) Committed Lender's Commitment. (i) If a Conduit Lender rejects a Borrowing Request and the Borrower has not cancelled such Borrowing Request in accordance with clause (b) above, any Loan requested by the Borrower in such Borrowing Request that would otherwise be made by such Conduit Lender shall be made by the related Committed Lenders in its Lender Group on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares of such Loan; provided, however, that during the Term Period, if any, each Committed Lender shall, at least two Business Days prior to the date 33
of such Borrowing, instruct the Program Agent, to wire (or otherwise transfer in immediately available funds) on the date of such Borrowing to the Borrower at the account specified by the Borrower such Committed Lenders' Pro Rata Share of the amount of the Borrowing to be made by its Lender Group out of the funds available therefor in the Collateral Advance Account. (ii) The obligations of any Committed Lender to make Loans hereunder are several from the obligations of any other Committed Lenders (whether or not in the same Lender Group). The failure of any Committed Lender to make Loans hereunder shall not release the obligations of any other Committed Lender (whether or not in the same Lender Group) to make Loans hereunder, but no Committed Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Committed Lender to make any Loan hereunder. (iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Committed Lender shall not be obligated to fund any Loan at any time on or after the Termination Date or if, after giving effect to such Loan, the aggregate outstanding Loans funded by such Committed Lender hereunder would exceed an amount equal to (i) such Committed Lender's Commitment less (ii) such Committed Lender's ratable share of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Loans held by the Conduit Lender(s) in such Committed Lender's Lender Group. (d) Disbursement of Funds. On each Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender (other than the Lenders in a Term Period) shall remit its share of the aggregate amount of the Loans requested by the Borrower to the account of its related Managing Agent specified therefor to such Lender by 1:30 p.m. (New York City time) by wire transfer of same day funds (or during the Term Period for any Lender Group such funds will be so wired from the Collateral Advance Account by the applicable Managing Agent). Upon receipt of such funds, each Managing Agent shall remit such funds by wire transfer of same day funds to the account of the Borrower specified in the related Borrowing Request by 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) to the extent it has received such funds from the Lenders in its Lender Group no later than 1:30 p.m. (New York City time). Upon any disbursement made from the Collateral Advance Account to fund a Borrowing, each Term Out Lender will be deemed to have paid to the Borrower such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Lender Group's amount of the Borrowing being made for all purposes of this Agreement. SECTION 2.03. Tranches. (a) Generally. Each Loan shall be allocated to one or more "Tranche Periods" as set forth in the definition of such term. Any portion of a Loan having one Tranche Period and one Rate Type is referred to herein as a "Tranche". The Borrower shall from time to time select Tranche Periods and Rate Types with respect to Tranches funded by the Committed Lenders, subject to the provisions of this Agreement and provided that no Event of Termination has occurred. At all times after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Termination, each Committed Lender shall select the Tranche Periods and Rate Types with respect to the Tranches it funds hereunder. Either the Borrower or, following an Event of Termination and during the continuation thereof, the applicable Lender, may, upon notice to the other party received at least three Business Days prior to the last day of any Tranche Period in the case of the Borrower giving notice, or up to the last day of such Tranche Period in the case of 34
the Lender giving notice, either (i) divide any Tranche originating on such last day or having a Tranche Period ending on such last day into two or more Tranches having an aggregate Principal Balance equal to the Principal Balance of such divided Tranche, or (ii) combine any two or more Tranches originating on such last day or having Tranche Periods ending on such last day into a single Tranche having a Principal Balance equal to the aggregate of the Principal Balance of such Tranches; provided, however, that no Tranche with respect to which Interest is determined by reference to the CP Rate may be combined with a Tranche with respect to which Interest is determined by reference to the Alternate Rate, and a Tranche held by one Lender may not be combined with any Tranche held by any other Lender. (b) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the adoption of or any change in any Law or in the interpretation or application thereof by any relevant Governmental Authority shall make it unlawful for any Lender, in its reasonable determination, to fund or maintain Tranches for which Interest is calculated by reference to the LIBO Rate (each a "LIBOR Tranche") as contemplated by this Agreement or to obtain in the interbank Eurodollar market the funds with which to make or maintain any such LIBOR Tranche, such Lender shall promptly notify the Program Agent, its Managing Agent and the Borrower thereof whereupon, until such Lender notifies the Borrower and the Program Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligation of such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Tranches shall forthwith be suspended and (ii) such Lender's then outstanding LIBOR Tranches, if any, shall be converted on the last day of the Tranche Period for such Tranches or within such earlier period as required by Law into Tranches that accrue Interest based on the Base Rate (each a "Base Rate Tranche"). Before giving any notice to the Program Agent, its Managing Agent and the Borrower pursuant to this clause (b), such Lender shall designate a different office as its lending office if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. (c) LIBO Rate Inadequate; Inability to Determine LIBO Rate. If prior to the commencement of any Tranche Period for a LIBOR Tranche, either (i) the related Lender reasonably determines that the rate at which deposits of Dollars are being offered to such Lender in the London interbank market does not accurately reflect the cost to such Lender of funding or maintaining LIBOR Tranches for such Tranche Period or (ii) the related Lender is unable, after reasonable attempts, to obtain Dollars in the London interbank market to fund or maintain such Tranche for such Tranche Period, then such Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower, its Managing Agent and the Program Agent by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until such Lender notifies the Borrower, its Managing Agent and the Program Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (A) the obligations of the such Lender to make LIBOR Tranches or to continue or convert outstanding Tranches as or into LIBOR Tranches shall be suspended, (B) each outstanding LIBOR Tranche funded by such Lender shall be converted into a Base Rate Tranche on the last day of the Tranche Period applicable thereto, and (C) if any Borrowing Request requests a LIBOR Tranche, the portion of such Borrowing to be funded by such Lender shall be made as a Base Rate Tranche. SECTION 2.04. Interest and Fees. On each Interest Payment Date for a Tranche, the Borrower shall pay to each Lender (or its related Managing Agent) all accrued and unpaid Interest with respect to such Tranche. The Borrower shall pay to each Managing Agent the 35
Liquidity Fees and Program Fees in the amounts and on the dates set forth in each of the Fee Letters. On or before the first Business Day after the end of each Tranche Period in respect of which Interest is computed by reference to the CP Rate, the related Lender (or the related Managing Agent on behalf of such Lender) shall furnish the Borrower with an invoice setting forth the amount of the accrued and unpaid Interest for such Tranche Period. On or before the first Business Day after the end of each calendar month each Managing Agent shall furnish the Borrower with an invoice setting forth the amount of the accrued and unpaid Liquidity Fees and Program Fees payable to the Lenders in such Managing Agent's Lender Group. All payments of Interest and fees shall be made out of Collections, the proceeds of Loans or, if the Program Agent consents, such other funds available to the Borrower. SECTION 2.05. Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may, at its option, prepay on any Business Day all or any portion of any Loan upon prior written notice delivered to each Managing Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such payment. Each such notice shall be in the form attached as Exhibit J and shall (i) specify the aggregate amount of the prepayment to be made on the Loans and the Loans to which such prepayment is to be applied and (ii) specify the Business Day on which the Borrower will make such prepayment. Each such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount equal to $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof and shall be made ratably among the Lenders based on the aggregate Principal Balance of the Tranches held by each. At the request of any Managing Agent, each such prepayment of the Loans to the Lenders in such Managing Agent's Lender Group must be accompanied by a payment of all accrued and unpaid Interest on the amount prepaid and any other amounts (including amounts payable under Section 2.13) due from the Borrower hereunder in respect of such prepayment. Any such prepayment shall be made out of Collections or, with the consent of the Program Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) out of other funds of the Borrower. SECTION 2.06.

(a) If due to either: (i) the introduction of or any change (including, without limitation, any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements) in or in the interpretation by any Governmental Authority of any law or regulation (other than laws or regulations relating to taxes) after the date hereof or (ii) the compliance by any Lender or any Liquidity Provider with any directive or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) imposed after the date hereof, (1) there shall be an increase in the cost to such Lender or such Liquidity Provider of funding or maintaining any Tranche which accrues Interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the CP Rate hereunder or of extending a commitment in respect thereof, or (2) such Lender or such Liquidity Provider shall be required to make a payment calculated by reference to any Tranche which accrues Interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the CP Rate funded by it or Interest received by it, then the Borrower shall, from time to time, within thirty (30) days after demand by the related Managing Agent, pay such Managing Agent for the account of such Lender or such Liquidity Provider (as a third party beneficiary, in the case of any Affected Party other than one of the Lenders), that portion of such increased costs incurred, amounts not received or required payment made or to be made, which such Managing Agent reasonably determines is attributable to funding and maintaining, or extending a commitment to fund, any Tranche which accrues Interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the CP Rate hereunder or pursuant to any Asset Purchase Agreement or similar liquidity facility. (b) Each Managing Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Program Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle any Lender or related Liquidity Provider in its Lender Group to compensation pursuant to Section 2.11(a). Each Lender or Liquidity Provider will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender or Liquidity Provider, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. In determining the amount of such compensation, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The applicable Lender or Liquidity Provider (or such party's related Managing Agent) shall submit to the Borrower a certificate describing such increased costs incurred, amounts not received or receivable or required payment made or to be made, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Managing Agent to demand compensation pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall not constitute a waiver of such Managing Agent's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to 40
compensate any Lender or related Liquidity Provider pursuant to this Section for any increased capital unless such Managing Agent gives notice to the Borrower and the Program Agent to compensate such Lender or Liquidity Provider pursuant to this Section within 180 days after the date such Managing Agent knows an event has occurred pursuant to which such Lender or Liquidity Provider will seek such compensation. SECTION 2.12. Increased Capital.

(b) Each Managing Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Program Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle any Lender or Affected Party in its Lender Group to compensation pursuant to Section 2.12(a). Each Lender or Affected Party will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender or Affected Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. In determining the amount of such compensation, such Lender or Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The applicable Lender or Affected Party (or such party's related Managing Agent) shall submit to the Borrower a certificate describing such compensation, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (c) If less than all Lenders claim reimbursement from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12(a), each such Lender claiming reimbursement shall be obligated, at the request of the Borrower, to assign all of its rights and obligations hereunder to (i) the Lenders of its Lender Group hereunder that are willing to accept such rights and obligations or (ii) another financial institution nominated by the Borrower which is reasonably acceptable to the other Lenders in such Lender Group and is willing to participate in this Agreement through the Scheduled Termination Date in place of such Lender; provided, that (x) the Lender claiming reimbursement receives payment in full, pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, of an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Loans and all other accrued an unpaid Borrower 41
Obligations owing to it and (ii) the replacement Committed Lender proposed by the Borrower otherwise satisfies the requirements of Section 10.03(b). (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Managing Agent to demand compensation pursuant to Section 2.12(a) shall not constitute a waiver of such Managing Agent's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender or Affected Party in its Lender Group pursuant to this Section for any increased capital unless such Managing Agent gives notice to the Borrower and the Program Agent to compensate such Lender or Affected Party in its Lender Group pursuant to this Section within 180 days after the date such Managing Agent knows an event has occurred pursuant to which such Lender or Affected Party in its Lender Group will seek such compensation. SECTION 2.13. Funding Losses. In the event that any Liquidity Provider or any Lender shall incur any loss, expense or Liquidation Fees (including, without limitation, any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Liquidity Provider or Lender in order to fund or maintain any Loan or interest therein) as a result of (i) any reduction of the Principal Balance of any Tranche at any time or conversion of any Tranche to another Tranche prior to the originally scheduled last day of the converted Tranche, (ii) any transfer of any Loan or interest therein from a Conduit Lender to its Liquidity Providers, or (iii) any Loan not being made in accordance with a request therefor under Section 2.02, then, upon demand from the related Managing Agent to Borrower, Borrower shall pay to such Managing Agent for the account of such Liquidity Provider or Lender, the amount of such loss, expense or Liquidation Fees. Such written notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon Borrower. SECTION 2.14. Taxes. (a) Except to the extent required by applicable law, any and all payments and deposits required to be made hereunder or under any instrument delivered hereunder by the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (except for net income taxes that are imposed by the United States and franchise taxes and net income taxes that are imposed on such Affected Party by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Affected Party is organized or any political subdivision thereof). If the Borrower or the Servicer shall be required by law to make any such deduction, (i) the Borrower shall make an additional payment to such Affected Party, in an amount sufficient so that, after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14), such Affected Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower (or the Servicer, on its behalf) shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower (or the Servicer, on its behalf) shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any instrument delivered hereunder. (c) Each Affected Party which is not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof shall, on or prior to the date that such Affected Party becomes a party to or obtains rights under this Agreement, and prior to any payment being made by the Borrower to such Affected Party, deliver to the Borrower (i) two duly completed and executed copies of the IRS Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI (or any successor form) as applicable; and (ii) such other forms or certificates as may be required under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction (on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete), in order to permit the Borrower to make payments to, and deposit funds to or for the account of, such Affected Party hereunder and under the other Facility Documents without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any tax. Each such Affected Party shall submit to the Borrower (with copies to the Program Agent) two updated, completed, and duly executed versions of: (i) all forms referred to in the previous sentence upon the expiry of, or the occurrence of any event requiring a change in, the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the substitution of such form; and (ii) such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower. (d) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the benefit of any Affected Party pursuant to this Section as a result of a change of law or treaty occurring after such Affected Party first became a party to this Agreement, such Affected Party will, at the Borrower's request, change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if, in the sole judgment of such Affected Party, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Affected Party.

The Borrower hereby authorizes the filing of financing statements, and continuation statements and amendments thereto and assignments thereof, describing the collateral covered thereby as "all of debtor's personal property or assets" or words to that effect, notwithstanding that such wording may be broader in scope than the collateral described in this Section 2.15. This Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law. SECTION 2.16. Evidence of Debt. Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the outstanding principal balance of such Loans and the amount of Interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The entries made in such accounts of the Lenders shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SECTION 2.17. Interest on Cash Secured Advances. The Borrower shall pay interest to each Term-Out Lender on the unpaid principal amount of such Committed Lender's Cash Secured Advance from the date of such Cash Secured Advance until such principal amount shall be repaid in full, at a rate per annum equal at all times during each Tranche Period at the Interest Rate for such Tranche Period, payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Tranche Period and on the Termination Date for all Tranches related to such Cash Secured Advance. On each Interest Payment Date for each Tranche Period after the Cash Secured Advance Commencement Date the Program Agent shall disburse, on behalf of the Borrower, those dividends from or net investment gains with respect to, the Cash Collateral which shall then be available to be withdrawn from the Collateral Advance Account, and the Program Agent shall distribute such funds to the Term-Out Lenders, ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of their respective Cash Secured Advances, for application to the payment of unpaid accrued interest on the Cash Secured Advances. Any remaining unpaid accrued interest on the Cash Secured Advances shall be paid from the Collections of the Receivables pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 2.19(d). SECTION 2.18. Repayment of Cash Secured Advances. The Borrower shall repay to each Term-Out Lender the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Cash Secured Advance on the Termination Date for all Tranches related to such Cash Secured Advance.

(c) The grant of a security interest by the Borrower to the Program Agent for the ratable benefit of the Term-Out Lenders, pursuant to clause (b) above secures the payment of the Borrower's obligation to repay the Cash Secured Advances, and to pay interest thereon, pursuant to Sections 2.17 and 2.18, respectively. (d) On the Termination Date for all Tranches if the Term Period has occurred, the Program Agent, shall: (i) convert the Cash Collateral that does not constitute cash into cash proceeds and (ii) pay to each Term-Out Lender, ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of their respective Cash Secured Advances, for application, first, to the repayment of the outstanding principal amounts of the Cash Secured Advances and second, to the payment of unpaid accrued interest on the Cash Secured Advances (to the extent such funds are available therefor). SECTION 2.20. Establishment of Collateral Advance Account. (a) Subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Servicer, for the benefit of the Term-Out Lenders, upon the request of the Program Agent, shall establish and maintain or cause to be established and maintained in the name of the Program Agent, with an Eligible Institution, an account (such account being the "Collateral Advance Account" and such institution holding such account being the "Collateral Advance Account Bank"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Term-Out Lenders and entitled "Citicorp North America, Inc., as Program Agent -- Collateral Advance Account for the SWC Receivables Funding LLC Loan and Servicing Agreement."

At the time the Collateral Advance Account is established the Borrower shall cause the Collateral Advance Account Bank to agree in writing that it shall have no right of set-off or 45
banker's lien against, and no right to otherwise deduct from, any funds held in the Collateral Advance Account for any amount owed to it by any Person, provided that the Collateral Advance Account Bank may retain rights of set-off for scheduled fees and routine expenses. The tax identification number associated with the Collateral Advance Account shall be that of the Borrower.

Except as specified in Section 2.20(c), the Collateral Advance Account Bank will comply with Collateral Advance Account Directions and other directions concerning the Collateral Advance Account originated by, and only by, the Program Agent. (c) Funds on deposit in the Collateral Advance Account shall, at the written direction of the Servicer, be invested by the Program Agent, in Permitted Investments as instructed by the Servicer in writing (which may be a standing instruction). All such Permitted Investments shall be held in the Collateral Advance Account for the benefit of the Program Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Committed Lenders which have made Cash Secured Advances. Such funds shall be invested in Permitted Investments that will mature so that funds will be available in amounts sufficient for the Program Agent, to make each distribution as and when required under the terms of this Agreement. All interest and other investment earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) received on funds on deposit in the Collateral Advance Account, to the extent such investment income is not needed for the ratable benefit of the Term-Out Lenders under the terms of this Agreement, shall be added to the Collateral Advance Account.

ARTICLE IX THE AGENTS SECTION 9.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes its related Managing Agent and the Program Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to such Managing Agent or the Program Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Managing Agents, the Program Agent and the Lenders. The Borrower shall not have any rights as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise under any of the provisions hereof. In performing their functions and duties hereunder, the Managing Agents shall act solely as the agent for the respective Conduit Lenders and the Committed Lenders in the related Lender Group and do not assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or agency with or for the other Lenders, the Borrower, the Servicer, the Originator, any Affiliate thereof or any of their respective successors and assigns. SECTION 9.02. Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither the Program Agent nor any Managing Agent nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Managing Agent or the Program Agent under or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 9.03. Agents and Affiliates. Each Managing Agent and the Program Agent and their respective Affiliates may engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, Sherwin-Williams or any Obligor, any of their respective Affiliates and any Person who may do business with or own securities of Borrower, Sherwin-Williams or any Obligor or any of their respective Affiliates, all as if such Persons were not Managing Agents and/or Program Agent and without any duty to account therefor to any Lender. SECTION 9.04. Lender's Loan Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Program Agent, any Managing Agent, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own evaluation and decision to enter into this Agreement and, if it so determines, to make Loans hereunder. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Program Agent, any Managing Agent, any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. SECTION 9.05. Delegation of Duties. The Program Agent and each Managing Agent may each execute any of its duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.

Indemnification. Each Managing Agent severally agrees to indemnify the Program Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower, the Servicer, the Originator or Sherwin-Williams), ratably according to its related Lender Group Percentage, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Program Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Program Agent under this Agreement; provided, that (i) no Managing Agent shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting or arising from the Program Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) no Managing Agent shall be liable for any amount in respect of any compromise or settlement of any of the foregoing unless such compromise or settlement is approved by the Majority Managing Agents. Without limitation of the generality of the 76
foregoing, each Managing Agent agrees to reimburse the Program Agent, ratably according to its related Lender Group Percentage, promptly upon demand, for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Program Agent in connection with the administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement; provided, that no Managing Agent shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of the Program Agent in defending itself against any claim alleging the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Program Agent to the extent such gross negligence or willful misconduct is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision. SECTION 9.07. Successor Agents. The Program Agent and each Managing Agent may, upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Borrower, each Lender and each other party hereto, resign as Program Agent or Managing Agent, as applicable. If any such party shall resign as Program Agent or Managing Agent under this Agreement, then, in the case of the Program Agent, the Majority Committed Lenders and the Borrower, and in the case of any Managing Agent, its related Conduit Lenders, during such thirty-day period shall appoint a successor agent, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Program Agent or applicable Managing Agent and references herein to the Program Agent or such Managing Agent shall mean such successor agent, effective upon its appointment; and such former Program Agent's or Managing Agent's rights, powers and duties in such capacity shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Program Agent or Managing Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After any retiring Program Agent's or Managing Agent's resignation hereunder as such agent, the provisions of Article VIII, this Article IX and Section 10.09 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Program Agent or a Managing Agent under this Agreement. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 10.01. Amendments, Etc. (a) No waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by the Borrower or the Servicer therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Program Agent and the Managing Agents and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. (b) No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each of the Borrower, the Servicer, the Program Agent, the Managing Agents and the Majority Committed Lenders, provided, however, that, without the written consent of all the Committed Lenders, no such amendment shall (i) extend the Termination Date, (ii) extend the date of any payment or deposit of Collections by the Borrower or by the Servicer or the time of payment of Interest, (iii) release the security interest in or transfer all or any material portion of the Collateral, (iv) change the outstanding principal amount of any of the Loans made by any Committed Lender hereunder other than as provided herein, (v) change the amount of any Lender Group Limit other than as provided herein or increase the 77

SECTION 10.02. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall, unless otherwise stated herein, be in writing (including communication by facsimile copy) and shall be personally delivered or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, or by courier or by facsimile, to each party hereto, at its address set forth on Schedule II hereof or at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto.

SECTION 10.03. Assignability. (a) Any Conduit Lender may, (i) with notice to the Borrower and the Servicer, and with the consent of the Managing Agent for the Lender Group of which it is a member, assign at any time all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and interests herein to (A) any other Lender, (B) any commercial paper conduit managed by such Conduit Lender's sponsor or administrator bank if the Promissory Notes of such commercial paper conduit have short-term ratings from S&P and Moody's that are equivalent to or higher than the short-term ratings by S&P and Moody's of the Promissory Notes of such Conduit Lender, (C) any Affiliate of such Conduit Lender's sponsor bank or (D) any Liquidity Provider with respect to such Conduit Lender and (ii) with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and the Managing Agent for the Lender Group of which it is a member, assign at any time all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and interests herein to any other Person not listed in clause (i) above. Any Managing Agent may, with notice to the Borrower and the Servicer, and with the consent of the Lenders in its Lender Group, assign at any time all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and interests herein to any Affiliate of such Managing Agent. (b) Any Committed Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and with the consent of the Managing Agent for the Lender Group of which it is a member, assign at any time all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and interests herein to any Person; provided, however, that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required in connection with any assignment by a Committed Lender (i) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Termination or (ii) to any other Lender. 78
(c) With respect to any assignment hereunder (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) the amount being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $10,000,000, and (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined below), an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $2,500. (d) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent that rights and obligations under this Agreement have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder and (y) the assigning Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish such rights and be released from such obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).At all times during which any Loan is outstanding, the Program Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.02 of this Agreement (or such other address of the Program Agent notified by the Program Agent to the other parties hereto) a register as provided herein (the "Register"). The Aggregate Principal Balance and any interests therein, and any Assignments and Acceptances of the Aggregate Principal Balance or any interest therein delivered to and accepted by the Program Agent, shall be registered in the Register, and the Register shall serve as a record of ownership that identifies the owner of the Aggregate Principal Balances and any interest therein. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no transfer of the Aggregate Principal Balances or any interest therein shall be effective unless and until such transfer has been recorded in the Register. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Servicer, the Program Agent, the Managing Agents and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement. This Section 10.03(d) shall be construed so that the Aggregate Principal Balance and any interest therein is maintained at all times in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c) of the IRC, solely for the purposes of this Section 10.03, the Program Agent will act as an agent of the Borrower. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Managing Agent at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance, the Program Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been duly completed, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. 79
(f) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including the outstanding Loan); provided that following the sale of a participation under this Agreement (i) the obligations of such Lender shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Program Agent, the Servicer and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such Lender sells such a participation shall provide that the Participant shall not have any right to direct the enforcement of this Agreement or the other Facility Documents or to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Facility Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (i) reduces the amount of principal or Interest that is payable on account of any Loan or delays any scheduled date for payment thereof or (ii) reduces any fees payable by the Borrower to the Program Agent (to the extent relating to payments to the Participant) or delays any scheduled date for payment of such fees. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any Lender's source of funds may derive in part from its Participants. Accordingly, references in Sections 2.12 or 2.14 and the other terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Facility Documents to determinations, reserve and capital adequacy requirements, expenses, increased costs, reduced receipts and the like as they pertain to the Lenders shall be deemed also to include those of its Participants; provided, however, that in no event shall the Borrower be liable to any Participant under Sections 2.12 or 2.14 for an amount in excess of that which would be payable to the applicable Lender under such sections. (g) Neither the Borrower nor the Servicer may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Program Agent and the Majority Managing Agents. (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights (including, without limitation, rights to payment of the principal balance of the Loans and Interest with respect thereto) hereunder to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank, without notice to or consent of the Borrower or the Program Agent; provided, that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or grantee for such Lender as a party hereto. SECTION 10.04. Additional Lender Groups. Upon the Borrower's request, an additional Lender Group may be added to this Agreement at any time by the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement by the members of such proposed additional Lender Group, the Borrower, the Servicer, Sherwin-Williams, the Program Agent and each of the Managing Agents, which execution and delivery shall not be unreasonably refused by such parties. Upon the effective date of such Joinder Agreement, (i) each Person specified therein as a "Conduit Lender" shall become a party hereto as a Conduit Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Conduit Lender hereunder, (ii) each Person specified therein as a "Committed Lender" shall become a party hereto as a Committed Lender, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Committed Lender hereunder, (iii) each Person specified therein as a 80
"Managing Agent" shall become a party hereto as a Managing Agent, entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Managing Agent hereunder and (iv) the Facility Limit shall be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate Commitments of the Committed Lenders party to such Joinder Agreement. On or prior to the effective date of such Joinder Agreement, the Borrower and the new Managing Agent shall enter into a fee letter for purposes of setting forth the fees payable to the members of such Lender Group in connection with this Agreement, which fee letter shall be considered a "Fee Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement. SECTION 10.05. Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal court sitting in New York City in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each party hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent they may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. (b) Each of the Borrower and the Servicer consents to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to it at its address specified in Section 10.02. Nothing in this Section 10.05 shall affect the right of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. SECTION 10.06. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER FACILITY DOCUMENT. SECTION 10.07. Right of Setoff. Each Lender (including a Lender which has made Cash Secured Advances) is hereby authorized (in addition to any other rights it may have) at any time after the occurrence of the Termination Date due to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, or at any time that any Borrower Obligation hereunder is due and payable, to set off, appropriate and apply (without presentment, demand, protest or other notice which are hereby expressly waived) any deposits and any other indebtedness held or owing by such Lender to, or for the account of, the Borrower against the amount of the Borrower Obligations owing by the Borrower to such Person. Each Lender is hereby authorized (in addition to any other rights it may have) at any time after the occurrence of the Termination Date due to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, or at any time that any payment obligation of the Servicer hereunder is due and payable, to set off, appropriate and apply (without presentment, demand, protest or other notice which are hereby expressly waived) any deposits and any other indebtedness held or owing by such Lender to, or for the account of, the Servicer against the amount of such obligations owing by the Servicer to such Person. 81
SECTION 10.08. Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it with respect to any Borrower Obligations or obligation of the Servicer in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender entitled to receive a ratable share of such amount, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase for cash without recourse or warranty a portion of such Borrower Obligations or Servicer obligation held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of such Borrower Obligations or Servicer obligations, as applicable; provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. SECTION 10.09. Limitation of Liability. (a) No claim may be made by any Transaction Party or any other party hereto against any other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Facility Document, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection herewith or therewith; and each party hereto hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the obligations of the Conduit Lenders under this Agreement are solely the corporate obligations of each such Conduit Lender and shall be payable only at such time as funds are actually received by, or are available to, such Conduit Lender in excess of funds necessary to pay in full all outstanding Promissory Notes issued by such Conduit Lender and, to the extent funds are not available to pay such obligations, the claims relating thereto shall not constitute a claim against such Conduit Lender. Each party hereto agrees that the payment of any claim (as defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) of any such party shall be subordinated to the payment in full of all Promissory Notes. (c) No recourse under any obligation, covenant or agreement of any Conduit Lender contained in this Agreement shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, member, manager, employee or agent of such Conduit Lender or any of its Affiliates (solely by virtue of such capacity) by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that this Agreement is solely a corporate obligation of such Conduit Lender, and that no personal liability whatever shall attach to or be incurred by any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, member, manager, employee or agent of any Conduit Lender or any of its Affiliates (solely by virtue of such capacity) or any of them under or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements of such Conduit Lender contained in this Agreement, or implied therefrom, and that any and all personal liability for breaches by any Conduit Lender of any of such obligations, covenants or agreements, either at common law or at equity, or by statute, rule or regulation, of every such incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, member, manager, employee or agent is hereby expressly waived as a condition of and in consideration for the execution of this Agreement; provided that the foregoing shall not relieve any such 82
