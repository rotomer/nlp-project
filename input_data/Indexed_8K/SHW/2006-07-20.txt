Exercise and Payment of Option
     5. A "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if:
Change of Control.
     (A) Any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, hereinafter the "Exchange Act") who or that, together with all "Affiliates" and "Associates" (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2, as in effect on April 23, 1997, of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act) of such person, is the Beneficial Owner (as defined below) of ten percent (10%) or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, except:
     (i) the Company;
     (ii) any of the Company's subsidiaries in which a majority of the voting power of the equity securities or equity interests of such subsidiary is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company;
     (iii) any employee benefit or stock ownership plan of the Company or any trustee or fiduciary with respect to such a plan acting in such capacity; or
     (iv) any such person who has reported or may, pursuant to Rule 13d-l(b)(1) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, report such ownership (but only as long as such person is the Beneficial Owner of less than fifteen percent (15%) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding) on Schedule 13G (or any comparable or successor report) under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) no person shall become the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) solely as the result of an acquisition of Common Stock by the Company that, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such person to ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; provided, however, that if a person becomes the Beneficial
 
Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock solely by reason of purchases of Common Stock by the Company and shall, after such purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock which has the effect of increasing such person's percentage ownership of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock by any means whatsoever, then such person shall be deemed to have triggered a Change of Control; and (b) if the Board determines that a person who would otherwise be the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock has become such inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (1) such person was unaware that it Beneficially Owned ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock or (2) such person was aware of the extent of such beneficial ownership but such person acquired beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock without the intention to change or influence the control of the Company) and such person divests itself as promptly as practicable of a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock so that such person would no longer be the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above), then such person shall not be deemed to be, or have been, the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock, and no Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred.
     (B) During any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new director (other than a director initially elected or nominated as a director as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to directors or any other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies by or on behalf of such director) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof.
     (C) There shall be consummated any consolidation, merger or other combination of the Company with any other person or entity other than:
     (i) a consolidation, merger or other combination which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty-one percent (51%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such consolidation, merger or other combination; or
     (ii) a consolidation, merger or other combination effected to implement a recapitalization and/or reorganization of the Company (or similar transaction), or any other consolidation, merger or other combination of the Company, which results in no person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such person, becoming the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified
 
in clause (A)(iv) above) of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities.
     (D) There shall be consummated any sale, lease, assignment, exchange, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the assets or earning power of the Company (including, without limitation, any such sale, lease, assignment, exchange, transfer or other disposition effected to implement a recapitalization and/or reorganization of the Company (or similar transaction)) which results in any person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such person, owning a proportionate share of such assets or earning power greater than the proportionate share of the voting power of the Company that such person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such person, owned immediately prior to any such sale, lease, assignment, exchange, transfer or other disposition.
     (E) The shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company.
     For purposes of this Section 5, a person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of and shall be deemed to "beneficially own" any securities:
     (x) which such person or any of such person's Affiliates or Associates is considered to be a "beneficial owner" under Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, as in effect on April 23, 1997;
     (y) which such person or any of such person's Affiliates or Associates, directly or indirectly, has or shares the right to acquire, hold, vote (except pursuant to a revocable proxy as described in the proviso to this definition) or dispose of such securities (whether any such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing), or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, rights, warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed to be the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf of such person or any of such person's Affiliates or Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for purchase or exchange; or
     (z) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other person (or any Affiliate or Associate of such other person) with which such person (or any of such person's Affiliates or Associates) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing), with respect to acquiring, holding, voting (except as described in the proviso to this definition) or disposing of any securities of the Company;
provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, nor to beneficially own, any security if such person has the right to vote such security pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or understanding which (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy given to such person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D (or any comparable or successor report) under the Exchange
 
Act; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 8.05 shall cause a person engaged in business as an underwriter or securities to be the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any securities acquired through such person's participation in good faith in a firm commitment underwriting until the expiration of forty (40) days after the date of such acquisition or such later date as the Board may determine in any specific case.
     6. . The option is not transferable by you otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during your lifetime, only by you or, in the case of your legal incapacity, only by your guardian or legal representative. These Additional Terms and Conditions bind you and your guardians, legal representatives and heirs.

     8. . If the Company shall be required to withhold any federal, state, local or foreign tax in connection with exercise of the option, it shall be a condition to such exercise that you pay or make provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of all such taxes.
Withholding Taxes
     9. . The option award is a voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards. The option award and any related payments made to you will not be considered salary or other compensation for purposes of any severance pay or similar allowance, except as otherwise required by law. Nothing contained herein will not confer upon you any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate your employment or other service at any time.
No Right to Future Awards or Employment
     10. . If any provision of these Additional Terms and Conditions or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, the remainder of these Additional Terms and Conditions and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable, valid and legal.
Severability
     11. These Additional Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed with the internal substantive laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to any principle of law that would result in the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.

     (iii) In the event Grantee's employment terminates as a result of normal retirement age as defined under the applicable retirement plan of the Company or a Subsidiary, all rights of Grantee under this grant shall continue as if Grantee had continued employment in a Participating Position. The determination of the percentage of the number of Restricted Shares that will vest will be made as if Grantee had remained employed in a Participating Position throughout the Restriction Period.
     (iv) In the event Grantee's employment terminates as a result of early retirement (retirement on or after the earliest voluntary retirement age but before normal retirement age as provided for in the applicable retirement plan of the Company or a Subsidiary or retirement at an earlier age with the consent of the Board), the Board shall have the right to cancel Grantee's rights hereunder, continue Grantee's rights hereunder in full, or prorate the number of Restricted Shares granted hereunder for the portion of the Restriction Period completed as of the date of such retirement or as the Board may otherwise deem appropriate.

     (C) In the event that Grantee knowingly or willfully engages in misconduct during the Restriction Period, which is materially harmful to the interests of the Company or a Subsidiary as determined by the Board, all rights of Grantee in the Restricted Shares shall terminate.
     4. Within a reasonable time following the Date of Grant, the Company shall instruct its transfer agent to establish a book entry account representing the Restricted Shares in Grantee's name effective as of the Date of Grant, provided that the Company shall retain control over the account until the Restricted Shares have vested. On the Date of Grant, ownership of the Restricted Shares shall immediately transfer to Grantee and, except for the substantial risk of forfeiture and the restrictions on transfer expressly set forth herein, Grantee shall be entitled to all voting, dividend, distribution and other ownership rights as may apply to the Common Stock generally. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any stock dividends or other in-kind dividends or distributions shall be held by the Company until the related Restricted Shares have become vested in accordance with this grant and shall remain subject to the forfeiture provisions applicable to the Restricted Shares to which such dividends or distributions relate.

     5. A "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if:
Change of Control.
     (A) Any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, hereinafter the "Exchange Act") who or that, together with all "Affiliates" and "Associates" (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2, as in effect on April 23, 1997, of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act) of such person, is the Beneficial Owner (as defined below) of ten percent (10%) or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, except:

     (ii) any of the Company's subsidiaries in which a majority of the voting power of the equity securities or equity interests of such subsidiary is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company;
     (iii) any employee benefit or stock ownership plan of the Company or any trustee or fiduciary with respect to such a plan acting in such capacity; or
     (iv) any such person who has reported or may, pursuant to Rule 13d-l(b)(1) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, report such ownership (but only as long as such person is the Beneficial Owner of less than fifteen percent (15%) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding) on Schedule 13G (or any comparable or successor report) under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) no person shall become the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) solely as the result of an acquisition of Common Stock by the Company that, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such person to ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; provided, however, that if a person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
 
ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock solely by reason of purchases of Common Stock by the Company and shall, after such purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock which has the effect of increasing such person's percentage ownership of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock by any means whatsoever, then such person shall be deemed to have triggered a Change of Control; and (b) if the Board determines that a person who would otherwise be the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock has become such inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (1) such person was unaware that it Beneficially Owned ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock or (2) such person was aware of the extent of such beneficial ownership but such person acquired beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock without the intention to change or influence the control of the Company) and such person divests itself as promptly as practicable of a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock so that such person would no longer be the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above), then such person shall not be deemed to be, or have been, the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (iv) above) of the shares of Common Stock, and no Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred.
     (B) During any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new director (other than a director initially elected or nominated as a director as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to directors or any other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies by or on behalf of such director) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof.
     (C) There shall be consummated any consolidation, merger or other combination of the Company with any other person or entity other than:
     (i) a consolidation, merger or other combination which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty-one percent (51%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such consolidation, merger or other combination; or
     (ii) a consolidation, merger or other combination effected to implement a recapitalization and/or reorganization of the Company (or similar transaction), or any other consolidation, merger or other combination of the Company, which results in no person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such person, becoming the Beneficial Owner of ten percent (10%) or more (fifteen percent (15%) or more in the case of any person identified in clause (A)(iv) above) of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities.
 
     (D) There shall be consummated any sale, lease, assignment, exchange, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of fifty percent (50%) or more of the assets or earning power of the Company (including, without limitation, any such sale, lease, assignment, exchange, transfer or other disposition effected to implement a recapitalization and/or reorganization of the Company (or similar transaction)) which results in any person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such person, owning a proportionate share of such assets or earning power greater than the proportionate share of the voting power of the Company that such person, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such person, owned immediately prior to any such sale, lease, assignment, exchange, transfer or other disposition.
     (E) The shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company.
     For purposes of this Section 5, a person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of and shall be deemed to "beneficially own" any securities:
     (x) which such person or any of such person's Affiliates or Associates is considered to be a "beneficial owner" under Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act, as in effect on April 23, 1997;

     (z) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other person (or any Affiliate or Associate of such other person) with which such person (or any of such person's Affiliates or Associates) has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing), with respect to acquiring, holding, voting (except as described in the proviso to this definition) or disposing of any securities of the Company;
provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, nor to beneficially own, any security if such person has the right to vote such security pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or understanding which (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy given to such person in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D (or any comparable or successor report) under the Exchange Act; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 8.05 shall cause a person engaged in business as an underwriter or securities to be the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially own, any securities acquired through such person's participation in good faith in a firm commitment underwriting until the expiration of forty (40) days after the date of such acquisition or such later
 
date as the Board may determine in any specific case.
     6. . During the Restriction Period, Grantee shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or dispose of the Restricted Shares.

Withholding Taxes
     8. . The grant is a voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards.

Nothing contained herein will not confer upon Grantee any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate Grantee's employment or other service at any time.
No Right to Future Awards or Employment
     9. . If any provision of this grant or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, the remainder of this grant and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable, valid and legal.

EXHIBIT 99
     CLEVELAND, OHIO, July 20, 2006  The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) announced its financial results for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2006. Compared to the same periods in 2005, consolidated net sales increased $164.6 million, or 8.4%, to $2.13 billion in the quarter and $394.6 million, or 11.3%, to $3.90 billion in the first six months due primarily to continuing strong domestic and international paint sales. Consolidated net income increased $31.4 million, or 20.5%, to $184.6 million in the quarter and $61.7 million, or 26.1%, to $298.3 million in the first six months. As a percent to net sales, consolidated net income improved to 8.7% from 7.8% in the quarter and to 7.7% from 6.8% in the first six months due primarily to improved operations. Diluted net income per common share increased 23.1% in the quarter to $1.33 per share from $1.08 per share in 2005 and 30.1% in the first six months to $2.16 per share from $1.66 per share last year.
     Effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its reportable operating segments based on changes in its management structure to the following segments: Paint Stores Group, Consumer Group and Global Group. Historical business segment information has been updated to reflect this change in reportable operating segments.
     Net sales in the Paint Stores Group Segment increased $140.5 million, or 11.8%, to $1.33 billion in the quarter and $320.2 million, or 15.5%, to $2.38 billion for the first six months due primarily to continuing strong domestic architectural paint sales to contractor and do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and improved industrial maintenance product sales. Net sales from stores open for more than twelve calendar months increased 9.6% in the quarter and 13.4% in the first six months. Paint Stores Group Segment operating profit increased $34.5 million, or 18.9%, to $217.2 million in the quarter and $72.8 million, or 28.3%, to $330.5 million in the first six months. Operating profit as a percent to net sales increased to 16.3% from 15.4% in the quarter and to 13.9% from 12.5% in the first six months due primarily to increased paint sales volume and effective SG&A expense control.
     Net sales of the Consumer Group Segment in the quarter decreased $13.6 million, or 3.3%, to $400.9 million and in the first six months decreased $10.0 million, or 1.4%, to $730.8 million. These sales decreases were due to the elimination of a portion of a paint program with a large retail customer partially offset by increased paint sales volume and selling price increases. Operating profit of this Segment increased $11.3 million, or 17.3%, to $76.3 million in the quarter and $15.5 million, or 13.2%, to $133.0 million in the first six months. As a percent to net sales, Consumer Group Segment operating profit increased to 19.0% from
 
15.7% in the quarter and 18.2% from 15.9% in the first six months due to selling price increases, tight spending control and better factory utilization resulting from higher volume shipments to the Paint Stores Group Segment that offset continuing raw material cost increases.
     The Global Group Segment's net sales in the quarter increased $37.7 million, or 10.4%, to $398.8 million and in the first six months increased $84.2 million, or 12.1%, to $779.4 million when stated in U.S. dollars. This Segment's net sales stated in local currency increased by 7.8% in the quarter and by 8.6% in the first six months due primarily to architectural paint selling price increases and volume gains in Mexico and South America and improved automotive and product finishes sales. Operating profit of this Segment improved $8.6 million, or 33.7%, to $34.0 million in the quarter and $20.3 million, or 43.8%, to $66.5 million in the first six months. Operating profit as a percent to net sales increased to 8.5% from 7.1% in the quarter and to 8.5% from 6.7% in the first six months. This Segment's operating profit was favorably impacted by increased sales, improved operating efficiencies related to additional manufacturing volume and expense control. There was no significant impact on operating profit in the quarter due to currency exchange fluctuations.
     Commenting on the second quarter results, Christopher M. Connor, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased that all our operating segments continue to achieve operating profit growth on a year-over-year basis. We are encouraged by the ongoing positive sales results generated by the Paint Stores Group and Global Group Segments. Integration of the Duron and Paint Sundry Brands acquisitions continues to go well, and those businesses are exceeding our expectations of both net sales and operating profit. Our management teams will continue to emphasize tight control over selling, general and administrative expenses as another means to improve operating profit.
     "We expect to achieve continued growth in net operating cash flow in part by maintaining control over working capital. Our net total of accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, as a percent of net sales, was 13.9% at the end of the second quarter versus 16.6% at the same time last year. We will continue to opportunistically acquire our stock through open market purchases. During the quarter, we acquired 850,000 shares of our common stock and at the end of the quarter had remaining authorization to purchase 17,171,000 shares.
     "During the third quarter of 2006, we anticipate achieving an increase in consolidated net sales between 6% and 9% over last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the third quarter to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.28 per share compared to $1.07 per share last year. For the full year 2006, we anticipate that the percentage increase in our consolidated net sales will be in the high-single to low-double digits over 2005. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2006 will be in the range of $4.00 to $4.10 per share, including an estimated $.08 per share charge for the additional expense relating to stock options, compared to $3.28 per share earned in 2005."
