EXHIBIT 99
     CLEVELAND, OHIO, October 19, 2006  The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) announced its financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006. Compared to the same periods in 2005, consolidated net sales increased $140.0 million, or 7.1%, to $2.1 billion in the quarter and $534.6 million, or 9.8%, to $6.0 billion in nine months due primarily to strong paint sales by the Global Group and by stores open for more than twelve calendar months in the Paint Stores Group. Consolidated net income increased $27.5 million, or 18.1%, to $179.1 million in the quarter and $89.3 million, or 23.0%, to $477.4 million in nine months. As a percent to net sales, consolidated net income improved to 8.5% from 7.7% in the quarter and to 7.9% from 7.1% in nine months due primarily to improved profitability of operations. Diluted net income per common share increased 21.5% in the quarter to $1.30 per share from $1.07 per share in 2005 and 26.7% in nine months to $3.46 per share from $2.73 per share last year.
     Effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its reportable operating segments based on changes in its management structure to the following segments: Paint Stores Group, Consumer Group and Global Group. Historical business segment information has been updated to reflect this change in reportable operating segments.
     Net sales in the Paint Stores Group increased $116.7 million, or 9.5%, to $1.3 billion in the quarter and $436.9 million, or 13.3%, to $3.7 billion in nine months due primarily to strong domestic architectural paint sales to contractors in the first half of 2006 that softened slightly in the third quarter and improved industrial maintenance product sales. Net sales from stores open for more than twelve calendar months increased 7.2% in the quarter and 11.1% in nine months. Paint Stores Group segment profit increased $48.3 million, or 27.1%, to $226.7 million in the quarter and $121.1 million, or 27.8%, to $557.2 million in nine months. Paint Stores Group segment profit as a percent to net sales increased to 16.8% from 14.5% in the quarter and to 14.9% from 13.2% in nine months due primarily to increased paint sales volume, effective SG&A expense control, and increased selling prices on paint and all non-paint categories of products sold.
     Net sales of the Consumer Group decreased $5.3 million, or 1.5%, to $355.0 million in the quarter and $15.3 million, or 1.4%, to $1.09 billion in nine months. The sales declines were due primarily to lower sales to certain major retail customers of this Group as they continue to drive up inventory turns, sluggish Do-It-Yourself (DIY) sales at other customers and the elimination of a portion of a paint program with a large retail customer that most significantly impacted the first half of 2006.
 
Consumer Group segment profit increased $6.2 million, or 11.4%, to $60.3 million in the quarter and $21.7 million, or 12.6%, to $193.3 million in nine months. As a percent to net sales, this Group's segment profit increased to 17.0% from 15.0% in the quarter and to 17.8% from 15.6% in nine months due to selling price increases, tight spending control and better factory utilization resulting from higher volume shipments to the Paint Stores Group that offset continuing selected raw material cost increases.
     Net sales of the Global Group increased $28.5 million, or 7.4%, to $412.0 million in the quarter and $112.7 million, or 10.4%, to $1.2 billion in nine months when stated in U.S. dollars. This Group's net sales stated in local currency increased 5.6% in the quarter and 7.5% in nine months due primarily to selling price increases and volume gains in all its operations worldwide. The Global Group's segment profit improved $19.2 million, or 81.5%, to $42.7 million in the quarter and $39.4 million, or 56.5%, to $109.2 million in nine months. Global Group's segment profit as a percent to net sales increased to 10.4% from 6.1% in the quarter and to 9.2% from 6.5% in nine months. This Group's segment profit was favorably impacted by increased sales, improved operating efficiencies related to additional manufacturing volume and expense control. There was no significant impact on Global Group segment profit in the quarter due to currency exchange fluctuations. This Group's third quarter segment profit last year was negatively impacted by a loss of $7.9 million resulting from the disposition of its majority interest in an automotive joint venture in China.
     Commenting on the third quarter and nine months results, Christopher M. Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased that the Paint Stores Group continues to achieve improved net sales in spite of some recent slowing in the new-home market and softness in D-I-Y customer demand. We are also pleased with the Paint Stores Group's increased productivity that has helped increase profitability while absorbing costs associated with opening 69 net new stores during the first nine months of this year  an increase of 25% over the same period in 2005.
     "We are encouraged that our Consumer Group management continues to drive efficiencies that have helped to partially offset that Group's sales reductions while they continue to adjust to their customers' inventory management practices. Although the Consumer Group's gross margins continue to feel the pressure of certain persistent raw material cost increases, our outlook is optimistic that this Group will continue to manage through such cost increases and maintain its profitability.
     "We are pleased with the continued strong improvements in sales and operational performance in every one of the businesses and geographic areas of our Global Group. We are encouraged by the increasing market penetration being achieved by our international businesses and the continued growth of our domestic automotive and product finishes sales.
     "In the fourth quarter of 2006, we anticipate achieving an increase in consolidated net sales between 5% and 7% over last year's fourth quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $.63 to $.68 per share compared to $.54 per share last year. For the full year 2006, we anticipate an increase in our annual consolidated net sales between 8% and 9% over the full year 2005. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for the full year 2006 will be in the range of $4.10 to $4.15 per share, including an estimated $.08 per share charge for additional expense relating to stock options, compared to $3.28 per share earned in 2005."
