(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Company to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Company, the interest rate applicable to such Loan.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.07. Termination of Commitments; Reduction of Commitments.

(a) The Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section.

The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.12. Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that because of a change in circumstances affecting the eurodollar market generally the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent
 
Table of Contents
notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or the Letter of Credit or participations therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank in an amount that such Lender or the Issuing Bank deems to be material of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost of such Lender or the Issuing Bank in an amount that such Lender or the Issuing Bank deems to be material of participating in, issuing or maintaining the Letter of Credit or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), other than any increase in costs resulting from (A) Excluded Taxes or (B) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to which Section 2.15 is applicable, then the Company will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank in accordance with Section 2.16 such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender or the Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank in accordance with Section 2.16 such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

provided
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section if it is not at the time the general policy or practice of such Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation in similar circumstances in similar credit agreements.
SECTION 2.14. Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the Company shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for dollar deposits from other banks in the eurodollar market at the commencement of such period.

SECTION 2.15. Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Company hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Company shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to indemnify the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank for any interest, penalties or expenses described above arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in taking any action it was required by applicable law to take including, but not limited to, filing any tax return or report in a timely manner.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.16. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Company shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursement of LC Disbursements or of any amounts under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the date when due in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to be credited to the Administrative Agent's Account. All payments made by the Company to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank as provided herein or in any Note shall be deemed received by the Lenders or the Issuing Bank for all purposes as between the Lenders or the Issuing Bank and the Company. With respect to payments to be made to the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or Facility Fees to the Issuing Bank. Promptly after any such payment, the Isuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) will cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or Facility Fees (other than amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.04(f), 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or 9.03(a), (b) or (c)) (according to the Lenders' respective Commitments) to the Lenders for the account of their respective lending offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent then shall cause like funds to be distributed to such Lender for the account of its applicable lending office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms
s
 
Table of Contents
of this Agreement or any Note. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this subsection shall apply). The Company consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank that the Company will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Administrative Agent, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the
 
Table of Contents
Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
(e) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d), 2.05(b) or 2.16(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender or the Issuing Bank's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.17. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, (ii) the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.15, (iii) if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) if in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or consent, the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained but the consent of a Lender the consent of which is required shall not have been obtained, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.08, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. Any Lender exercising any of its rights pursuant to this Section shall provide notice of the same to the Company promptly after exercising the same; provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, Citibank shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section if it is not at the time the general policy or practice of Citibank to demand compensation in similar circumstances in similar agreements.
6. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Applicant hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if Applicant shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) Citibank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Applicant shall make such deductions and (iii) Applicant shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.
provided
(b) In addition, Applicant shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(f) If Citibank determines that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Applicant or with respect to which the Applicant has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 6, it shall pay over such refund to the Applicant (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Applicant under this Section 6 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Citibank and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Applicant, upon the request of Citibank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Applicant (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to Citibank in the event Citibank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require Citibank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Applicant or any other Person.
7.

relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Affiliates or from a breach of this Agreement by such Indemnitee.
provided
(c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each party hereto shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, any Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
