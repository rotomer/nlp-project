Indemnification of the Underwriters.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the statements concerning the underwriters in the third paragraph, the third and fourth sentences of the seventh paragraph and the eighth paragraph under the heading "Underwriting" in Prospectus and, with respect to each Underwriter, such Underwriter's name as it appears on the cover.
Indemnification of the Company.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, separate from the counsel retained by the Indemnifying Person for all Indemnified Persons, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person or other Indemnified Persons; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that, subject to the foregoing sentence, the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with
Notice and Procedures.
provided
provided
further
 
any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.

Termination
10. (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any
Defaulting Underwriter.
 
Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

provided
4.        At any time and from time to time, the Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal thereon (exclusive of interest accrued and unpaid to, but not including, the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption.
For purposes of determining the redemption price, the following definitions shall apply:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by a Quotation Agent as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (B) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all such quotations for such redemption date.
"Primary Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York.
 
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company; , , that if such Reference Treasury Dealer ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
provided
however
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means any of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers, and a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and, in each case, their respective successors plus one other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company; , , that if any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
provided
however
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, and such Notes are in the form of Global Securities held by the Depositary, the Depositary will select the interests in the Notes to be redeemed in accordance with its operational arrangements. If the Notes are not in the form of Global Securities held by the Depositary, the Trustee shall select the Notes or portions thereof (in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) to be redeemed by lot or by such other method as the Trustee considers fair and appropriate.
Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in Section 3.03 of the Indenture except that any notice of redemption need not specify the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the calculation of the redemption price. The Company shall calculate the redemption price and promptly notify the Trustee thereof.
5.        If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes as described above by giving notice of such redemption to the Holders thereof, the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased up to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the option of the
 
Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to Holders of the Notes describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or, if the notice is mailed prior to the Change of Control, no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date on which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurs (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent (or, if the Company is acting as the Company's own paying agent, segregate and hold in trust) an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as possible after the date of purchase.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the time and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Company shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 5, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached the Company's obligations under this Section 5 by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of this Section 5, the following terms shall be applicable:
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:

(2)        the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the assets of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more "persons" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries);
(3)        the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) or any such person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in either case, pursuant to a transaction in which any of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company or the Voting Stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than pursuant to a transaction in which shares of the Voting Stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction;
(4)        the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or
(5)        the first day on which a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Company are not Continuing Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (i) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company and (ii) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to that transaction.
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both (1) a Change of Control and (2) a Rating Event.
"Continuing Director" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the board of directors of the Company who (1) was a member of such board of directors on the date the Notes were issued, (2) was nominated for election to such board of directors with the approval of a committee of the board of directors consisting of a majority of independent continuing directors or (3) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
 
"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, or, if applicable, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any substitute rating agency selected by the Company.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into supplemental indentures to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding of each series to be affected thereby on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of such series. In addition, the Indenture permits the
 
Company and the Trustee to enter into supplemental indentures to the Indenture, without the consent of Holders, for certain purposes, including to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained in the Indenture and to make changes that do not adversely affect the rights of any Holder. The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding of each series on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults and their consequences with respect to such series under the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security or such other Notes.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Debt Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar or at the offices of any transfer agent designated by the Company for such purpose. Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange or payment shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes (subject to Section 2.A hereof), whether or not such Security is overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

11.        This Security is a Global Security. Accordingly, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to any nominee of
 
such successor Depositary. Ownership of beneficial interests in this Security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable Depositary or its nominee (with respect to interest of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants).
So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of this Security, the Depositary or that nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole legal owner or Holder of the Notes represented by this Security for all purposes of the Notes and the Indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in this Security (1) will not be entitled to have the Notes represented by this Security registered in their names, (2) will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated securities and (3) will not be considered the owners or Holders of the Notes represented by that beneficial interest under the Indenture for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee. Accordingly, each Person owning a beneficial interest in this Security must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if that Person is not a Depositary participant or indirect participant, on the procedures of the participant through which that Person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder of Notes under the Indenture or this Security.
Except as provided in this paragraph, beneficial interests in this Security may not be exchanged for certificated securities. In addition to the provisions set forth in Sections 2.15(c)(i) and (ii) of the Indenture, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, the Depositary will exchange this Global Security for certificated Notes that it will distribute to its participants.
Payments with respect to the principal of and interest on this Security will be payable by the Trustee to or at the direction of the Depositary or its nominee in its capacity as the registered Holder of this Security under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Company and the Trustee may treat the persons in whose names this Security are registered as the owners hereof for the purpose of receiving payment thereon (except as provided in Section 2.A hereof) and for any and all other purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Registrar, the paying agent or any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for (a) any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in this Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, (b) the payments to the beneficial owners of this Security of amounts paid to the Depositary or its nominee or (c) any other matter relating to the actions or practices of the Depositary, its nominee or any of its direct or indirect participants.
12.        Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
13.        The Notes shall be deemed to be New York contracts, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of said State (without reference to principles of conflicts of law).

At any time and from time to time, the Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal thereon (exclusive of interest accrued and unpaid to, but not including, the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Notes are redeemed on or after June 15, 2042 (the date that is six months prior to the Maturity Date), the Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption.
For purposes of determining the redemption price with respect to a redemption occurring prior to June 15, 2042, the following definitions shall apply:
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by a Quotation Agent as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (B) if the
 
Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all such quotations for such redemption date.
"Primary Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York.
"Quotation Agent" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company; , , that if such Reference Treasury Dealer ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
provided
however
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means any of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers, and a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and, in each case, their respective successors plus one other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company; , , that if any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
provided
however
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, and such Notes are in the form of Global Securities held by the Depositary, the Depositary will select the interests in the Notes to be redeemed in accordance with its operational arrangements. If the Notes are not in the form of Global Securities held by the Depositary, the Trustee shall select the Notes or portions thereof (in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) to be redeemed by lot or by such other method as the Trustee considers fair and appropriate.
Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in Section 3.03 of the Indenture except that any notice of redemption with respect to a redemption occurring prior to June 15, 2042 need not specify the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the calculation of the redemption price for any such redemption. The Company shall calculate such redemption price and promptly notify the Trustee thereof.
5.        If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes as described above by giving notice of such redemption to the Holders thereof, the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer")
 
to each Holder to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Notes on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased up to, but not including, the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed to Holders of the Notes describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or, if the notice is mailed prior to the Change of Control, no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date on which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurs (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (2) deposit with the paying agent (or, if the Company is acting as the Company's own paying agent, segregate and hold in trust) an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.
The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as possible after the date of purchase.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the time and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Company shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 5, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached the Company's obligations under this Section 5 by virtue of any such conflict.
 
For purposes of this Section 5, the following terms shall be applicable:
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:

7.        The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into supplemental indentures to the Indenture for the purpose of adding any
 
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series under the Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding of each series to be affected thereby on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of such series. In addition, the Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into supplemental indentures to the Indenture, without the consent of Holders, for certain purposes, including to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained in the Indenture and to make changes that do not adversely affect the rights of any Holder. The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding of each series on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults and their consequences with respect to such series under the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security or such other Notes.

10.        As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Debt Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office of the Registrar or at the offices of any transfer agent designated by the Company for such purpose. Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange or payment shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes (subject to Section 2.A hereof), whether or not such Security is overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of any Note, with certain exceptions, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
11.        This Security is a Global Security. Accordingly, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to any nominee of such successor Depositary. Ownership of beneficial interests in this Security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable Depositary or its nominee (with respect to interest of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants).
So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of this Security, the Depositary or that nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole legal owner or Holder of the Notes represented by this Security for all purposes of the Notes and the Indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in this Security (1) will not be entitled to have the Notes represented by this Security registered in their names, (2) will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated securities and (3) will not be considered the owners or Holders of the Notes represented by that beneficial interest under the Indenture for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee. Accordingly, each Person owning a beneficial interest in this Security must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if that Person is not a Depositary participant or indirect participant, on the procedures of the participant through which that Person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder of Notes under the Indenture or this Security.
Except as provided in this paragraph, beneficial interests in this Security may not be exchanged for certificated securities. In addition to the provisions set forth in Sections 2.15(c)(i) and (ii) of the Indenture, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, the Depositary will exchange this Global Security for certificated Notes that it will distribute to its participants.
Payments with respect to the principal of and interest on this Security will be payable by the Trustee to or at the direction of the Depositary or its nominee in its capacity as the registered Holder of this Security under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Company and the Trustee may treat the persons in whose names this Security are registered as the owners hereof for the purpose of receiving payment thereon (except as provided in Section 2.A hereof) and for any and all other purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Registrar, the paying agent or any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for (a) any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in this Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, (b) the payments to the beneficial owners of this Security of amounts paid to the Depositary or its nominee or (c) any other matter relating to the actions or practices of the Depositary, its nominee or any of its direct or indirect participants.
12.        Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
13.        The Notes shall be deemed to be New York contracts, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of said State (without reference to principles of conflicts of law).
