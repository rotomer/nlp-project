Item 4. .
Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
On June 25, 2002, the Board of Directors of Sigma-Aldrich Corporation ("Sigma-Aldrich"), based on the recommendation of its Audit Committee, dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as Sigma-Aldrich's independent public accountants and engaged KPMG LLP ("KPMG") to serve as Sigma-Aldrich's independent public accountants for the fiscal year 2002, effective immediately.
Andersen's reports on Sigma-Aldrich's consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through June 25, 2002, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its report on Sigma-Aldrich's consolidated financial statements for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Sigma-Aldrich requested Andersen to furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that Andersen agrees with the statements made above by Sigma-Aldrich. A copy of this letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, dated June 27, 2002, is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Current Report on Form 8K.
   
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and through June 25, 2002, Sigma-Aldrich did not consult KPMG with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Sigma-Aldrich's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Dear Sir/Madam:
The representations made in this letter are based solely on discussions and representations from the engagement partner and manager on the audits of the financial statements of this registrant for the two most recent fiscal years. Those individuals are no longer with Arthur Andersen LLP.
We have read the first, second, third and fourth paragraphs of Item 4 included in the Form 8-K dated June 25, 2002, of Sigma-Aldrich Corporation to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are in agreement with the statements contained therein.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Arthur Andersen LLP
   
Arthur Andersen LLP

Mr. Michael R. Hogan, Chief Financial Officer
Sigma-Aldrich Corporation
