99.1  Press Release issued July 23, 2002 - Sigma-Aldrich Q2 sales and EPS from continuing operations increase. 2002 EPS forecast benefits from      profit improvement initiatives and currency rates. One-time charge taken to discontinue Diagnostics business.

EXHIBIT INDEX

  Pretax income from continuing operations was 20.4% and 20.5% of related sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2002, respectively. After adjusting prior year results for goodwill amortization and a one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development, the current pretax income level shows a modest improvement over the 20.3% achieved for the entire year of 2001. Results benefited from price gains, process improvement savings and the abatement of higher utility costs that had been experienced in the first half of 2001. These benefits were offset by new costs to operate our Life Science and High Technology Center, higher insurance and employee benefit costs and the reassignment of roughly 80 former Diagnostics employees to various open positions in the continuing business. Interest expense for the first half of 2002 declined by $0.9 million from that incurred in the first half of 2001 due to interest rate reductions and reduced short-term borrowing levels resulting from lower tax payments and capital expenditures in the second quarter.

HIGHLIGHTS:
Continuing Operations:
Reported and currency adjusted sales in the 2nd quarter increased 9.6 % and 8.3%, respectively, as the U.S. dollar weakened.
Sales growth improved in Q2, driven by stronger and international sales.
Biotechnology
Diluted EPS (excluding goodwill amortization and a one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development in 2001) increased 7.4% to $.58 in the second quarter and 6.4% to $1.16 for the first six months. Currency reduced Q2 and YTD diluted EPS by $.02 and $.04, respectively.
Sales growth rates and EPS for the remainder of 2002 are both expected to benefit from a weaker dollar.
Currency adjusted sales growth in Q3 and Q4 is expected to improve over first half levels.
Expected full year 2002 diluted EPS range raised slightly to $2.26 to $2.30.
Discontinued () Operations:
Diagnostics
Smaller than expected net operating loss of $.03 per diluted share in Q2 brought YTD net operating loss to $.07.
Recorded previously announced one-time net income charge of $63 million ($.85 per share) to reflect cost of discontinuance.
Efforts to sell assets and transfer customer commitments to other vendors continue.
OVERALL RESULTS:
Continuing Operations:
Reported sales for the second quarter of 2002 for the Company's and businesses increased 9.6%. For the first time in over three years the weaker U.S. dollar enhanced reported quarterly sales gains, resulting in a lower currency adjusted sales gain of 8.3%. Growth in our and businesses improved from first quarter 2002 levels, partially as a result of the timing of observed holidays. Reported year-to-date sales growth was 7.1%. Year-to-date, currency-adjusted sales increased 7.8%, as the negative impact of exchange rates in the first quarter exceeded the benefit realized in the current quarter. Overall, the Company has experienced only modest impacts from slowed growth in the worldwide economy.

Diluted net income per share for the second quarter (adjusting 2001 results to exclude goodwill amortization) rose 7.4% to $.58 in 2002 from $.54 in 2001. Year-to-date diluted net income per share (adjusting 2001 results to exclude goodwill amortization and a one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development) increased 6.4% to $1.16 in 2002 from $1.09 in 2001. Currency impacts masked even stronger performance in the Company's underlying operations by reducing otherwise reportable second quarter and year-to-date diluted per share earnings by $.02 and $.04, respectively.
Discontinued () Operations:
Diagnostics
Ongoing efforts to sell the assets of and discontinue the business resulted in the sale of the EIA product line to IVAX Diagnostics in June 2002 and the signing of a non-binding letter of intent to sell the coagulation product line to Trinity Biotech plc. These two product lines represented approximately 42% of sales in 2001(after reclassifying products that contributed $11 million in 2001 sales to the Company's unit). Efforts to sell other product lines continue. Activities to minimize costs while continuing to supply customers under contract -- including reassignment of employees to other parts of the Company -- reduced an expected $.05 second quarter diluted EPS operating loss to an actual quarterly loss of $.03 per diluted share, bringing year-to-date operating results to a loss of $.07 per diluted share. A previously announced one-time charge of $63 million ($.85 per share) was recorded in the second quarter of 2002. This one-time charge included reductions in the carrying value of applicable assets, including unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets of $21 million, to an expected realizable amount and the costs of staff reductions. The Company continues to expect that the discontinuance of this business will provide at least $20 million in after-tax cash.

sales gains (excluding currency impacts, but including product sales reclassified from for both 2001 and 2002) improved in international markets in the second quarter while growth in sales to U.S. customers was in line with first quarter levels.

sales gains improved in the second quarter to exceed expectations. Percentage growth in key life science areas was in the mid to high teens, with sales of chromatography products providing modest growth in the quarter. Market opportunities, new product development efforts and enhanced sales activities all contributed to this improved growth.
Biotechnology
Customers continued to increase their ordering using the Company's web site. Electronic orders increased to 21% of our U.S. and 14% of our worldwide research sales.
growth moderated in the last quarter as slower growth in sales to U.S. customers was partially offset by improved gains in international markets. Booked orders, including those from pharmaceutical customers, remained strong.

OUTLOOK:
Reported sales gains from our continuing and businesses are expected to benefit from both the weakening of the U.S. dollar and the ongoing implementation of our strategic plan initiatives throughout the balance of 2002. Overall currency-adjusted sales gains in the second half of 2002 are expected to improve from those achieved to date. Pricing should continue to benefit from special initiatives in 2002. New product additions, active promotion of existing and new products, an expected continuing growth of web-based sales, the recent distribution of a new Cell Signaling and Neuroscience catalog and the issuance of new Aldrich and Fluka/Riedel-de Haen catalogs in the upcoming months are expected to drive sales growth. Additional growth from acquisitions remains questionable for 2002, as seller's expectations remain unrealistic and we remain committed to our longer-term goal to grow profits in line with sales. Profit improvement initiatives and the weaker U.S. dollar are expected to enhance earnings and management is raising its expected EPS range from continuing operations slightly to $2.26 to $2.30 for 2002. As previously announced, operating our discontinued business as assets are held for sale is expected to continue to reduce otherwise reportable diluted earnings per share by as much as $.01 in both the third and fourth quarters of the year.

Commenting on first half results and the outlook for the remainder of 2002, Chairman and CEO David Harvey said "We are encouraged by our improved growth in the second quarter. While we've certainly heard concerns about slowdowns in some of our markets, we did not see a significant change in the first half of 2002. So, we expect to improve on first half growth levels in all of our businesses with continuing selling price increases, new catalogs and promotions."
OTHER INFORMATION:
No shares were repurchased during the second quarter. Cumulative repurchases remain at 29.7 million (out of an authorized repurchase of 35 million) shares, with an average purchase price of $32.12 per share. There were 73.4 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2002. The Company expects to resume share repurchases to acquire the remaining 5.3 million authorized shares, but timing and number of shares purchased, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors.
Share Repurchase:
Initiatives to manage working capital continued in the second quarter. Accounts receivable days outstanding increased by one day from the December 31, 2001 level to 61 days as improvements in domestic receivables were offset by the stronger growth in international sales and the currency impact on valuing international receivables. Inventory management programs in continuing operations reduced inventory by nearly $16 million from prior year-end levels, but was almost exactly offset by the impact of currency in valuing inventories. These initiatives together with $26 million less in capital expenditures significantly improved cash flow, enabling us to reduce total borrowings by $103.6 million in the first half of 2002 to $344.5 million. At June 30, 2002, short-term borrowings were $167.6 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and long-term debt was $176.9 million at a weighted average interest rate of 6.6%. The Company's return on equity improved to 17.5%. We remain committed to achieving a 20% return on equity by 2004.
Working Capital, Capital Expenditures and Debt:
In April 1997, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("RBI") acquired the assets of Research Biochemicals Limited Partnership ("RBLP"), which engaged in the business of supplying research products for neuroscience discovery. The Company, RBI and an intermediate subsidiary have received charging letters from the U.S. Department of Commerce alleging that they had violated Export Administration Regulations as a result of exports by RBLP and/or RBI of certain toxins without requisite licenses between January 1995 and April 1998.  These shipments represented approximately $200,000 of revenues in total, the majority of which took place prior to the acquisition of the assets of RBLP. RBI has since applied for and received licenses for all subsequent shipments of such toxins. After attempting unsuccessfully to reach an acceptable settlement with the Department of Commerce, the Company submitted motions for summary judgment to an Administrative Law Judge, who heard arguments on the motions in June 2002 and is expected to rule on them by the end of August. If required, a trial on this matter is scheduled for October.
Export matter:
The total number of charges against the Company and its subsidiaries is 1,751.  If overlapping charges are eliminated, the total is 1,019.  The maximum possible penalty for all three entities is $10,780,000, assuming overlapping charges are eliminated.  While the charging letters do not specify the amount sought, the Department of Commerce demanded $3,760,000 to settle the case prior to the letters being sent.  The charging letters state that the Department may seek the maximum civil penalty allowed by law and, although believed unlikely, the denial of export privileges.
The Company believes there are substantial legal defenses to a number of the charges and expects that some of the charges will be dismissed and/or consolidated. Although the Company intends to defend its position vigorously, it is unable to predict the outcome of these motions or the ultimate resolution of this matter.  While the Company believes that an adverse determination on the civil penalties would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations in a given quarter or year.
