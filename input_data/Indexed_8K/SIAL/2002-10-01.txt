FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 30, 2002
SIGMA-ALDRICH AGREES TO SETTLE U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT EXPORT ALLEGATIONS
Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (NASDAQ: SIAL) announced today that it has reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Commerce Department to settle allegations that a Natick, Massachusetts subsidiary, Research Biochemicals, Inc. (RBI), exported certain scientific research toxins without first obtaining licenses from Commerce. This matter was previously disclosed in the Company's most recent earnings release (July 23, 2002) and Form 10-Q (August 14, 2002). Subject to final approval by both parties and the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, RBI will pay $1.76 million to dispose of the matter. This settlement will be reflected in the Company's 3 Quarter 2002 financial statements and will reduce otherwise reportable earnings per share by $0.02.

The Commerce Department's allegations in this case are largely based on the prior exports of a business RBI acquired in April of 1997. At the time of the acquisition, the Company had no knowledge that requisite licenses were not being obtained. Commerce contends that RBI, the Company and an intermediate subsidiary are, nonetheless, legally responsible for those pre-acquisition exports. While the Company disagrees with that contention, it believes that settlement rather than further litigation is in its best interests. The exports at issue are of a kind for which RBI has routinely obtained Commerce Department licenses since it discovered the problem in April of 1998.
Commenting on the settlement, Chairman and CEO David R. Harvey said "We regret the circumstances which led to this case but are pleased that this problem, which we inherited via an acquisition, is reaching final resolution."
