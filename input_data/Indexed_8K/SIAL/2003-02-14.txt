ITEM: Financial statements and exhibits
        Based on recent internal and customer surveys indicating that our service, catalogs, web site and life science capabilities are well recognized in and valued by the markets we serve, management believes this validates the strategic path we have chosen and contributes to our ability to grow at above market rates. We expect to be able to increase prices in 2003 at the level achieved in 2002. At current rates of exchange, we anticipate that currency will continue to boost sales and earnings growth during the first half of the coming year. Profit improvement initiatives and lower interest costs should offset both the costs of our newly-launched initiatives and continuing employee benefit and insurance cost increases, allowing the Company to maintain pre-tax margins at just over 20%. With an effective tax rate of 31% and additional share repurchase activities, EPS from continuing operations may increase by as much as 10% in 2003. While operating our discontinued business has contributed $.01 per diluted share in each of the past two quarters, continuing to operate it through the first quarter of 2003 might reduce otherwise reportable diluted earnings per share by as much as $.01.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 11, 2003
SIGMA-ALDRICH (NASDAQ: SIAL) EARNINGS UP ON 7.5% Q4 SALES GROWTH.
NEW INITIATIVES EXPECTED TO BOOST GROWTH IN 2003.
HIGHLIGHTS:
Continuing Operations:
Reported Q4 diluted EPS of $.84 includes a $.25 gain from the sale of a Milwaukee production facility and a $.02 one-time international tax benefit.
Diluted EPS increased 14.0% to $.57 in Q4 and 9.0% to $2.30 for 2002 (excluding in both periods the sale gain and tax benefit mentioned above in 2002 and goodwill amortization in 2001 and in the total year, a $.02 Commerce Department settlement in 2002 and a $.02 one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development in 2001). Changes in currency rates added $.04 and $.01 to Q4 and 2002 diluted EPS, respectively.
Reported and currency adjusted sales in Q4 increased 7.5 % and 3.7%, respectively.
Major new initiatives are expected to maintain above market sales growth rates in 2003 & beyond. Currency should continue to benefit sales & EPS growth during the first half of 2003.
Discontinued () Operations:
Diagnostics
Stronger than expected sales, coupled with reduced costs, produced net income of $.01 per diluted share in Q4, reducing full year net operating losses to $.05 per diluted share.
The one-time charge of $63 million ($.85 per diluted share) announced in Q2 declined by $5.6 million ($.07 per diluted share) and $5.1 million ($.07 per diluted share) in Q3 and Q4, respectively, as a result of sales of product lines, as well as reduced, anticipated employee and customer separation costs related to these product lines.
Activities to discontinue operations are expected to wrap up by end Q1 2003.
Diagnostics
Financial Condition:
Return on equity showed strong improvement to 19.5% at the end of 2002, with a revised expectation that the Company should meet its 20% goal one-year ahead of schedule in 2003.
Working capital management reduced otherwise reportable year-end 2002 accounts receivable and inventory levels by $49 million (excluding currency effects) versus year-end 2001 levels.
Strong cash flow from operations and working capital management lowered outstanding debt by $181 million in 2002.
OVERALL RESULTS:
Continuing Operations:
Reported sales for the Company's and businesses combined increased 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. A weaker U.S. dollar enhanced this reported quarterly sales gain by 3.8%. Thus, currency adjusted sales growth, a measure used by management to judge its controllable growth, was 3.7%. Our earlier expectation that third quarter growth rates would be maintained in the fourth quarter were not fully realized, as a sequential quarterly improvement in pricing in Q4 2002 compared to Q3 2002 matched with unit volume comparable to that of the final quarter of 2001. Reported sales growth for the full year was 8.3%, with 1.4% of that growth coming from favorable currency rate changes.

Diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter was $.84, with $.25 of this amount resulting from a gain on the sale of a major Company production facility in Milwaukee to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation to facilitate reconstruction of the Marquette Interchange section of that city's freeway system. Excluding this gain and a one-time international tax benefit of $.02 per diluted share in 2002, and goodwill amortization in 2001, fourth quarter EPS rose 14.0% to $.57 from $.50 in 2001. A $.04 currency benefit is included in fourth quarter 2002 EPS results. Full year 2002 diluted net income per share increased 9.0% to $2.30 from $2.11 in 2001, excluding the same non-recurring items noted above for the fourth quarter, as well as a $.02 Commerce Department settlement explained in our earlier earnings release for results through September 30and a $.02 one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development in 2001. Reported full year diluted per share earnings included a $.01 currency benefit.

Discontinued () Operations:

Through December 31, 2002, the Company has sold product lines representing approximately 70% of sales in 2001 (after reclassifying products that contributed $11 million to 2001 sales to the Company's unit in both 2001 and 2002). Efforts to sell other product lines and reduce inventories through sales to customers continue, with the expectation that all such activities will be substantially concluded by the end of Q1 2003. Sales resulting from supplying customers under contract and inventory liquidations provided diluted EPS of $.01 in the fourth quarter, reducing year-to-date operating losses to $.05 per diluted share. The $63 million ($.85 per diluted share) one-time charge recorded in Q2 was reduced to $52.3 million ($.71 per diluted share) by year-end. $5.6 million ($.07 per diluted share) and $5.1 million ($.07 per diluted share) of offsetting benefits were realized in the year's final two quarters, respectively, as a result of sales of product lines, as well as reduced, anticipated employee and customer separation costs related to these product lines. Full year after-tax cash provided by discontinuation of the unit increased to $32.5 million from the $20.0 million announced at the time the one-time charge was first recorded in the second quarter.

CEO's Statement:
Looking back on the results for 2002, Chairman and CEO David Harvey said: "The underlying strength of our Company enabled us to continue to achieve above market growth in sales and comparable growth in earnings against the backdrop of a sluggish worldwide economy. And the initiatives that originally accelerated our growth have served us well over the last three years. They helped us to maintain pre-tax margins at 20%+ in 2002. And I believe they will help us to achieve our 20% ROE goal a year ahead of schedule in 2003. While we are pleased with these results, we are not complacent. We announced several key organizational changes and major new initiatives in sales, marketing, operations and process improvement at the end of 2002. And we expect these to add the focus and energy needed to enable us to continue to exceed market growth rates in sales and improve profitability in 2003 and beyond."
NET INCOME ANALYSIS:
The Company's reported Q4 and full year net income and diluted earnings per share for continuing and discontinued operations, before and after currency impacts in 2002, goodwill amortization in 2001 and other one-time benefits and charges in 2002 and 2001, are summarized below:

RESULTS FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS (all percentage comparisons are to comparable periods in 2001):
Reported sales increased 7.5% to $296.3 million for the fourth quarter and 8.3% to $1.2 billion for the year. Ongoing price increases provided 3.7% and 3.2% of the fourth quarter and full year gain, respectively. After achieving volume gains of almost 5% during the first three quarters, fourth quarter volumes were only in-line with prior year levels, bringing full year unit volume gains to 3.7%. Reported and currency adjusted sales gains were as follows:

After achieving targeted, currency adjusted sales growth goals of 8% in and 12% for both and in 2001 and continuing at above market growth rates early in 2002, economic uncertainties and lower demand from pharmaceutical and other commercial customers slowed growth late in 2002.

Currency adjusted sales gains in the fourth quarter benefited from continued price increases of 5% that were partially offset by declining unit volume in the U.S. and more modest volume growth in international markets.
Scientific Research:
After reporting increasing, sequential gains across the first three quarters of 2002, sales gains moderated in Q4. Price gains remained in line with nine month year-to-date results at 3%. Sales to U.S. customers were flat in Q4, while sales to international customers remained strong. Much of the change in the U.S. reflects reduced fourth quarter demand for synthetic DNA, offsetting the strong increases in demand for such products experienced earlier in the year. Overall percentage growth in other key life science areas remained at the mid-teen levels experienced in Q3 2002.
Biotechnology:
Continued enhancements to the capabilities and content of the Company's web site resulted in its recognition as the #1 site in a recent survey by . Electronic orders continued their steady sequential quarterly gain, increasing to 24% of our U.S. and 16% of our worldwide research sales in Q4.
Web-based Research (Scientific Research and Biotechnology) Sales:
Bioinformatics
Sales growth remained in line with that experienced in the third quarter, reflecting ongoing weaker demand for custom orders from U.S. pharmaceutical customers compared to that experienced in the first half of 2002. We continue to achieve double-digit growth in international markets. Booked orders from both pharmaceutical and commercial customers, one of this unit's leading indicators of results to come, increased to levels experienced early in the year.
Fine Chemicals:
Overall reported pretax income from continuing operations, excluding the gain from the property sale in Milwaukee noted above, was 20.1% of sales for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2002. Excluding the Milwaukee property sale gain and the settlement with the Commerce Department from 2002 results and goodwill amortization and a one-time charge for purchased in-process research and development from 2001 results, adjusted 2002 pretax income of 20.3% of sales was also equal to that achieved in 2001. Price gains, process improvement savings and lower interest costs all benefited these results. The costs of operating our new Life Science and High Technology Center, higher insurance and employee benefit costs and the reassignment of roughly 90 former employees to various open positions in our continuing businesses exactly offset these benefits.
Diagnostics
Overall, the otherwise reportable effective tax rate of 31.0% increased to 31.4% in 2002 from 30.3% in 2001, as the international tax benefit in 2002 was more than offset by the non-deductibility of the Commerce Department settlement and a higher incremental tax rate on the Milwaukee property sale.
OUTLOOK:
Currency adjusted sales are expected to continue at the growth rate achieved in 2002, with the potential to improve on this performance as our major new initiatives take hold throughout 2003. Accelerated sales growth should come from using our "One Company" approach and process improvement techniques in sales, marketing, business development and R&D. We believe this approach will enable us to better serve our customers and achieve our targeted currency adjusted internal growth rates of 8%, 12% and 12% for and , respectively, over the longer term. Growth should come from further expansion of our sales force, the hiring of additional research scientists and the launch of the following new initiatives in four broad areas:
Scientific Research, Biotechnology
Fine Chemicals
Sales
Global coordination of sales efforts across all three business units
Expansion of key account focus in major geographic markets
Increased sales representative productivity using proven process improvement techniques
Marketing
Expansion and spread of successful tactical marketing programs to all business units
Improved integration between lead management and field sales representatives' activities
Business Development
Accelerated acquisitions and in-licensing of products and technology platforms
Increased integration with tactical R&D, sales and marketing in all three business units
Research and Development
Improved new product selection processes
Reduced cycle times for new product launches using proven process improvement techniques

OTHER INFORMATION:
At a meeting held today, the Company's Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.09 per share, payable on March 14, 2003 to shareholders of record on February 28, 2003.
Dividend:
Through December 31, 2002, a total of 32.2 million shares (out of an authorized repurchase of 35 million shares) had been acquired at an average purchase price of $33.41 per share. There were 71.3 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2002. Additional shares purchased to date bring total repurchases to 32.4 million shares. The Company expects to continue share repurchases to acquire the remaining 2.6 million authorized shares, but the timing and number of shares purchased, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors.
Share Repurchase:
Working capital management initiatives continued to enhance the Company's cash position during the fourth quarter. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 57 at December 31, 2002 improved by three days from the prior year-end, providing more than $19 million of cash in 2002. Active inventory management programs reduced inventory levels by one month from 9.0 months on hand at year-end 2001 to 8.0 months at year-end 2002, representing a reduction in quantities of $30 million from prior year-end levels. The impact of currency rates used in valuing receivables and inventories offset roughly $13 million and $24 million, respectively, of those cash reductions. These initiatives, significantly lower capital expenditure levels, reduced tax payments related to the one-time charge for the discontinuation of operations and the cash received on sale of the Milwaukee property combined to generatesufficient cash flow to reduce total borrowings by $181 million in 2002 to $267 million. Our working capital initiatives are ongoing and capital expenditures for 2003 are expected to be roughly equal to the $60 million expenditure for 2002. At December 31, 2002, short-term borrowings were $90 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.4% and long-term debt was $177 million at a weighted average interest rate of 6.5%. The Company's return on equity improved to 19.5%, with an expectation of achieving the targeted 20% return on equity in 2003, one year earlier than originally promised.

In June 2002, KPMG LLP replaced Arthur Andersen LLP as the Company's external auditor. As a result of our decision to discontinue ,accounting standards require the restatement of prior period financials solely to present separate results for continuing and discontinued operations. Due to the inability of our previous external auditor to issue an opinion on such restatements, KPMG re-audited and will issue an unqualified opinion on the Company's financial statements for 2000 and 2001, as well as on its financial statements for 2002.
