HIGHLIGHTS:
Continuing Operations:

Fine Chemicals
Diluted EPS for Q1 increased 17.2% to $.68.
New sales and marketing initiatives are expected to boost currency adjusted sales growth in the upcoming quarters of 2003. Diluted EPS estimate for 2003 increased from earlier guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.65.
Financial Condition:
Return on equity improved to 19.9% at March 31, 2003, largely achieving the Company's 20% goal more than one year earlier than initially projected.
Working capital management continued to reduce accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory months on hand.
Strong cash flow from operations and working capital management in Q1 reduced outstanding debt by almost $32 million from December 31, 2002.
OVERALL RESULTS:
Continuing Operations:
Reported sales for the Company's and businesses combined increased 11.0% in the first quarter of 2003 as compared to the first quarter of 2002. Currency benefits contributed 8.5% of this sales gain, with an overall price gain offset by a modest decline in unit volumes providing the other 2.5% of the growth. Currency adjusted sales growth for Sand remained consistent with that experienced in the final quarter of 2002, while sales of continued to be impacted by declines in sales to U.S. pharmaceutical companies.

Diluted net income per share in the first quarter of 2003 rose 17.2% to $.68 from $.58 in 2002, including a $.06 benefit from currency exchange rates.
Discontinued () Operations:
Diagnostics
Sales from continued inventory liquidations provided diluted EPS of $.02 in the first quarter. These inventory liquidations and reductions in anticipated employee and customer separation costs to discontinue this business also added $1.6 million to net income and $.02 to diluted EPS, reducing the cumulative one-time charge of $52.3 million ($.71 per diluted share) recorded in 2002. No additional product lines have been sold since December 31, 2002 and all activities to do so have been completed. In total, the Company sold product lines representing approximately 70% of sales in 2001.
Diagnostics
RESULTS FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS (all percentage comparisons are to first quarter 2002):
The 11.0% reported sales increase boosted Q1 sales to $334.7 million from $301.6 million in 2002. Strong gains in international currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar generated 8.5% of this gain. Price increases provided another 3.1% of the first quarter growth, generally in line with the 3.2% gain achieved for all of 2002. Overall unit volumes were off slightly as sales (excluding currency benefits) declined in the quarter. Reported sales growth, currency benefits and currency adjusted sales changes (a measure used by management to judge its controllable, local currency growth) were as follows:

Currency adjusted sales gains in the first quarter benefited from price increases of 4.1%. Lower unit volume in the U.S., due to reduced demand from pharmaceutical companies as well as the impact of spending controls and funding delays in non-profit accounts, partially offset the price gain. Currency adjusted growth in international markets exceeded 7%, largely in-line with that achieved for all of 2002.
Scientific Research:
Price gains of 2.8% were matched with overall unit volume growth of 4.4%, producing currency adjusted sales growth in the first quarter comparable to that achieved in the final quarter of 2002. A modest reduction in sales to U.S. customers, due largely to reduced demand for synthetic DNA, was offset by stronger growth in sales to international customers.
Biotechnology:
Continuing enhancement and promotion of the Company's web site (rated #1 by in 2002) increased electronic orders to 26% of our U.S. and 18% of our worldwide research sales in Q1.
Web-based Research (Scientific Research and Biotechnology) Sales:
Bioinformatics
Sales in the first quarter continued to reflect the weaker demand for custom orders from U.S. pharmaceutical customers that began in the second half of 2002. We continue to achieve strong growth in international markets. Booked orders remained in-line with the year-end 2002 level, with an expectation that these orders should boost quarterly sales growth in the upcoming quarters of 2003.

Reported pretax income from continuing operations was 20.9% of sales for the first quarter of 2003, up from 20.5% of sales for the first quarter of 2002 as a result of lower interest costs from both reduced rates and borrowings. Operating income levels were 21.8% of sales in the first quarter of both 2003 and 2002. Benefits from continuing process improvement activities were supplemented by reductions in bad debt and lower advertising costs. These benefits were offset by higher utility, insurance, legal defense and employee benefit costs.
A reduction in the effective tax rate to 30.2% reflects modest increases in various tax credits as well as reductions in overall international and state tax rates. The effective tax rate for all of 2003 should remain near this level, with minor variations in upcoming quarters based on changes in activity levels in tax credit generating functions and sales mix changes in geographic areas due primarily to new strategic sales and marketing initiatives.
OUTLOOK:
Our previously shared expectation that the overall currency adjusted sales growth rate for 2003 would be roughly in-line with the 7% gain achieved in 2002 remains. Price gains are expected to remain in line with first quarter results, while new sales and marketing initiatives are expected to progressively boost volume gains in the upcoming quarters of 2003. Sequential quarterly improvement in currency adjusted sales gains is expected from sales coordination across our three business units, the addition of sales representatives and the refocusing and spread of marketing campaigns. About one-fourth of the expected addition of 30 U.S. sales representatives has been completed to date, with an equivalent addition expected in the current quarter. New marketing programs are being progressively rolled out, with initial emphasis in the high growth areas of molecular biology and cell signaling being followed by targeted campaigns in other key life science and fine chemicals areas. While these programs are implemented and gain momentum, ongoing efforts to gain market share by promoting existing products and capabilities are also expected to enhance short-term sales growth.
These sales and marketing initiatives and new product additions from business development and research and development activities should enable us to better serve our customers, resulting in improved quarterly sales growth that approaches our targeted currency adjusted internal growth rates of 8%, 12% and 12% for and , respectively, in the final quarter of 2003.We expect to maintain these growth rates over the longer term once they have been achieved.
Scientific Research, Biotechnology
Fine Chemicals
At current rates of exchange, we anticipate that currency will continue to benefit sales and earnings growth in the upcoming quarters of 2003, although generally at reduced rates from those achieved in the first quarter, particularly in the second half of 2003. Continued benefits from profit improvement initiatives and lower interest costs should offset the increasing costs of our new sales and marketing initiatives, employee benefits and insurance, allowing us to maintain pre-tax margins at just over 20%. Additional modest share repurchase activities should also benefit EPS increases. Based on these expectations, management is raising its estimate of projected diluted EPS from continuing operations for all of 2003 to a range of $2.60 to $2.65.
With over 50% of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management uses currency-adjusted growth, and believes it is useful to investors, to judge the Company's controllable, local currency performance. While we are able to report currency impacts after the fact, we are unable to estimate changes that may occur during the remainder of 2003 to applicable rates of exchange and are thus unable to provide a reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP currency adjusted internal growth rates to reported GAAP growth rates for the year 2003 as required by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies.
CEO's STATEMENT
:
Commenting on the first quarter performance and outlook for 2003, Chairman and CEO David Harvey said, "Given the current economy and conditions in our markets, I am pleased with our sales growth, our ability to maintain profit margins, and our significant growth in earnings per share. While currency has given us a nice lift, we'll continue to run our business on what we can control. I am encouraged by our level of activity in launching new sales and marketing initiatives as well as by our ability to build on process improvement accomplishments as we seek to achieve our targeted growth in sales, earnings and return on equity. We have shared our new initiatives with all 6,000 of our employees worldwide. They are actively involved to boost sales growth and maintain profit margins in 2003. With our new management assignments and initiatives and an increased level of energy throughout the Company, we fully expect to improve on first quarter sales growth in the remaining quarters of 2003."
OTHER INFORMATION:
Through March 31, 2003, a total of 32.6 million shares (out of an authorized repurchase of 35 million shares) had been acquired since beginning the program in late 1999 at an average purchase price of $33.52 per share. There were 71.1 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2003. The Company expects to continue share repurchases to acquire the remaining 2.4 million authorized shares, but the timing and number of shares purchased, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors.
Share Repurchase:
Initiatives to manage the working capital of the Company continued in the first quarter, taking our achievements to new levels. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to 54 days, a reduction of 3 days from the December 31, 2002 level. Active inventory management programs reduced inventory levels to 7.7 months on hand at March 31, 2003 from 8.0 months at year-end 2002, representing a reduction in quantities of $8 million from prior year-end levels. These initiatives, together with increased cash from operations and lower capital expenditure levels, combined to generatesufficient cash flow to reduce total borrowings by almost $32 million in the first three months of 2003. At March 31, 2003, short-term borrowings were $58 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.3% and long-term debt was $177 million at a weighted average interest rate of 6.6%. The Company's return on equity improved to 19.9%, largely achieving our targeted 20% return on equity more than one year earlier than originally promised.
