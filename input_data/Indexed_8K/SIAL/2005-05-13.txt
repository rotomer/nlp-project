Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements
 
 
 
These financial statements have been prepared for the purpose of enabling the inclusion of financial information in respect of the divestment of CSL US Inc. Subject to the basis of preparation outlined in this note, these financial statements comply with Australian accounting standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and Urgent Issues Group Consensus views (Australian GAAP).
 
There have been departures from the disclosure requirements of Australian accounting standards where they are considered to be not applicable given the nature of these financial statements. In particular AASB 1034: Financial Report Presentation and Disclosures in respect of the disclosure of financial information for comparative periods.
 
The financial information included herein may not reflect the financial position, operating results or cash flows of CSL US Inc. under a different owner.
 
 
All amounts are expressed in United States dollars, rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise disclosed.
 
 
Tax-effect accounting is applied using the liability method whereby income tax is regarded as an expense and is calculated on the accounting profit after allowing for permanent differences. To the extent timing differences occur between the time items are recognised in the financial statements and when items are taken into account in determining taxable income, the net related taxation benefit or liability, calculated at current rates, is disclosed as a future income tax benefit or a provision for deferred income tax. The net future income tax benefit relating to tax losses is not carried forward as an asset unless the benefit is virtually certain of being realised.
 
 
Non-current assets measured using the cost basis are not carried at an amount above their recoverable amount, and where carrying values exceed this recoverable amount, assets are written down. In determining recoverable amount, the expected net cash flows have been discounted to their present value using a market determined, risk adjusted rate of 9.5%.
 
 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity and the revenue can be reliably measured.

Cash on hand and in banks and short-term deposits are stated at nominal value.
 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash includes cash on hand and at call deposits with banks or financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, net of bank overdrafts.
 
Bank overdrafts are carried at the principal amount. Interest is charged as an expense as it accrues.
 
 
Current receivables are recognised and carried at the nominal amount due. They are non-interest bearing and have various repayment terms. Refer Note 19 for related party receivables.
 
 
Liabilities for creditors and other amounts are carried at cost which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in the future for goods and services received, whether or not billed to the consolidated entity.
 
Trade and other creditors are non-interest bearing and have various repayment terms.
 
 
Interest bearing liabilities are carried at nominal amount. Refer also, Note 12.
 
 
Shares are carried at the lower of cost and recoverable amount.

This disclosure was published in the CSL Limited Group 30 June 2004 Financial Report and may not be applicable to CSL US Inc under different ownership.
 
The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is adopting International Financial Reporting Standards for application to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. This means that the CSL Group will be required to prepare financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2006 that comply with Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards (AIFRS) and their related pronouncements as issued and recognised by the AASB.
 
The CSL Group will report its compliance with AIFRS for the first time for the half-year ended 31 December 2005. The transitional rules for the first time adoption of AIFRS require that entities restate their comparative financial statements using all Australian equivalents of IFRSs, except for AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
 
The majority of the adjustments required on transition are required to be made to opening retained earnings in the opening AIFRS balance sheet as at 1 July 2004. However, transitional adjustments relating to those standards where comparatives are not required will be made to opening retained earnings at 1 July 2005. Comparatives restated under AIFRS will not be reported in the financial statements until 31 December 2005, being the first half year reported in compliance with AIFRS.
 
The CSL Group established a formal AIFRS Steering Committee in 2003 to plan and manage the convergence to AIFRS, monitor the developments in AIFRS and ensure it is prepared to report under AIFRS in accordance with the timetable outlined above. The AIFRS Steering Committee includes senior members of management, is monitored by the Group Finance Director, and reports to the Audit and Risk Management Committee on the progress towards transition. As a part of the project for the implementation of AIFRS, the AIFRS Steering Committee set-up seven specific project teams, each responsible for evaluating the impact of a specific group of accounting changes associated with the transition to AIFRS. In addition, a dedicated resource for the project was employed during the year.
 
The project has been separated into four phases - Impact analysis, design and planning, solution development and implementation. The impact analysis and design and planning phases are largely completed and work has begun on the solution development and implementation phases. Internal training on AIFRS has already been conducted for several subsidiaries and divisions in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.

Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements (Cont)
 
Set out below are the key areas where accounting policies will change and may have an impact on the financial statements of the CSL Group. It should be noted that at this stage the CSL Group has not fully quantified the impacts of each area on the financial statements.
 
The key areas are as follows:
 
Under AASB 3 Business Combinations, goodwill acquired in a business combination will not be amortised. Instead it will be subject to annual impairment testing focussing on the cash flows of related cash generating units. This will result in a change to the current accounting policy, under which goodwill is both amortised on a straight line basis over the period during which the benefits are expected to arise, and not exceeding 20 years, and subject to a recoverable amounts review.
Goodwill
 
The CSL Group does not currently recognise an asset or liability for the net position of the defined benefit schemes it sponsors, except for the recognition of any net liabilities on acquisition of controlled entities. Under AASB 119 Employee Benefits the CSL Group will be required to recognise the net position of each scheme based on actuarial valuations on the statement of financial position. The initial adjustment on transition will be recognised through retained earnings and subsequent adjustments will be to the statement of financial performance.
Employee Benefits
 
The CSL Group currently does not recognise an expense for options or performance rights issued under the current plans. Under AASB 2 Share-based Payments, the CSL Group will be required to recognise an expense for all share-based remuneration issued after 7 November 2002 which has not vested as at 1 January 2005. The expense is based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the grant date.
Share-based Payments
 
Under AASB 112 Income Taxes a new method of accounting for income taxes, known as the "balance sheet liability method", will be adopted, replacing the current "tax effect income statement" approach used by the CSL Group. The new method recognises deferred tax balances in the statement of financial position when there is a difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base. Adoption of this new method may result in increased deferred tax assets and liabilities and, as tax effects follow the underlying transaction, some tax effects will be recognised directly in equity.
Income Taxes
 
Where government grants are provided for the acquisition or construction of a long-term asset, AASB 120 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance requires the amount of the grant to be recognised as income over the periods necessary to match the grant with the related costs that are intended to be compensated. Under current Australian Accounting Standards, such grants are recognised immediately as revenue.
Government Grants
 
AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is required to be adopted by the CSL Group prospectively from 1 July 2005. This standard requires all financial instruments to be recognised in the statement of financial position and all derivatives and most financial assets to be carried at fair market value. AASB 139 recognises fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting and hedges of investments in foreign operations. Fair value and cash flow hedge accounting can only be considered where designation, documentation and effectiveness tests are met on both a prospective and retrospective basis. Ineffectiveness outside the prescribed range precludes the use of hedge accounting and may result in amounts recognised in the statement of financial performance, which had not been recognised previously.

Interest Rate Risk Exposure
 
CSL US Inc is exposed to interest rate risk through primary financial assets and liabilities. Under CSL Group Treasury policies the entity is not permitted to enter into derivative financial instruments.
 
The following table summarises interest rate risk for the entity together with effective interest rates as at balance date.
 
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
CSL US Inc transactions are all conducted in US dollars.
 
Credit Risk
 
Credit risk represents the extent of credit related losses that the entity may be subject to on amounts to be received from financial instruments. The entity, while exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial instruments, does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at balance date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of any provision for doubtful debts, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements.
 
The location of all credit risk in CSL US Inc is the USA, with the concentration of financial assets by industry classification is 82% financial institutions and 18% other.
 
Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities
 
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities held at balance date approximates their net fair value.

The accompanying financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Australia (AGAAP). Certain differences exist between AGAAP and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (USGAAP). The accompanying financial statements could be materially affected by differences between USGAAP and AGAAP in accounting for the following:
 
Income Tax
 
USGAAP requires a "balance sheet" approach to calculating tax effect balances while AGAAP adopts a "profit and loss" approach to income tax accounting (refer to Note 1(c)). Under USGAAP, entities are required to calculate deferred income taxes based on temporary differences, which are the differences between the carrying amount of assets/liabilities for financial statement purposes and their basis for income tax purposes.
 
Income Statement Presentation
 
USGAAP requires that the gain on sale be reflected in other income as the net of sales price and carrying value. AGAAP requires the proceeds to be classified as revenue and the net gain disclosed separately.
 
If the accompanying financial statements had been prepared in accordance with USGAAP, the financial position and results of operations could be materially different than as accounted for under AGAAP.
CSL US Inc.
Directors' Declaration
 
We, being the directors of CSL Limited, as vendors of CSL US Inc, state that: the financial statements and associated notes of CSL US Inc:
 
(i) presents fairly the Company's financial position as at 30 June 2004 and of its performance for the 12 months ended on that date; and
 
(ii) comply with the Accounting Standards as outlined in Notes 1 and 23 to the financial statements.
 
 
The Board of Directors of CSL Limited
 
We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of CSL US Inc. as of June 30, 2004, and the related statement of financial performance, and cash flows for the one-year period ended June 30, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CSL US Inc. at June 30, 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the one-year period ended June 30, 2004, in conformity with Australian generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to and forming part of the Combined Financial Statements
 
 
 
In August 2004, CSL Limited (CSL) commenced a trade sale process of its JRH business.
 
The entities involved are JRH Biosciences, Inc, JRH Biosciences Ltd and JRH Biosciences Pty Ltd ("JRH Group").
 
These combined financial statements have been prepared for the purpose of enabling the inclusion of financial information in respect of the divestment of the JRH Group. Subject to the basis of preparation outlined in this note, these financial statements comply with Australian accounting standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and Urgent Issues Group Consensus views (Australian GAAP).
 
There have been departures from the disclosure requirements of Australian accounting standards where they are considered to be not applicable given the nature of these combined financial statements. In particular, AASB 1018: Statement of Financial Performance, AASB 1034: Financial Report Presentation and Disclosures and AASB 1040: Statement of Financial Position, to the extent that they relate to disclosures of Equity, the components of Equity and the movements therein and AASB 1034 in respect of the disclosure of financial information in respect of comparative periods.
 
Furthermore, the combined financial statements are a combination of the JRH entities, wholly owned within the CSL Limited Group, control of which was transferred by this transaction. In preparing the combined financial statements, the effects of all transactions between entities within the JRH Group have been eliminated.
 
The financial information included herein may not reflect the financial position, operating results or cash flows of the JRH Group under a different ownership structure.
 
 
All amounts are expressed in United States dollars, rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated. The entities within the JRH Group whose functional currencies are Australian dollars and UK pounds have been translated into United States dollars at the applicable closing rates (for items in the statement of financial position) and the average rates for the period (for items in the statement of financial performance and cash flows). The applicable exchange rates used are as follows:

Tax-effect accounting is applied using the liability method whereby income tax is regarded as an expense and is calculated on the accounting profit after allowing for permanent differences. To the extent timing differences occur between the time items are recognised in the financial statements and when items are taken into account in determining taxable income, the net related taxation benefit or liability, calculated at current rates, is disclosed as a future income tax benefit or a provision for deferred income tax. The net future income tax benefit relating to tax losses is not carried forward as an asset unless the benefit is virtually certain of being realised.
 
The current tax provision has been prepared on the basis of separate tax returns being lodged for individual entities in the respect of jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction and choices made regarding tax consolidation, the tax provision may not ultimately be payable to the tax authorities. In certain instances it may be payable to the head entity in the tax consolidated group.
 
 
All inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity.
 
 
The purchase method of accounting is used for all acquisitions of assets regardless of whether shares or other assets are acquired. Cost is measured as the fair value of consideration given at the date of acquisition plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
 
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of the acquisition. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.
 
Provisions for restructuring costs and related employee termination benefits are recognised as at the date of acquisition of an entity on the basis described in the accounting policy notes.
 
Where goodwill arises, it is brought to account on the basis described in Note 1(j).
 
 
Freehold land and buildings are recorded at cost which is not in excess of the recoverable amount. Provision for depreciation of buildings has been made.
 
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation or amortisation which is not in excess of the recoverable amount. Capital work in progress is stated at cost.
 
Property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, are depreciated over their economic lives on a straight line basis as follows:
 
 
 
JRH Group
Notes to and forming part of the Combined Financial Statements (Cont)
 
 
 
Non-current assets measured using the cost basis are not carried at an amount above their recoverable amount, and where carrying values exceed this recoverable amount, assets are written down. In determining recoverable amount, the expected net cash flows have been discounted to their present value using a market determined, risk adjusted rate of 9.5%.
 
 
The cost of improvements to leasehold properties is amortised over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement whichever is the shorter.
 
 
The minimum lease payments of operating leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased item, are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis.
 
 
On acquisition of some or all of the assets of another entity, the identifiable net assets acquired are measured at their fair value. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration plus incidental expenses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets is brought to account as goodwill and is amortised on a straight line basis over 10 years being the period of expected benefit. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each reporting date by the directors and written down where it is considered that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
 
 
Current expenditure on research and development and on patents is charged against profit from ordinary activities as incurred. Expenditure on equipment used in research and development activities is capitalised in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over its estimated useful life.
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal, equitable or constructive obligation to make a future sacrifice of economic benefits to other entities as a result of past transactions or other past events, it is probable that future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
 
 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
 
Sales Revenue
 
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of products external to the consolidated entity. Sales revenue is recognised when title of the goods has passed to the buyer.
 
Interest Income
 
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
 
Other Revenue
 
Other revenue, including government grants, is recognised when the entitlement is confirmed.

Cash on hand and in banks and short-term deposits are stated at nominal value.
 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash includes cash on hand and at call deposits with banks or financial institutions and investments in money market instruments, net of bank overdrafts.
 
Bank overdrafts are carried at the principal amount. Interest is charged as an expense as it accrues.
 
 
Trade debtors are initially recorded at the amount of the contracted sale proceeds. Provision for doubtful debts is recognised to the extent that recovery of the outstanding receivable balance is considered no longer probable.
 
Other debtors and other receivables are recognised and carried at the nominal amount due. They are non-interest bearing and have various repayment terms.
 
 
Liabilities for trade creditors and other amounts are carried at cost which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in the future for goods and services received, whether or not billed to the consolidated entity.
 
Trade and other creditors are non-interest bearing and have various repayment terms.
 
 
Provision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to reporting date. These benefits include wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and other post retirement benefits.
 
Employee benefits including on costs, expected to be settled within one year together with benefits arising from wages and salaries and annual leave which will be settled after one year, have been measured at their nominal amounts based on remuneration rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. Long service leave and other post retirement benefits, including on costs, payable later than one year have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made for those benefits.
 
Employee benefits expenses and revenues are charged against profits on a net basis in their respective categories.
 
Superannuation Plans
 
Contributions to superannuation plans are expensed in the year they are paid or become payable. No employees of entities in the combined business are members of defined benefit superannuation plans.
 
 
Certain employees are entitled to participate in equity-based compensation schemes under which they receive equity instruments issued by the ultimate parent (CSL Limited).
 
No remuneration expense is recognised in respect of issues made through the equity-based compensation schemes.
 
Entities in the combined business do not operate any equity-based compensation schemes.

Objectives for holding derivative financial instruments
 
Under CSL Group Treasury policies the JRH Group are not permitted to enter into derivative financial instruments transactions. Where an entity within the group is exposed to exchange rate movements, CSL Group Treasury will enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency balances.
 
Interest Rate Risk Exposure
 
JRH Group is exposed to interest rate risk through primary financial assets and liabilities.
 
The following table summarises interest rate risk for the entity together with effective interest rates as at balance date.
 
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
CSL Group Treasury enters into forward exchange contracts to buy and sell specified amounts of foreign currencies in the future at predetermined exchanges rates on behalf of JRH Biosciences Pty Ltd. The objective is to match the contracts with committed future cash flows from sales in foreign currencies to protect the entity against exchange rate movements. Contracts are entered into by CSL Group Treasury from time to time in order to maintain a desired hedged position.
 
The following table summarises by currency the US dollar value of forward exchange agreements at balance date. Foreign currency amounts are translated at rates prevailing at reporting date.
 
 
The JRH Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through primary financial assets and liabilities. The following table, expressed in US dollars, summarises the foreign exchange risk carried by the combined JRH Group as a result of the existence of foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities.

Credit Risk
 
Credit risk represents the extent of credit related losses that the JRH Group may be subject to on amounts to be received from financial instruments. The JRH Group, while exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial instruments, does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at balance date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of any provision for doubtful debts, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements.
 
 
Concentration of credit risk on financial assets is indicated in the following table by percentage of the total balance receivable from customers in the specified categories:
 
 
Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities
 
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities held at balance date approximates their net fair value.
 
 
This disclosure was published in the CSL Limited Group 30 June 2004 Financial Report and may not be applicable to the Combined JRH Group post CSL's ownership of JRH.
 
The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is adopting International Financial Reporting Standards for application to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. This means that the CSL Group will be required to prepare financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2006 that comply with Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards (AIFRS) and their related pronouncements as issued and recognised by the AASB.
 
The CSL Group will report its compliance with AIFRS for the first time for the half-year ended 31 December 2005. The transitional rules for the first time adoption of AIFRS require that entities restate their comparative financial statements using all Australian equivalents of IFRSs, except for AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
 
The majority of the adjustments required on transition are required to be made to opening retained earnings in the opening AIFRS balance sheet as at 1 July 2004. However, transitional adjustments relating to those standards where comparatives are not required will be made to opening retained earnings at 1 July 2005. Comparatives restated under AIFRS will not be reported in the financial statements until 31 December 2005, being the first half year reported in compliance with AIFRS.

The CSL Group established a formal AIFRS Steering Committee in 2003 to plan and manage the convergence to AIFRS, monitor the developments in AIFRS and ensure it is prepared to report under AIFRS in accordance with the timetable outlined above. The AIFRS Steering Committee includes senior members of management, is monitored by the Group Finance Director, and reports to the Audit and Risk Management Committee on the progress towards transition. As a part of the project for the implementation of AIFRS, the AIFRS Steering Committee set-up seven specific project teams, each responsible for evaluating the impact of a specific group of accounting changes associated with the transition to AIFRS. In addition, a dedicated resource for the project was employed during the year.
 
The project has been separated into four phases - Impact analysis, design and planning, solution development and implementation. The impact analysis and design and planning phases are largely completed and work has begun on the solution development and implementation phases. Internal training on AIFRS has already been conducted for several subsidiaries and divisions in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.
 
Set out below are the key areas where accounting policies will change and may have an impact on the financial statements of the CSL Group. It should be noted that at this stage the CSL Group has not fully quantified the impacts of each area on the financial statements.
 
The key areas are as follows:
 
Under AASB 3 Business Combinations, goodwill acquired in a business combination will not be amortised. Instead it will be subject to annual impairment testing focussing on the cash flows of related cash generating units. This will result in a change to the current accounting policy, under which goodwill is both amortised on a straight line basis over the period during which the benefits are expected to arise, and not exceeding 20 years, and subject to a recoverable amounts review.
Goodwill
 
The CSL Group does not currently recognise an asset or liability for the net position of the defined benefit schemes it sponsors, except for the recognition of any net liabilities on acquisition of controlled entities. Under AASB 119 Employee Benefits the CSL Group will be required to recognise the net position of each scheme based on actuarial valuations on the statement of financial position. The initial adjustment on transition will be recognised through retained earnings and subsequent adjustments will be to the statement of financial performance.
Employee Benefits
 
The CSL Group currently does not recognise an expense for options or performance rights issued under the current plans. Under AASB 2 Share-based Payments, the CSL Group will be required to recognise an expense for all share-based remuneration issued after 7 November 2002 which has not vested as at 1 January 2005. The expense is based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the grant date.
Share-based Payments
 
Under AASB 112 Income Taxes a new method of accounting for income taxes, known as the "balance sheet liability method", will be adopted, replacing the current "tax effect income statement" approach used by the CSL Group. The new method recognises deferred tax balances in the statement of financial position when there is a difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base. Adoption of this new method may result in increased deferred tax assets and liabilities and, as tax effects follow the underlying transaction, some tax effects will be recognised directly in equity.
Income Taxes

Where government grants are provided for the acquisition or construction of a long-term asset, AASB 120 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance requires the amount of the grant to be recognised as income over the periods necessary to match the grant with the related costs that are intended to be compensated. Under current Australian Accounting Standards, such grants are recognised immediately as revenue.
Government Grants
 
AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is required to be adopted by the CSL Group prospectively from 1 July 2005. This standard requires all financial instruments to be recognised in the statement of financial position and all derivatives and most financial assets to be carried at fair market value. AASB 139 recognises fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting and hedges of investments in foreign operations. Fair value and cash flow hedge accounting can only be considered where documentation, designation and effectiveness tests are met on both a prospective and retrospective basis. Ineffectiveness outside the prescribed range precludes the use of hedge accounting and may result in amounts recognised in the statement of financial performance, which had not been recognised previously.
Hedging and financial Instruments
 
 
The accompanying financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Australia (AGAAP). Certain differences exist between AGAAP and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (USGAAP). The accompanying financial statements could be materially affected by differences between USGAAP and AGAAP in accounting for the following:
 
Goodwill
 
AGAAP requires goodwill to be amortised on a straight line basis over the period of expected benefits, not to exceed 20 years. The carrying value must be reviewed at each reporting date and written down where it is considered that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount ((refer to Note 1(j)). USGAAP requires annual impairment testing with no regular amortization.
 
Income Tax
 
USGAAP requires a "balance sheet" approach to calculating tax effect balances while AGAAP adopts a "profit and loss" approach to income tax accounting (refer to Note 1(c)). Under USGAAP, entities are required to calculate deferred income taxes based on temporary differences, which are the differences between the carrying amount of assets/liabilities for financial statement purposes and their basis for income tax purposes.
 
Employee Stock Options
 
USGAAP requires the cost of issuing employee stock options to be valued using the intrinsic value or fair value option pricing model. This cost is then recognized over the vesting period. AGAAP does not require recognition or measurement of the value of the employee stock options issued, but does require disclosure of such activity in the financial statements.
 
Capitalized Interest
 
Interest cost for qualifying assets during the assets' construction period is capitalized under USGAAP, even if the capital projects in question are not being directly financed. AGAAP only allows the capitalization of interest for capital projects directly financed.

Bill and Hold Sales
 
USGAAP provides stricter requirements than AGAAP with respect to revenue recognition under bill-and-hold arrangements. Under USGAAP, the following conditions must be met for a bill-and-hold transaction to be recorded as a sale:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AGAAP only requires the following conditions be met in order to recognise a bill-and-hold transaction as a sale:
 
 
 
 
If the accompanying financial statements had been prepared in accordance with USGAAP, the financial position and results of operations could be materially different than as accounted for under AGAAP.
 
 
 
JRH Group
Directors' Declaration
 
We, being the CSL Limited Directors, as vendors of the JRH Group of entities, state that:
 
the combined financial statements and associated notes of the JRH Group:
 
(i) presents fairly the Group's financial position as at 30 June 2004 and of the Group's performance for the 12 months ended on that date; and
 
(ii) comply with the Accounting Standards as outlined in Note 1 to the financial statements.
 
 
The Board of Directors of CSL Limited
 
We have audited the accompanying combined statement of financial position of the JRH Group as of June 30, 2004, and the related combined statement of financial performance, and cash flows for the one-year period ended June 30, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the JRH Group at June 30, 2004, and the combined results of its operations and its cash flows for the one-year period ended June 30, 2004, in conformity with Australian generally accepted accounting principles.

Exhibit 99.4
 
 
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the three months ended March 31, 2005 are based on the historical consolidated statements of income of Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (the Company) and the historical consolidated statements of income of JRH Biosciences Pty Ltd., CSL US Inc. and JRH Biosciences Limited, which collectively comprise the JRH Biosciences division (JRH) of CSL Limited, adjusted to give effect to the JRH acquisition and financing of the acquisition that occurred on February 28, 2005.
 
JRH ACQUISITION FINANCING AND PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION
 
On February 23, 2005, the Company entered into a $300.0 million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, including Wells Fargo, National Association, and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, which served as joint lead arrangers. This agreement provided the Company with access to a $150.0 million three-year term loan and five-year $150.0 million revolving credit facility. The interest rates under the facility are based on LIBOR or an alternative base rate. In addition to the February 23, 2005 credit agreement, the Company has a five-year committed facility in the amount of $150.0 million expiring on December 11, 2006.
 
On February 28, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of JRH for approximately $377.7 million in cash including direct acquisition costs, net of cash acquired. The Company funded the acquisition with a combination of existing cash, short-term debt of $190.0 million and three-year term debt of $150.0 million. There are no contingent payments or commitments related to the purchase price of this acquisition.
 
The purchase price of approximately $377.7 million is based on the estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition and has been allocated primarily to the following (in millions): receivables ($14.6); inventory ($124.0); other assets ($9.8); property, plant and equipment ($33.9); intangible assets ($90.5); goodwill ($185.4); accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($40.6); net deferred income tax liabilities ($38.6) and other long-term liabilities ($1.3), based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
 
This allocation reflects the Company's preliminary estimates of the purchase price allocation and is subject to change upon completion of appraisals. Other assets and liabilities may be identified to which a portion of the purchase price could be allocated. The Company has not yet performed a detailed analysis to identify and measure additional adjustments necessary, if any, to conform JRH's accounting policies with the Company's accounting policies.
AUSTRALIAN GAAP TO UNITED STATES GAAP ADJUSTMENTS
 
The historical JRH consolidated statements of income are special purpose financial statement prepared to comply with the Australian accounting standards. The historical consolidated financial statement of JRH in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information are based on JRH's consolidated statements of income after conversion to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and conversion to U.S. dollars. Reference is made to Note 24 to JRH's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 for a discussion of the nature of the significant differences between accounting principles generally accepted in Australia and U.S. GAAP. JRH's consolidated statement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was derived from (i) the unaudited results for the six-month period ended December 31, 2004, and (ii) the unaudited results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004. JRH's consolidated statement for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was derived from the unaudited results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2005.
 
JRH's historical consolidated statement of income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2004 was prepared in Australian dollars. As noted above, the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2004 gives effect to the JRH acquisition and the financing for the JRH acquisition as if each had occurred on January 1, 2004. Accordingly, JRH's historical consolidated statement of income has been converted into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 of (Australian) 1.00=$0.73699, and for the three months ended March 31, 2005 of (Australian) 1.00 =$0.7776.
 
PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income reflect pro forma adjustments that are described in the accompanying notes and are based on available information and certain assumptions the Company believes are reasonable but are subject to change. In the Company's opinion, all adjustments that are necessary to fairly present the pro forma information have been made. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income do not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations would actually have been if the JRH acquisition and the financing for the JRH acquisition had occurred on such dates or to project the Company's results of operations for any future date or period.
 
The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income reflect the Company's preliminary estimates of the allocation of the purchase price for the JRH acquisition and are subject to change. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income do not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost savings that the Company may achieve with respect to the combined entities nor any expense associated with achieving these benefits.
JRH AND SIGMA-ALDRICH CORPORATION HISTORICIAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The historical consolidated statement of income of JRH in the pro forma consolidated statement of income is based on JRH's consolidated financial statements, which have not been audited. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical audited consolidated financial statements, the related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which were included in Sigma-Aldrich Corporation's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements, the related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which were included in Sigma-Aldrich Corporation's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2005, and JRH's historical audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes, included in this Form 8-K/A.
