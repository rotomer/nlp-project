CEO's STATEMENT:
Commenting on first quarter performance and expectations for the year, President and CEO Jai Nagarkatti said: "We are pleased with our strong start across the board in 2006. We exceeded our full year goal and met our Q1 2006 expectations for sales growth and achieved our expected Q1 diluted EPS. This performance gives us confidence that we'll meet our sales and EPS guidance for all of 2006."
Nagarkatti added, "Delivering on each of the five key initiatives in our evolutionary strategic plan contributed to this performance. Achievements on our first initiative, customer centric focus, helped
 
all four of our business units exceed their strategic sales growth targets. While not a contributor to first quarter results, our recent establishment of a wholly owned foreign enterprise (WOFE) and the acquisition of Beijing Superior in China supports two of our five initiatives  expansion in faster growing world economies and the expected profitable reinvestment of cash generated from operations in strategic acquisitions. The carryover benefit from our JRH acquisition added to our first quarter growth and will provide one-third at this year's desired growth contribution from acquisitions. Efforts to build on our Internet superiority, another key initiative, led yet again to increased sales from web-based ordering. And, on our final initiative, process improvement, we continued to effectively manage costs and margins through our successful and disciplined approach."
Nagarkatti continued, stating "This strong start and our continuing progress on all five key initiatives make us confident that we can achieve our top line organic growth target of 7%, add to this growth through additional acquisitions and report diluted EPS of $3.80 to $3.90 from current operations for 2006."
SALES RESULTS (all percentage comparisons are to comparable periods in 2005):
A reconciliation of reported and adjusted sales growth can be found in tabular form in the Supplemental Financial Information section on page 9 of this release.
Reported sales increased 10.8% in the first quarter of 2006. Strong organic growth in core businesses, including a modest contribution from the integrated Proligo acquisition, provided 10.3 percentage points of the increase. Sales gains were driven by improved demand and the success of new sales initiatives in both U.S. and international markets. A carryover benefit from the February 2005 addition of the JRH industrial cell culture business contributed another 4.8 percentage points to the quarterly gain. The impact of currency reduced otherwise reportable growth by 4.3 percentage points. Highlights for our four Business Units  each of which exceeded its strategic growth goal for the quarter  include:
First quarter 2006 sales in all major customer segments and in each major geographic area  the U.S., Europe and other International  maintained the higher levels of growth experienced in the former Scientific Research business (now divided into - commonly used laboratory chemicals and supplies - and - high purity and application driven chemicals - from the second through fourth quarters of 2005. New approaches toward providing innovative solutions for economic buyers produced strong sales for this unit's two major product groups  lab essentials and cell culture  enabling it to achieve sales gains of more than two times its strategic growth goal of 4.0%.
Research Essentials (9.0% organic growth):
Research Essentials
Research Specialties
This unit's growth in major customer segments and geographic markets mirrored that of Organic growth exceeded this unit's 6.0% strategic growth target, helped by a focus on initiatives that take advantage of opportunities in the faster growth areas of drug discovery, material science and specialty biochemicals.
Research Specialties (9.2% organic growth):
Research Essentials.
The integration of Proligo (acquired April 2005) into our existing genomics business contributed to first quarter 2006 organic sales growth. Continuing strength in molecular biology product sales combined with improved demand for synthetic DNA  particularly from academic customers outside the U.S. and pharmaceutical customers worldwide  provided strong organic growth, enabling this unit to again achieve double digit organic growth, consistent with performance over the last three quarters of 2005.
Research Biotech (14.1% organic growth):
 
The completion of one full year of ownership of JRH at the end of February 2006 and the traditionally lumpy nature of this business reduced the acquisition's contribution from approximately 60.0% over the final three quarters of 2005 to 22.3% in Q1 2006. Ongoing efforts to promote this unit's capabilities using the brand identity and the repositioning of its Specialties business as Supply Solutions in February 2006 continued to help drive sales growth at rates far exceeding the underlying market's growth of 2% to 3%. Sales to diagnostics manufacturers were particularly strong in the first quarter of 2006. Booked orders for future delivery, one partial indicator of possible future sales results, also remained strong.
SAFC (Fine Chemicals; 11.4% organic growth):
SAFC
Ongoing efforts to enhance Internet capabilities as we strive to maintain our superiority in this rapidly developing order and information tool boosted E-commerce Research Sales (for and ) to 34% of consolidated Research sales in Q1 2006, up from 32% in Q4 2005. This continued our established pattern of meeting or beating prior quarterly contributions in each of the prior 13 quarters since the Internet became a key part of our sales growth strategy.
Internet:
Research Essentials, Research Specialties
Research Biotech
Efforts to grow international (non-European) sales at a faster pace and boost their overall contribution from 20% of total sales in 2005 to 25% by 2010 led to first quarter international sales increases before currency impacts of 13.0%. Continued emphasis in the developing markets of China, India and Brazil provided currency adjusted sales growth in excess of 30% in each country.

INCOME ANALYSIS:
A reconciliation of proforma to reported net income and diluted earnings per share can be found in tabular form in the Supplemental Financial Information section on page 9 of this release.
Reported diluted EPS for 2006's first quarter was $.98. This included an adverse currency impact of $.04 per share, a non-cash inventory purchase accounting charge of $.03 per share and stock based compensation expense under SFAS 123(R) of $.03 per share. Q1 2006 diluted EPS also included a $.02 per share negative tax impact due largely to the U.S. Congress' unexpected failure to extend existing R&D tax credits in the U.S. Q1 2006 proforma diluted EPS, excluding only the $.03 inventory purchase accounting charge, was $1.01. Reported diluted EPS for 2005's first quarter was $1.07, including $.16 from a non-recurring tax claim settlement benefit and a non-cash inventory purchase accounting charge of $.02, but excluding a $.04 per share impact for stock-based compensation expense which would have been included had the provisions of SFAS 123(R) been applicable to that period. On a proforma basis, first quarter 2006 diluted EPS of $1.01 increased 13.5% over the Q1 2005 diluted EPS of $.89.
Reported operating and pretax income were 23.3% and 22.1% of sales, respectively, for the first quarter of 2006 compared to 22.8% and 22.3% of sales, respectively, for the first quarter of 2005. Gross margins were 51.6% of sales for the first quarter of 2006 compared to 52.0% of sales for the same quarter last year. More than all of this slight decline in gross margin percent resulted from lower gross margins in the JRH industrial cell culture business and inclusion of the non-cash inventory purchase accounting charge (to adjust acquired inventories to their fair market values) for the first two months of 2006's first quarter versus only the final month of 2005's first quarter. These factors were partially offset by favorable impacts from higher unit sales volumes and process improvement benefits in other pre-acquisition businesses. Higher raw material, energy and fuel costs experienced by other chemical businesses had little impact on the 2006 gross margin. First quarter S,G&A expenses declined to 25.4% of sales in 2006 from 26.2% of sales in 2005 due to lower operating expenses as a percent of sales for the JRH industrial cell culture business and process improvement benefits, partially offset by the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense. Increased interest costs from borrowings for last year's acquisitions and both this and last year's share repurchases and higher interest rates reduced pretax margins in Q1 2006 below their Q1 2005 level.
 
The difference in the tax rate of 32.1% for Q1 2006 as compared to 16.3% for Q1 2005 reflects the inclusion of an $11.3 million tax claim settlement benefit in Q1 2005, a lower level of international and other tax benefits in 2006 and the 2006 expiration of R&D tax credits in the U.S. Our initial tax rate guidance of 31.0% for 2006 had anticipated that these R&D credits would be extended, but the tax legislation required to do so has not yet been approved.
OUTLOOK:
We continue to expect organic sales growth for 2006 in line with our previous forecast of 7%. Over the full year, the 4.8% of Q1 2006 reported sales growth from the overhang of the JRH acquisition translates to an additional 1% beyond this 7% organic growth. However, we expect this will be offset by a roughly 1% adverse currency impact if exchange rates remain at March 31, 2006 levels. We continue to believe that the potential exists to add another 2% to our growth from further acquisitions to achieve our targeted 3% acquisition contribution for the full year 2006. Our recently announced expansion in China  which includes establishment of a WOFE, acquisition of our primary distributor and expansion of distribution and administrative facilities  is expected to make a small contribution to this acquisition growth objective, with future acquisitions expected to provide the remainder. Organic growth rates over the remaining quarters of 2006 are expected to vary due to the timing of the Easter holiday in 2006 and 2005 and the natural quarterly fluctuations associated with large orders to meet customers' desired production schedules in our business but are expected to be 7% for the full year. Our focus on becoming a more customer-centric organization, which we believe made a contribution to our strong growth in the first quarter, is expected to continue to enable us to achieve above market growth for the full year. Recent upgrades to our website to make navigation more intuitive and provide quicker search and response times are also expected to support increased sales via the Internet and maintain a leadership position in web-based information and ordering capabilities.
SAFC
Based on first quarter results, currency rates at March 31, 2006 levels, the sales expectations described above and other expectations for our business, management has retained its 2006 reported diluted earnings per share forecast of $3.80 to $3.90. If the R&D tax credit noted above is not reinstated, full year diluted EPS will likely be toward the lower end of that range (and vice versa). This range includes an estimated impact of $.14 to $.16 per share for stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123(R). If the 2005 reported diluted EPS of $3.76 was reduced by a $.14 per diluted share charge for stock-based compensation expense to make both periods comparable, our 2006 EPS increase would range from 5% to 8%. Reported pretax margins in 2006 are expected to be at least 21%, roughly equivalent to that achieved for all of 2005. Cost savings from process improvement efforts, which are expected to be at least $15 million in 2006, will be reinvested to support our ongoing efforts to achieve above market rate sales growth. Modest share repurchase activity may also benefit EPS growth.
OTHER INFORMATION:
Primarily as a result of a higher effective tax rate, our return on equity at March 31, 2006 fell slightly below our 20.0% target to 19.8%. Our ongoing goal remains 20.0%.
Return On Equity:
Another 0.5 million shares were acquired during the first quarter of 2006 at an average price of $64.80 per share. Since beginning the program in late 1999, 38.5 million shares have been acquired at an average purchase price of $37.12 per share. There were 66.9 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2006. The Company expects to continue share repurchases to acquire the remaining 1.5 million authorized shares, but the timing and number of shares purchased, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors.
Share Repurchase:
 
Short-term borrowings were $271.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% and long-term debt was $253.4 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% as of March 31, 2006. The debt to capital ratio at March 31, 2006 was 29.2%.
Working Capital and Debt:
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding at March 31, 2006 was 48 days, matching the record low achieved at both March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2005. Reported inventories were $551.8 million at March 31, 2006 compared to $550.4 million at December 31, 2005, with inventory months on hand of 7.4 months at both March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005.

The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement its GAAP disclosures. The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with the presentation by similar companies in the Company's industry. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
With over 50% of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management uses currency adjusted growth, and believes it is useful to investors, to judge the Company's controllable, local currency performance. While we are able to report currency impacts after the fact, we are unable to estimate changes that may occur later in 2006 to applicable exchange rates and are thus unable to reconcile the projected non-GAAP, currency adjusted internal growth rates to reported GAAP growth rates for the year 2006 as required by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies.
Management also reports both GAAP and adjusted sales and income amounts and comparisons to reflect what it believes is ongoing and/or comparable operating results excluding currency impacts and certain other items, including stock-based compensation expense, the sales benefit from acquisitions and the related inventory purchase accounting charge, and the Q1 2005 tax benefit. Management excludes these other items in judging its historical performance and in assessing its expected future performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
