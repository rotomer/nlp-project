CEO's STATEMENT:
Commenting on second quarter performance and expectations for the year, President and CEO Jai Nagarkatti said: "We are pleased with our sales growth in the first half of 2006 while maintaining operating income margins and enjoying a boost from a favorable tax rate. This performance renews our confidence in meeting our organic sales growth expectations for all of 2006 and enables us to increase our annual diluted EPS guidance to $3.90 to $4.00."
Nagarkatti continued, "Our new customer centric business unit structure is meeting or exceeding both our expectations and those of the many customers with whom I've visited this year. And our fundamental focus remains the same: to be a leader in life science, high technology and service. We continue to make progress on each of the five key growth initiatives in the evolutionary strategic plan we launched roughly a year ago and fully implemented at the beginning of this year, as follows:
 
 
 
 
"Based on results to date, we remain confident that these five growth initiatives will enable us to achieve our targeted organic sales growth of 7% for 2006 and continue our pattern of annual improvements in EPS by beating our previously shared estimates and reporting full year 2006 diluted EPS of $3.90 to $4.00."

SALES RESULTS (all percentage comparisons are to comparable periods in 2005)
A reconciliation of reported and adjusted sales growth and quarterly sales by business unit can be found in tabular form in the Supplemental Financial Information section on page 9 of this release.
Reported sales increased 1.0% in the second quarter of 2006 to a record quarterly level of $448.5 million. The reported sales gain for the first half of 2006 was 5.7%. Organic sales growth for the second quarter and first half of 2006 (excluding currency impacts in both periods and the contribution from JRH's industrial cell culture business in the first half results) was 1.2% and 5.5%, respectively. After reporting exceptionally strong organic growth in the first quarter of 2006 due in part to the relative timing of the Easter holiday and the final quarter of including modest growth from the integrated Proligo acquisition, sales levels in the second quarter improved again to the record level of $448.5 million from $443.1 million in the first quarter of 2006. Sales gains were driven by the success of new sales initiatives. The second quarter additions of our dealer (Beijing Superior) in China and Iropharm made a modest contribution to this growth. Our first half organic sales growth was affected by the Easter holiday at academic customers in the U.S. and Europe and the traditionally lumpy nature of our SAFC business. The impact of currency reduced otherwise reportable growth for the second quarter and first six months by 0.2 and 2.1 percentage points, respectively. Other highlights for our four Business Units include:
Modest growth in all commercial customer segments in the second quarter was offset by a decline in sales to academic accounts. Growth in sales of this unit's key product group, lab essentials, was offset by modest declines in demand for cell culture and analytical reagents. A focus on promoting innovative solutions to economic buyers enabled this unit to slightly exceed its strategic growth goal of 4.0% for the first half of 2006.
Research Essentials (Organic growth-Q2: (0.6%), YTD: 4.2%):
This unit also experienced growth in all commercial customer segments that was only partially offset by declines in sales to academic accounts First half 2006 sales growth was largely in line with this unit's 6.0% organic growth target, with steady contributions from this unit's focus on traditional analytical and chemical synthesis applications helped by initiatives that take advantage of opportunities in the faster growth areas of drug discovery, material science and specialty biochemicals.
Research Specialties (Organic growth-Q2: 2.1%, YTD: 5.7%):
.
 
The benefit provided over the four quarters ending March 31, 2006 from the April 2005 acquisition of Proligo and its integration into our existing synthetic DNA business was reduced as overall sales of synthetic DNA products remained stable with first quarter 2006 levels and pricing for these products declined slightly in response to productivity improvements in this industry. Continued growth in molecular biology product sales contributed to this unit's growth in the second quarter of 2006.
Research Biotech (Organic growth-Q2: 1.4%, YTD: 7.7%):
Q2 2006 sales of $127.3 million represent a new record high for this unit, exceeding the prior record level of $126.4 million achieved in the second quarter of 2005, and a 15% sequential improvement over the $110.7 million of sales achieved in the first quarter of 2006. Demand from pharmaceutical and diagnostic manufacturers in both the U.S. and Europe remained strong. Booked orders for future delivery, one partial indicator of possible future sales results, also reached a new all time high, giving us strong conviction about our ability to achieve targeted organic growth of 10% for all of 2006. After contributing to Q2 2006 growth, the May 2006 addition of Iropharm, a custom chemical synthesis business in Arklow, Ireland, and its immediate integration into the SAFC organization, will also benefit full year 2006 sales growth.
SAFC (Fine Chemicals; Organic growth-Q2: 1.0%, YTD: 5.1%):
Ongoing efforts to enhance Internet capabilities as we strive to maintain our superiority in this rapidly developing order and information tool boosted E-commerce Research Sales (for and ) to 35% of consolidated Research sales in Q2 2006, up from 34% in Q1 2006. This continued our established pattern of meeting or beating prior quarterly contributions in each of the prior 14 quarters since the Internet became a key part of our sales growth strategy.

Efforts to grow international (non-European) sales at a faster pace and boost their overall contribution from 20% of total sales in 2005 to 25% by 2010 led to second quarter international sales increases before currency impacts of 10.0%. Continued emphasis in the developing markets of China, India and Brazil provided currency adjusted sales growth of at least 30% in each country.

INCOME ANALYSIS:
A reconciliation of proforma to reported net income and diluted earnings per share can be found in tabular form in the Supplemental Financial Information section on page 10 of this release.
Reported diluted EPS for 2006's second quarter was $1.04. This includes a $.06 Q2 2006 tax benefit, not reflected in prior EPS guidance for a 31-32% effective tax rate for 2006. This tax rate improvement resulted from a reduction in tax liabilities related to tax audit activity and favorable worldwide tax benefits and geographic income mix that lowered the effective tax rate from 32.1% in 2006's first quarter to 27.6% in Q2 2006. Stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123(R) reduced otherwise reportable diluted Q2 2006 EPS by $.05 per share. Reported diluted EPS for 2005's second quarter was $.91, including an inventory purchase accounting charge of $.05, but excluding a $.03 per share impact for stock-based compensation expense which would have been included had the provisions of SFAS 123(R) been applicable to that period. On a proforma basis, second quarter 2006 diluted EPS of $1.04 increased 11.8% over the Q2 2005 proforma diluted EPS of $.93.
Reported operating income was 23.1% and 23.2% of sales, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2006 compared to 20.9% and 21.8% of sales for the same two respective periods of 2005. Gross margins were 52.3% and 52.0% of sales, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2006 compared to 50.2% and 51.0% of sales for the same two respective periods of 2005. The improved gross margin in both the second quarter and first half of 2006 compared to the comparable periods in 2005 relates to the inclusion of the inventory purchase accounting charge (to adjust acquired inventories to their fair market values) for the first two months of 2006 versus the final four months of 2005's first half, as well as to favorable product mix in 2006. Higher raw material, energy and fuel costs experienced by other chemical businesses had little impact on the 2006 gross margins. After showing modest improvement relative to sales in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 2005's first quarter, second quarter S,G&A expenses rose to 26.2% of sales in 2006, roughly equivalent to the level for the second quarter 2005, as the increase from stock-based compensation expense was augmented by adding 15 employees to our sales effort in the second quarter. The net benefit of all of these changes was more than sufficient to offset the impact of increased interest costs from borrowings for both this and last year's acquisitions and share repurchases and higher interest rates to produce pretax margins of 21.6% and 21.9% of sales, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2006 compared to 19.8% and 21.0% for the respective periods of 2005.
 
OUTLOOK:
We continue to expect organic sales growth for 2006 in line with our previous forecast of 7%. The Q2 2006 acquisitions of Beijing Superior, the Company's primary distributor in China, and of Iropharm, a custom chemical synthesis business located in Ireland, are expected to make modest contributions to this internal growth. Due to the combination of previously reported export sales into our expanded operation in China and the full integration of the acquired Iropharm manufacturing unit into our SAFC production network, the modest benefits from these additions are not easily segregated and will not be separately reported. The first quarter benefit from the overhang of the JRH acquisition translates to an additional 1% beyond this 7% organic growth. Ongoing efforts to pursue other desirable acquisition candidates may further enhance internal growth in 2006 and 2007 as we seek to achieve our targeted 3% annual acquisition contribution.
Based on first half results, expectations for a more favorable tax rate for the remainder of 2006, currency rates at June 30, 2006 levels, the sales expectations described above and other expectations for our business, management has increased its 2006 reported diluted earnings per share forecast to $3.90 to $4.00, a $.10 improvement. This assumes a tax rate for the combined final two quarters of 2006 in the 29-30% range, with variations in the quarterly tax rate likely. If the U.S. R&D tax credit were reinstated, the second half tax rate would likely be toward the lower end of that range and provide a modest positive benefit to otherwise reportable diluted EPS. This diluted EPS range includes an estimated impact of about $.16 per share for stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123(R). If the 2005 reported diluted EPS of $3.76 was reduced by a $.14 per diluted share charge for stock-based compensation expense to make both periods comparable, our 2006 EPS increase would range from 8% to 10%. Reported pretax margins for the full year 2006 are expected to be at least 21%, roughly equivalent to that achieved for all of 2005. Cost savings from process improvement efforts, which are expected to be at least $15 million in 2006, will be reinvested to support our ongoing efforts to achieve above market rate sales growth. Modest share repurchase activity may also benefit EPS growth.
OTHER INFORMATION:
Our return on equity at June 30, 2006 was 20.6%, slightly exceeding our long-term goal of 20.0%.
Return On Equity:
Another 0.8 million shares were acquired during the second quarter of 2006 at an average price of $69.23 per share. Since beginning the program in late 1999, 39.3 million shares have been acquired at an average purchase price of $37.76 per share. There were 66.4 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2006. The Company expects to continue share repurchases to acquire the remaining 0.7 million authorized shares, but the timing and number of shares purchased, if any, will depend upon market conditions and other factors.
Share Repurchase:
 
Cash flow from operations in the first half of 2006 compared to the first half of 2005 increased by $8.9 million to $134.3 million. Capital expenditures of $30.8 million for the first half of 2006 were $20.1 million less than that for the first half of 2005.
Cash Flow, Working Capital and Debt:
Short-term borrowings were $334.7 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.9% and long-term debt was $255.6 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% as of June 30, 2006. The debt to capital ratio at June 30, 2006 was 30.7%.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding at June 30, 2006 was 49 days, equivalent to the June 30, 2005 level and one day above the record low of 48 days achieved at both March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2005. Reported inventories were $585.6 million at June 30, 2006 compared to $550.4 million at December 31, 2005, with inventory months on hand increased to 7.8 months at June 30, 2006 from 7.4 months at December 31, 2005 as currency exchange rates boosted reported carrying values, modest increases in stocks at major U.S. distribution locations were made to improve on-time service deliveries and a modest amount of inventory was added with the Iropharm acquisition.

The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement its GAAP disclosures. The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with the presentation by similar companies in the Company's industry. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
With over 50% of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management uses currency adjusted growth, and believes it is useful to investors, to judge the Company's controllable, local currency performance. While we are able to report currency impacts after the fact, we are unable to estimate changes that may occur later in 2006 to applicable exchange rates and are thus unable to reconcile the projected non-GAAP, currency adjusted internal growth rates to reported GAAP growth rates for the year 2006 as required by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies.
Management also reports both GAAP and adjusted sales and income amounts and comparisons to reflect what it believes is ongoing and/or comparable operating results excluding currency impacts and certain other items, including stock-based compensation expense, the sales benefit from acquisitions and the related inventory purchase accounting charge, and the Q1 2005 tax benefit. Management excludes these other items in judging its historical performance and in assessing its expected future performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
