Adoption of 2009 Bonus Plan
On February 9, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sigma-Aldrich (the Company), approved targets for the cash incentive bonus program (i.e., bonus) to eligible members of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2009. The table below lists the 2009 target bonus awards as a percent of base salaries for the Company's named executive officers:
 
Financial and operational performance targets for the annual cash bonus are linked directly to the annual business plan for the overall Company and the business units, where applicable. For 2009, performance goals established by the Committee include:
 
 
 
 
The Committee has established specific performance targets for 2009 for each goal listed above that will be appropriately challenging and consistent with achieving the Company's long-term growth and profitability objectives to grow sales on average 10% and provide a return on equity of 20% over the long term. Specific objectives for any particular time period are considered competitively sensitive in that they may reveal tactical marketing, sales and operations initiatives that may put the Company at a disadvantage in the marketplace if they were to be disclosed.
The Company will provide additional information regarding the compensation of its named executive officers in its proxy statement for the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will be issued in March 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
