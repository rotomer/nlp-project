CEO's STATEMENT:
Commenting on second quarter 2010 performance, Chairman, President and CEO Jai Nagarkatti said: "Our earnings for the second quarter of 2010 continued the strong performance achieved in this year's first quarter. We are very pleased with this performance that drove our increase in diluted EPS for the first half of 2010 to 18%. Consistent with our first quarter 2010 experience, conditions were favorable in several of our markets. Our sales growth in SAFC and in our research focus initiative areas of analytical, biology and materials science all made positive contributions to our overall growth.
Each of our Research business units had organic sales growth in 2010's second quarter that was equivalent to or exceeded results in this year's first quarter driven by improved organic growth in European and other international markets. And our SAFC business continued its strong sales performance with a double digit percentage organic sales increase in 2010's second quarter from continued strong growth of Hitech materials to the L.E.D. and semiconductor industries and improved growth in its sales of industrial media for biological drugs."
 
Nagarkatti continued, "We've reaffirmed our organic sales growth expectation for 2010 of mid-single digit percentage growth and continue to believe that our diluted adjusted EPS for 2010 will be in our previously communicated range of $3.05 to $3.20. We expect stronger growth in SAFC sales and have identified operating improvements that are expected to largely offset a headwind from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And we've continued our efforts to improve our long-term growth and returns, seeking to boost our organic sales growth to 7% to 8% and drive operating profit margins to 26% to 27% over the next five years."
2010 RESULTS:
Reported sales for the second quarter of 2010 were $554 million, an increase of 6% from the second quarter of 2009. Excluding a 1% impact from unfavorable currency rates, second quarter organic sales growth was 7%, improving on the first quarter organic sales growth of 4%. This gain over the comparable period of 2009 and the improvement over the first quarter 2010 organic sales growth rate were driven largely by unit volume growth in our Research businesses and continued improvement in market conditions for fine chemicals. Sales for the Company's Research business grew 5% on both a reported and currency adjusted basis for the second quarter of 2010. Sales for SAFC continued the momentum that began in the second half of 2009 and continued through the first half of 2010, with second quarter reported growth of 10% and organic growth of 11% as sales of our Supply Solutions, Bioscience and Hitech products reflected stronger demand. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted organic sales is on page 7.
The operating income margin in the second quarter of 2010 of 25.6% of sales reflects a 170 basis point improvement from 2009's second quarter due to continued benefits from higher volumes, currency benefits, favorable product mix and effective management of S,G&A costs. These items were partially offset by $3 million of pretax restructuring costs to consolidate certain manufacturing facilities as was previously announced. These restructuring actions are in line with the Company's efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower the fixed cost structure as part of its longer term goal to improve operating margins to a 26% to 27% range. Supply chain process improvements provided $5 million of the Q2 2010 pretax enhancement.
Free cash flow (defined on page 6) for the first half of 2010 was $210 million, an increase of $51 million compared to the same period in 2009. Higher net income and lower capital expenditures were the primary contributors to this increase. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is on page 8.
Other highlights from global sales growth initiatives and profit enhancement activities include:

OTHER INFORMATION
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $247 million compared to $215 million for 2009's first half. This increase reflects the higher net income and a lower level of capital expenditures for the first six months of $37 million in 2010 compared to $56 million in 2009. Management continued its activities to reduce cash required for inventory, with inventory levels reduced to 6.0 months at June 30, 2010 from 6.5 months at December 31, 2009. Overall free cash flow of $210 million for the first half of 2010 was used to repay $34 million in debt and return $95 million to shareholders through share repurchases and a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. The Company's debt to capital ratio was reduced to 24% at June 30, 2010 from 26% at December 31, 2009.
Cash Flow and Debt:
Another 0.4 million shares were acquired in the second quarter of 2010 at an average share price of $59.04. There were 121 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2010. The Company expects to continue to offset the dilutive impact of issuing share based incentive compensation with future repurchases. Further, the Company may repurchase additional shares, but the timing and amount will depend upon market conditions and other factors.

The Company supplements its disclosures made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") with certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with the presentation by similar companies in the Company's industry. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. See the Supplemental Financial Information on pages 7 and 8 for these reconciliations.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
With over 60% of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management uses currency adjusted growth, and believes it is useful to investors, to judge the Company's local currency performance. Organic sales growth data presented in this release excludes currency impacts. While we are able to report currency impacts after the fact, we are unable to estimate changes that may occur later in 2010 to applicable exchange rates. Any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies.
Management also uses proforma net income (reconciled on page 8) and free cash flow (defined on page 6), non-GAAP measures, to judge its performance and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Due to the uncertain timing of future restructuring charges, we are unable to include these charges in the 2010 diluted EPS forecast. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
