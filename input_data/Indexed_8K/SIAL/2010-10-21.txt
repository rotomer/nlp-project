CEO's STATEMENT:
Commenting on third quarter 2010 performance, Chairman, President and CEO Jai Nagarkatti said: "Our earnings for the third quarter of 2010 continued the strong performance achieved in the earlier quarters of 2010, driving our adjusted diluted EPS for the first nine months of the year up by 20% over the comparable prior year level. Our third quarter sales growth for SAFC again improved over prior 2010 quarterly gains. Each of our research initiatives in analytical, biology and materials science products also made a positive contribution to our sales growth.
Our SAFC business continued its strong quarterly sales performance with another double digit percentage organic sales increase in 2010's third quarter, with continued strong growth of materials and precursors for semi-conductor and L.E.D. applications, industrial cell culture media for biological
 
drugs and improved growth in the sale of bulk chemical products for development and manufacturing. Each of our Research business units had organic sales growth in 2010's third quarter that was largely equivalent to or exceeded results in this year's first half driven in part by continued strength in non-European international markets."
Nagarkatti continued, "We've increased our adjusted diluted EPS for 2010 to a new range of $3.20 to $3.28, fully expecting to deliver another record year of earnings in 2010. We reaffirm our mid-single digit percentage organic sales growth expectation for the full year of 2010. We expect to deliver improved profit margins driven by our sales expectation, ability to effectively manage costs and a weaker than anticipated U. S. dollar."
2010 RESULTS:
Reported sales for the third quarter of 2010 were $563 million, an increase of 5% from the third quarter of 2009. Excluding a 2% impact from unfavorable currency rates, third quarter organic sales growth was 7%, consistent with the organic sales growth achieved in 2010's second quarter and above the first quarter organic sales growth of 4%. Sales for the Company's Research business grew 5% on a currency adjusted basis for the third quarter of 2010, driven primarily by volume growth in each of the three geographic regions. Third quarter sales for the Company's SAFC business grew 14% on a currency adjusted basis, with sales growth improving over the prior quarters of the year as sales of our Supply Solutions, Bioscience and Hitech products again reflected stronger demand. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted (organic) sales is on page 8.
The operating income margin in the third quarter of 2010 was 23.4% of sales. Excluding restructuring and impairment costs, the operating income margin in the third quarter of 2010 would have been 25.4%, an increase of 260 basis from 2009's third quarter. Gross margin of 52.9% was up 330 basis points due to our ability to enhance margins from higher sales volumes, currency benefits and favorable product mix. This improvement was partially offset by higher S,G&A costs, primarily from variable incentive compensation costs related to the improved financial performance. The pretax restructuring costs of $4 million related to the previously announced consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Europe. These restructuring actions reflect the Company's efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower the fixed cost structure as part of its longer term goal to improve operating margins to a 26% to 27% range. The pretax impairment cost of $7 million related to the reduction in the value of a long-term investment.
Free cash flow (defined on page 7) for the first nine months of 2010 was $332 million, an increase of $58 million compared to the same period in 2009. Higher net income and lower capital expenditures were the primary contributors to this increase. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is on page 9.
Other highlights from global sales growth initiatives and profit enhancement activities include:

OTHER INFORMATION:
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $397 million compared to $362 million for the comparable period of 2009. This increase is largely due to higher net income. Capital expenditures for the first nine months were $65 million in 2010 compared to $88 million in 2009. Inventory levels were 6.3 months at September 30, 2010 compared to 6.5 months at December 31, 2009. Overall free cash flow of $332 million for the first nine months of 2010 was used to repay $100 million in debt and return $134 million to shareholders through share repurchases and a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. The Company's debt to capital ratio was reduced to 20% at September 30, 2010 from 26% at December 31, 2009.
Cash Flow and Debt:
Another 0.3 million shares were acquired in the third quarter of 2010 at an average share price of $57.05. There were 121 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2010. The Company expects to continue to offset the dilutive impact of issuing share based incentive compensation with future repurchases. The Company may repurchase additional shares, but the timing and amount will depend upon market conditions and other factors.

The Company supplements its disclosures made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") with certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with the presentation by similar companies in the Company's industry. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. See the Supplemental Financial Information on pages 8 and 9 for these reconciliations.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
With over 60% of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management uses currency adjusted growth, and believes it is useful to investors, to judge the Company's local currency performance. Organic sales growth data presented in this release excludes currency impacts. The Company calculates the impact of changes in foreign currency rates by multiplying current period activity by the difference between current period exchange rates and prior period exchange rates, the result is the defined impact of "changes in foreign currency exchange rates". While we are able to report currency impacts after the fact, we are unable to estimate changes that may occur later in 2010 to applicable exchange rates. Any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies.
 
Management also uses adjusted net income (reconciled on page 9) and free cash flow (defined on page 7), non-GAAP measures, to judge its performance and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Due to the uncertain timing of future restructuring charges, we are unable to include these charges in the 2010 diluted EPS forecast. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
