CEO's STATEMENT
:
Commenting on second quarter 2012 performance, President and CEO Rakesh Sachdev said, We delivered another solid quarter of sales and EPS growth. We generated $664 million of sales in second quarter 2012, which represented 3% organic sales growth. We achieved growth in all geographic regions. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates since our last earnings call reduced otherwise reportable second quarter 2012 sales and adjusted EPS by $11 million and $0.01, respectively.
Second quarter 2012 SAFC sales were $223 million, a new quarterly record. We generated better than expected SAFC organic sales growth of 8%. We were pleased by the improved performance of our SAFC custom pharma business, which saw solid growth in cGMP manufactured products in second quarter 2012. Our new Taiwan facility has increased Hitech production capacity for the LED market, and orders continue to ramp-up nicely. Based on the solid first half of 2012 results and visibility for accelerated sales growth, we are reaffirming our guidance for low double digit organic growth for SAFC sales in the second half of 2012.
Second quarter 2012 Research sales were $441 million. Research sales grew organically 1%, which was at the low end of our expectation. Asia Pacific and Latin American sales growth remained solid, and organic sales growth from academic customers remained in the low single digits. Slowdowns in the U.S. and Europe, especially with some of our pharmaceutical customers, reduced organic sales growth in Research from first quarter 2012. We believe it is prudent to assume that uncertainties in the market will continue for the remainder of 2012. As a result, we are tempering our second half of 2012 outlook for Research to low single digit organic sales growth as compared with our prior outlook of low-to-mid single digits. Given this outlook, we are implementing additional cost controls, while remaining fully committed to the long-term growth initiatives that we outlined at our business review in March.
Sachdev concluded, We expect full year 2012 organic sales growth to be in the low-to-mid single digits as compared to our prior expectation of mid-single digits. Our updated 2012 adjusted EPS guidance range is $3.80 to $3.90, a $0.10 to $0.15 reduction from prior guidance range of $3.90 to $4.05. This reduction is driven by more unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates since our prior guidance. As macroeconomic conditions have impacted Research sales expectations, we have implemented additional cost controls and restructuring efforts. The cost savings from these activities are expected to offset the negative EPS impact from expected lower Research sales. We believe that our broad and expanding consumables portfolio in Research, the success of our customer-oriented solutions approach in SAFC, our growth in emerging markets, synergies expected from our recent acquisitions and our continued strong margins and cash flow have enabled us to deliver solid first half of 2012 results and will serve us well in the second half of 2012 and beyond. Our management team remains fully engaged and committed to delivering a solid second half performance.

2012 RESULTS
:
Reported second quarter 2012 sales were $664 million and increased 4% over second quarter 2011. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which reduced otherwise reportable sales by 5%, and acquisitions, which increased sales by 6%, second quarter 2012 organic sales growth was 3%. Second quarter 2012 SAFC sales grew organically by 8% over second quarter 2011, led by strong demand in custom pharma and Hitech. Hitech sales increased with the opening of a new plant in Taiwan, and sales are expected to accelerate in the second half of 2012. Second quarter 2012 Research sales grew organically by 1% over second quarter 2011, led by double digit organic growth in Analytical product sales to applied markets. Biology sales were organically flat, and Chemistry sales declined organically mid-single digits, largely driven by weakness in pharma demand. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted (organic) sales can be found on page 10.
The adjusted operating income margin in second quarter 2012 was 25.8% of sales compared to 25.4% of sales in second quarter 2011. Second quarter 2012 adjusted operating income excludes $4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of restructuring costs.
Reported and adjusted operating income includes amortization of acquisition related intangibles of $8 million, or $0.05 earnings per diluted share, in second quarter 2012 compared to $3 million, or $0.02 earnings per diluted share, in second quarter 2011. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted operating income and margin is provided on page 11.
The effective tax rate for second quarter 2012 was 31% compared to 29% in second quarter 2011. The higher effective tax rate for second quarter 2012 when compared to second quarter 2011 is primarily attributable to higher benefits realized in 2011 from favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for full year 2012 is expected to be approximately 30% to 31% of pretax income.
Free cash flow (defined on page 11) for the first half of 2012 was $168 million compared to $210 in the first half of 2011. Free cash flow in 2012 is lower than 2011 due primarily to the timing of vendor payments, as well as greater capital spending related to new facilities. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is provided on page 11.

OTHER INFORMATION
:
Cash Flow and Debt
:
Net cash provided by operating activities for the first half of 2012 was $226 million compared to $254 million for the first half of 2011. First half of 2012 free cash flow is lower than the same period in 2011 due primarily to the timing of vendor payments made to fund ongoing operations. Capital expenditures were $58 million in the first half of 2012 compared to $44 million in the first half of 2011. Free cash flow of $168 million, net debt issuances of $227 million and the partial use of cash on hand for the first half of 2012 were used to return $99 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and fund acquisitions of $389 million. The Company's debt to capital ratio was 24% at June 30, 2012 and 19% at December 31, 2011.
Share Repurchases
:
In second quarter 2012, the Company repurchased 0.3 million shares at an average share price of $71.10. There were 121 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2012. The Company expects to continue to offset the dilutive impact of issuing share based incentive compensation with future repurchases, the timing and amount of which will depend upon market conditions and other factors.
Board of Directors Declare Quarterly Cash Dividend
:
At a Board of Directors meeting held June 26, 2012, the Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend is payable on September 14, 2012 to shareholders of record on August 31, 2012.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
:
The Company supplements its disclosures made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with the presentation by other companies inside or outside of the Company's industry. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. See the Supplemental Financial Information on pages 10 and 11 for these reconciliations.
With over 60% of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management uses currency adjusted sales growth when analyzing Company performance, and believes it is useful as well to investors to judge the Company's performance. Organic sales growth data presented in this release excludes currency and acquisitions impacts. The Company calculates the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by multiplying current period activity by the difference between current period exchange rates and prior period exchange rates. The result is the defined impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While we are able to report past currency impacts, we are unable to estimate changes that may occur later in 2012 to applicable exchange rates. Any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on reported growth rates due to the volume of sales denominated in foreign currencies.
Management also uses the following non-GAAP measures to judge its performance and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value: adjusted net income and EPS; adjusted operating income margin (reconciled on page 11); and free cash flow (defined on page 11). Due to the uncertain timing of future restructuring and other special charges we are unable to include these charges in the 2012 diluted adjusted EPS forecast or provide reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
