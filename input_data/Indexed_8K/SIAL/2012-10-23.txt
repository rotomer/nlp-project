CEO's STATEMENT
:
Commenting on third quarter 2012 performance, President and CEO Rakesh Sachdev said, We were able to deliver $0.94 adjusted EPS, which includes an $0.11 EPS headwind for unfavorable year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates, while generating 2% overall organic sales growth.
While we continue to experience soft demand in our Research business, our end markets have remained relatively stable from second quarter levels. We believe our recent initiatives, including new product launches and expansion in emerging markets, have set us up for improved performance in the coming quarters.
SAFC sales were below our expectations, and a reminder that this business can fluctuate quarter to quarter. Third quarter results were impacted by the timing of a few large orders, including a large industrial cell culture media order, which slipped into the fourth quarter. Despite strong double-digit volume growth of our LED chemical precursors from our new Taiwan Hitech facility, market pricing declined more than expected. Additionally, some of our LED customers made late-quarter changes to orders as they adjusted inventory levels. We were able to mitigate some of the margin impact arising from price declines through reduced raw material prices and enhanced efficiencies.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in organic sales growth for SAFC. We remain positive on the end market dynamics in our Bioscience and Custom Pharma businesses. In Hitech, we expect to deliver higher sequential volume growth, despite inventory management by a few of our customers.
Sachdev concluded, We continue to monitor end market dynamics and are confident in our ability to enact further cost reduction actions, if necessary. Other than increased Hitech pricing and demand fluctuations, our end markets have generally remained stable since the second quarter. We were very pleased with our cash flow generation in the third quarter. We reaffirm our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.80 to $3.90 and free cash flow guidance of more than $400 million. We remain fully committed to our strategic initiatives to support future growth and remain positive on the foundation that we have been building for growth in 2013 and beyond.
Q3 2012 RESULTS
:
Reported third quarter 2012 sales were $639 million and increased 2% over third quarter 2011. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which reduced otherwise reportable sales by 6%, and acquisitions, which increased sales by 6%, third quarter 2012 organic sales growth was 2%.
Third quarter Research organic sales growth was 1%, led by strong sales of Analytical products offset by a decline in sales of Chemistry products as a result of continued Pharma consolidation.
Third quarter SAFC organic sales growth was 5%, led by double-digit growth in the Custom Pharma manufacturing business, offset by timing issues in Bioscience and late-quarter order adjustments and pricing declines in Hitech. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted (organic) sales for the Company can be found on page 10.

Adjusted operating income margin in third quarter 2012 was 25.0% of sales compared to 26.0% of sales in third quarter 2011. Adjusted operating income excludes restructuring costs in both periods.
Excluding the impact of year-over-year foreign exchange rate changes and incremental amortization expense related to new acquisitions, adjusted third quarter 2012 operating margin would have been 27.5%, an improvement of 150 basis points from the third quarter 2011. Reported and adjusted operating income includes amortization of acquisition related intangibles of $7 million, or $0.04 earnings per diluted share, in third quarter 2012 compared to $3 million, or $0.02 earnings per diluted share, in third quarter 2011. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted operating income and margin is provided on page 11.
The effective tax rate for third quarter 2012 was 27.7% compared to 25.9% in third quarter 2011 and was 30.1% for the first nine months of 2012 compared to 27.4% for the same period in 2011. The effective tax rate for full year 2012 is now expected to be approximately 30%.
Free cash flow (defined on page 9) for the first nine months of 2012 was $290 million compared to $300 million in the same time period of 2011. Free cash flow in 2012 is lower than 2011 due primarily to greater capital spending related to new facilities. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is provided on page 11.

OTHER INFORMATION
:
Cash Flow and Debt
:
Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2012 was $379 million compared to $373 million for the same period of 2011. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to $73 million in the same period of 2011. Free cash flow of $290 million, net debt issuances of $152 million and the partial use of cash on hand for the first nine months of 2012 were used to fund acquisitions of $389 million and return $172 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The Company's debt to capital ratio was 22% at September 30, 2012 and 19% at December 31, 2011.
Share Repurchases
:
In third quarter 2012, the Company repurchased 0.7 million shares for $49 million. There were 120 million basic shares outstanding at September 30, 2012. The Company expects to continue to offset the dilutive impact of issuing share based incentive compensation with future repurchases, the timing and amount of which will depend upon market conditions and other factors.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
:
The Company supplements its disclosures made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with measures presented by other companies inside or outside of the Company's industry. Whenever the Company uses non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. See the Supplemental Financial Information on pages 10 and 11 for these reconciliations.
With over 60% of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management uses currency adjusted sales growth when analyzing Company performance, and believes it is useful as well to investors to judge the Company's performance. Organic sales growth data presented in this release excludes currency and acquisitions impacts. The Company calculates the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by multiplying current period activity by the difference between current period exchange rates and prior period exchange rates. The result is the defined impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While we are able to report past currency impacts, we are unable to estimate changes that may occur later in 2012 to applicable exchange rates. Any significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on reported growth rates due to the volume of sales denominated in foreign currencies.

Management also uses the following non-GAAP measures to judge its performance and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value: adjusted net income and EPS; adjusted operating income margin (reconciled on page 11); and free cash flow (defined on page 9). Due to the uncertain timing of future restructuring and other special charges we are unable to include these charges in the 2012 diluted adjusted EPS forecast or provide reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
