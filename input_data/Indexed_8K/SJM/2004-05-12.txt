Exhibit 99.1 The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Sale of Henry Jones Foods to SPC Ardmona Ltd. ORRVILLE, Ohio, May 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- In support of its strategic focus on North America, The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced it has entered into an agreement to sell its Australian subsidiary, Henry Jones Foods, Pty. Ltd. to SPC Ardmona Ltd. (ASX: SPC.AX) in an all cash transaction. The transaction is expected to close by the end of June 2004. Henry Jones Foods, acquired by the Company in 1989, is a leading Australian manufacturer and marketer of fruit spreads, fruit snacks, specialty sauces, and marinades sold primarily under the IXL, Allowrie and Taylor's brand names. While the business is a very attractive asset with a rich tradition in the Australian food industry, it does not fit with the Company's current stated strategy of owning and marketing North American icon brands. The transaction is expected to generate net proceeds of approximately $37 million and result in a net gain of approximately $12 million or $0.15 per share. The Company estimates that Henry Jones Foods contributed approximately $36 million in sales and $0.04 per share to fiscal year 2004 results, which will be announced by the Company in June. Results of Henry Jones Foods' operations have historically been included in the international business area of the Company's Special Markets segment. The Company also announced a restructuring of its international operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, Smucker decided to exit a contract packaging arrangement and certain segments of its retail business in Europe and the U.K., which currently generates annual sales of approximately $3 million. The Company stated that it would continue to manufacture industrial fruit products at its facility located in Scotland. As a result of this decision to streamline operations, the Company expects to report restructuring charges of approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. About The J. M.
