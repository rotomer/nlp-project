Exhibit 99.1 The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Record First Quarter Results - Significant Increase in Sales and Earnings Due to Acquisition of Multifoods - Integration of Multifoods' Operations on Track - Board of Directors Authorizes Share Repurchase - Company Confirms Fiscal Year 2005 Outlook ORRVILLE, Ohio, Aug. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2004, of its 2005 fiscal year. Results for the quarter include the operations of International Multifoods Corporation (Multifoods) since the acquisition closing date of June 18, 2004. As previously announced, the Company sold its Australian based Henry Jones Foods (HJF) business and is planning to divest the U.S. foodservice business acquired as part of the Multifoods transaction. Results for both of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations and all prior periods have been restated. Quarterly restated results for fiscal year 2004 are included. First Quarter Results Company sales were $415.8 million for the first quarter of 2005, up 22 percent compared to $341.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. The acquired Multifoods' businesses contributed $75.5 million to sales in the first quarter of 2005. Excluding the contribution of the Multifoods' brands, higher sales of branded products were offset by declines in non-branded industrial sales. Income from continuing operations was $27.5 million, an increase of nine percent over $25.2 million in last year's first quarter, while earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.50 in both years, due to the additional shares issued in the Multifoods transaction. Improved margins on the Company's existing business and the addition of Multifoods were the primary causes for the earnings increase. These increases were partially offset by higher interest expense, associated with debt related to the acquisition. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $2.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $3.0 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2004 included restructuring charges of $3.2 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these merger and integration and restructuring costs, the Company's income from continuing operations was up 14 percent and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.57 and $0.54, in the first quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. "We closed the acquisition of Multifoods this quarter and are pleased to see its contribution reflected in our first quarter results. With the addition of Multifoods, we have added an impressive array of leading, North American icon brands to the family of Smucker," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We have already started to invest behind these brands and the integration of the businesses is well underway." Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was up 27 percent to $32.8 million or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to last year's first quarter net income of $25.8 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's net income was income from discontinued operations of $5.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share, which includes the gain on the Company's sale of its HJF business. Income from discontinued operations was $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share last year. The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. Scottsville Plant During the first quarter of 2005, construction of the Smucker's Uncrustables(R) plant in Scottsville, Kentucky, was completed and the plant commenced operations. The new facility has experienced a longer ramp-up schedule than originally anticipated. The Company incurred approximately $2.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share in costs associated with the start-up during the first quarter of 2005. These costs consist primarily of additional labor, materials, and under-absorbed overhead. The Company expects to incur additional start-up costs for the year, with a majority of the costs to be incurred during the second quarter. The Company plans to offset these costs with cost reductions across the organization, and is not changing its fiscal year earnings guidance. "We view this ramp-up issue as a short-term hurdle and continue to be excited about Uncrustables as a growth platform for the Company over the next several years," commented Richard Smucker, president, co-chief executive officer and chief financial officer. "We continue to support Uncrustables with additional promotion and marketing activities this year and anticipate a significant year-over-year sales increase." Margins Operating income in the first quarter increased 16 percent from the comparable quarter last year, while operating margin decreased from 12.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004 to 11.6 percent in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in operating income was attributed to the overall revenue growth. The Company's gross margin increased slightly from 34.6 percent in the first quarter of last year to 34.8 percent in the first quarter of this year, due primarily to the impact of the Company's supply chain optimization project, favorable manufacturing costs, and a decrease in restructuring charges. The Company continues to see escalating raw material costs. Increases in the cost of certain fruit varieties and rising fuel costs, which primarily affect packaging components as well as energy costs, are the key contributors. The Company expects to offset these increases in raw material costs over the remainder of the year through a variety of cost reduction and pricing measures. Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses as a percentage of sales declined slightly from 22.0 percent in the first quarter of 2004 to 21.9 percent in the current quarter. Marketing and selling expenses decreased as a percent of sales despite an absolute dollar increase of 11 percent. This was somewhat offset by administrative costs being incurred at the former Multifoods' headquarters in Minnesota, which is expected to be closed by the end of April 2005. Interest expense increased from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2004 to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of an increase in the Company's debt outstanding associated with the acquisition of Multifoods. The Company's first quarter earnings benefited from a decrease in the effective tax rate from 37.5 percent in 2004 to 36.6 percent this quarter. Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market The U.S. retail market segment is comprised of the Company's consumer and consumer oils and baking business areas. Prior to the acquisition of Multifoods, this segment represented the domestic sales of Smucker's(R), Jif(R), and Crisco(R) branded products to retail customers. With the addition of Multifoods, domestic sales of Pillsbury(R), Hungry Jack(R), Martha White(R), and Pet(R) branded products to retail customers are now included in this segment. Sales in the U.S. retail market segment for the first quarter of 2005 were $288.1 million, compared to $248.3 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 16 percent. The Multifoods' brands contributed $39.9 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. During the first quarter of 2005, sales in the consumer area increased 11 percent over the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in the Smucker's and Jif brands, the addition of Hungry Jack, and continued growth of the Company's Uncrustables products. In the consumer oils and baking area, sales were up 29 percent due to the addition of the Pillsbury and Martha White brands. Crisco branded sales in retail were down approximately six percent during the quarter, an improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, non-branded industrial oil sales were down from the prior year. Special Markets The special markets segment is comprised of the international, foodservice, beverage, industrial, and Canada strategic business areas. The Canadian business acquired from Multifoods has been combined with the Company's previous Canadian business to form the new Canada business area. Sales in the special markets segment were $127.7 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $93.6 million for the first quarter of 2004. Multifoods contributed $35.6 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. Sales in the Canada and foodservice business areas were up over the prior year's first quarter. Excluding the Multifoods sales and planned declines in the industrial and international businesses, special markets increased four percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the comparable period last year. Foodservice sales, which exclude the Multifoods' U.S. foodservice business, were up four percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared to last year's first quarter. Growth in the Company's traditional portion control business and increased Uncrustables sales in the school market contributed to the overall increase in foodservice sales. Beverage sales were down three percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first quarter of 2004, due mostly to a decrease in sales of Santa Cruz Organic(R) products. Availability of certain organic raw materials was the primary cause of the decline. Sales of R. W. Knudsen Family(R) products and the non-branded business segment were up for the first quarter of 2005 versus the first quarter of last year. Finally, industrial sales were down 14 percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the prior year's first quarter. The decrease in the industrial area was due to the final phase of the Company's plan to exit low margin contracts. Approximately $3.4 million in sales of now discontinued business were included in last year's first quarter. Sales that are planned to be discontinued are estimated at $11 million for the entire fiscal year. Share Repurchase At its most recent meeting, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan. Under the plan, the Company is authorized to purchase up to one million common shares. The buyback program will be implemented throughout the fiscal year and beyond, at management's discretion. Outlook for Fiscal 2005 The Company confirmed its objective to increase its 2005 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by its long-term growth goal of eight percent, taking into consideration the previously discussed cost increases. This equates to an earnings growth rate of approximately 24 percent in 2005. An increase of approximately eight million shares outstanding resulting from the Multifoods acquisition accounts for the difference in these growth rates. This earnings goal excludes the impacts of restructuring, merger and integration costs, and gains and losses on sales of assets. With the decision to divest the Multifoods' U.S. foodservice business and treat it as a discontinued operation, forecasted sales for 2005 have been revised to approximately $2.1 billion. Earnings for 2005 will include approximately $20 million or $0.20 per diluted share in merger and integration costs and approximately $6.5 million or $0.07 per diluted share in restructuring costs. This is an increase over the previously announced estimate of restructuring charges and primarily reflects the Company's first quarter decision to relocate some production from its Salinas, California, facility to plants in Orrville, Ohio, and Memphis, Tennessee.
