Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure Pursuant to Item 7.01, "Regulation FD Disclosure", information is being furnished with respect to the extension of The J. M. Smucker Company's voluntary odd-lot program for its eligible shareholders, which will allow shareholders with fewer than 100 shares to either sell all of their shares or to purchase additional shares to increase their holdings to 100 shares. Eligible shareholders are those registered and beneficial shareholders owning fewer than 100 Smucker common shares. The program will continue to be in effect from November 13, 2004 through December 17, 2004, unless earlier terminated. The actual price per share eligible shareholders will receive or pay will be determined by a market-based price per share that will be uniformly applied to all shareholders participating in the program from November 13, 2004 through December 17, 2004 ("Extension Period"). The price cannot be guaranteed in advance. Shares submitted for sale will be matched to shares requested for purchase by other participating shareholders. If more shares are requested for sale than for purchase, shareholders will receive or pay the average of the closing market price for The J. M. Smucker Company common shares as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the Extension Period. The Company will repurchase these net sales of shares, which will represent a portion of the one million shares the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of in August 2004. If more shares are requested for purchase than for sale, the balance of shares not matched will be purchased in the open market throughout the Extension Period and a few days afterward. A weighted average price will be determined by these market trades for the Extension Period, and that is the price shareholders will receive or will pay. Weighted averaging means the per share price is obtained by dividing the aggregate dollar amount of all purchases of shares for the participants during the Extension Period by the total number of shares purchased on behalf of such participants during the Extension Period. A copy of the press release announcing the extension of the previously announced odd-lot program, dated November 12, 2004, is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99, and is incorporated herein by reference.
