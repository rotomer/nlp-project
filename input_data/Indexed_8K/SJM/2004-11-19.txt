Exhibit 99.1 The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Record Second Quarter Results Significant Increases in Sales and Earnings Due to Acquisition of Multifoods New Products Contribute to a Strong Quarter for the Pillsbury Brand Company Confirms its Fiscal Year 2005 Outlook ORRVILLE, Ohio, Nov. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for its second quarter ended October 31, 2004, of its 2005 fiscal year. The results include a full quarter of operations of International Multifoods Corporation (Multifoods), which was acquired on June 18, 2004. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company sold its Brazilian operations, Smucker do Brasil Ltda. to Cargill, Incorporated. As previously announced, the Company sold its Australian based Henry Jones Foods business in the first quarter of 2005 and is planning to divest the U.S. foodservice business acquired as part of the Multifoods transaction. Results of these three businesses are reported as discontinued operations and all prior periods have been restated. Second Quarter Results Company sales were $588.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, up 57 percent compared to $374.2 million in the second quarter of 2004. The acquired Multifoods businesses contributed $209.2 million to sales in the second quarter of 2005. In the Company's existing business, increased sales of branded products were partially offset by declines in the oils business and the impact of planned sales rationalization. Income from continuing operations was $40.7 million, an increase of 24 percent over $32.7 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 were $0.69, compared to $0.65 last year. Improved margins on the Company's existing business and the addition of Multifoods were the primary causes for the earnings increase. These increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs, start-up costs at the Company's new Uncrustables(R) facility in Scottsville, Kentucky, and an increase in interest expense. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $4.0 million or $0.04 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $1.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 included restructuring charges of $3.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these costs, the Company's income from continuing operations was up 28 percent and earnings per diluted share would have been $0.75 and $0.69, in the second quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, an increase of nine percent. "The performance of our brands was strong and exceeded our expectations for the quarter," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "Sales for the Smucker's(R) and Jif(R) brands increased, and Pillsbury(R), with an exciting array of new products, performed well during the initial phase of the important Fall Bake period. We are already starting to see the benefits of our investments behind our newly acquired brands and are encouraged by the early results. The integration of the business remains on-track and we look forward to further opportunities as we complete the process." Net income for the second quarter of 2005 was up 19 percent to $38.0 million or $0.65 per diluted share, compared to last year's second quarter net income of $32.1 million or $0.64 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's net income was a loss from discontinued operations of $2.7 million or $0.04 per diluted share, which includes a pretax loss of $5.7 million on the Company's sale of its Brazilian operations. Loss from discontinued operations was $0.7 million or $0.01 per diluted share last year. Six-Month Results Sales for the six-month period ended October 31, 2004, were up 41 percent to $1,002.2 million compared to $713.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2004. The acquired Multifoods businesses contributed $284.5 million to sales in the first six months of 2005. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2005 was $68.2 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $59.1 million, or $1.18 per diluted share last year. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $6.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $4.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2004 included restructuring charges of $6.3 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Excluding these merger and integration and restructuring costs in the first six months of 2005 and 2004, the Company's earnings per diluted share from continuing operations would have been $1.33 and $1.26, respectively. Net income for the first six months of 2005 was $70.9 million or $1.25 per diluted share, compared to $57.9 million or $1.15 per diluted share in the first six months of last year. Included in net income for the first six months of 2005 was income from discontinued operations of $2.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Loss from discontinued operations for the first six months of 2004 was $1.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter and six-month period is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. Scottsville Plant During the first quarter of 2005, the Company commenced operations of its Uncrustables facility in Scottsville, Kentucky. As previously announced, the new facility has experienced a longer ramp-up schedule than originally anticipated although improvements were realized in the operations during the second quarter as throughput rates continued to increase. The Company incurred approximately $3.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share in costs associated with the start-up during the second quarter of 2005 and $6.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share during the first six months of 2005. These costs consist primarily of additional labor, materials, and under-absorbed overhead. The Company expects to incur additional start-up costs for the year of approximately $10 million. "We have made good progress during the second quarter," commented Richard Smucker, president, co-chief executive officer, and chief financial officer. "The number of sandwiches produced per minute, which is a key metric for us, has increased significantly since the end of the first quarter. We are encouraged by our progress and continue to remain enthusiastic about Uncrustables as a growth platform for years to come." Margins Operating income in the second quarter of 2005 increased 29 percent from the second quarter last year, primarily due to the revenue growth contributed by Multifoods. As expected, operating margin decreased from 14.1 percent in the second quarter of 2004 to 11.6 percent in the second quarter of 2005. The decline was primarily due to the decrease in gross margin, which was partially offset by an improvement in selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses as a percentage of sales. The Company's gross margin decreased from 35.5 percent in the second quarter of last year to 32.1 percent in the second quarter of this year, due primarily to the impact of the Multifoods businesses, which currently earns a lower margin than the Company's base business. Higher commodity costs also impacted gross margin. SD&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 21.1 percent in the second quarter of 2004 to 19.6 percent in the current quarter. Despite this decrease in SD&A as a percentage of sales, marketing and selling expenses increased 39 percent due to support of the Multifoods' brands. An increase in employee benefit costs and ongoing administrative expenses being incurred at the former Multifoods' headquarters in Minnesota contributed to the overall dollar increase in SD&A. For the first six months of 2005, SD&A as a percentage of sales declined from 21.5 percent to 20.6 percent. Year-to-date operating income increased $20.9 million or 22 percent over last year and operating margin declined from 13.4 percent to 11.6 percent. Interest expense increased from $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2004 to $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2005, and from $3.5 million for the first six months of 2004 to $10.2 million in the first six months of 2005, as a result of an increase in the Company's debt outstanding associated with the acquisition of Multifoods. Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market The U.S. retail market segment is comprised of the Company's consumer and consumer oils and baking business areas. This segment represents the domestic sales of Smucker's, Jif, Crisco(R), Pillsbury, Hungry Jack(R), Martha White(R), and Pet(R) branded products to retail customers. Sales in the U.S. retail market segment for the second quarter of 2005 were $410.4 million, compared to $281.7 million in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 46 percent. The Multifoods' brands contributed $126.4 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. Sales in first six months of 2005 were $698.5 million compared to $529.9 million last year, an increase of 32 percent. The Multifoods' brands contributed $166.0 million of sales for the first six months of 2005. During the second quarter of 2005, sales in the consumer area increased 17 percent over the second quarter of last year, driven by the addition of Hungry Jack, growth in the Smucker's and Jif brands, and continued growth of Uncrustables in the retail channel. In the consumer oils and baking area, sales nearly doubled in the second quarter of 2005 compared to 2004, due to the addition of the Pillsbury, Martha White, and Pet brands. Crisco branded sales in retail were down approximately six percent for the quarter, as the oils category remains very competitive. Special Markets The special markets segment is comprised of the international, foodservice, beverage, industrial, and Canada strategic business areas. The Canadian business acquired from Multifoods has been combined with the Company's previous Canadian business to form the new Canada business area. Sales in the special markets segment were $178.5 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared to $92.5 million for the second quarter of 2004. Multifoods contributed $82.8 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. All business areas were up with the exception of the industrial business. Key contributors included the beverage business and the foodservice portion control business. Excluding the contribution from Multifoods and planned declines in the industrial and international businesses, sales in the special markets segment increased eight percent in the second quarter of 2005 compared to the second quarter of last year. Industrial sales were down seven percent in the second quarter of 2005 compared to the prior year's second quarter. The decrease in the industrial area was due to the final phase of the Company's plan to exit low margin contracts. Approximately $2.7 million and $6.1 million in sales of now discontinued business were included in last year's second quarter and first six months, respectively. Sales for the first six months of 2005 in the special markets segment were $303.7 million compared to $183.4 million last year. Multifoods contributed $118.5 million in sales for the first six months of 2005. Excluding the Multifoods sales and planned declines in the industrial and international businesses, special markets increased six percent in the first six months of 2005 compared to the first six months of last year. Outlook for Fiscal 2005 The Company confirmed its objective to increase its 2005 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by its long-term growth goal of eight percent. This equates to an earnings growth rate of approximately 24 percent in 2005. An increase of approximately eight million shares outstanding resulting from the Multifoods acquisition accounts for the difference in these growth rates. This earnings goal excludes the impacts of restructuring, merger and integration costs, and gains and losses on sales of assets.
