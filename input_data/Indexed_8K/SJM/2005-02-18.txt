Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS MULTIFOODS ACQUISITION CONTRIBUTES TO RECORD SALES GROWTH OF SMUCKER'S, JIF AND CRISCO BRANDS CONTRIBUTE TO SALES AND EARNINGS GAINS COMPANY CONFIRMS ITS FISCAL YEAR 2005 OUTLOOK ORRVILLE, Ohio, Feb. 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for its third quarter ended January 31, 2005, of its 2005 fiscal year. Third Quarter Results Company sales were $550.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2005, up 60 percent compared to $343.8 million in the third quarter of 2004. The acquired Multifoods businesses contributed $187.6 million to sales in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the contribution of Multifoods, sales were up five percent. Income from continuing operations was $35.5 million, an increase of 14 percent over $31.1 million in last year's third quarter. Sales growth and improved margins on the Company's existing business and the addition of Multifoods were mostly offset by merger and integration costs, an increase in restructuring expenses, higher raw material costs, start-up costs at the Company's Uncrustables(R) facility in Scottsville, Kentucky, and an increase in interest expense over the third quarter of last year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 were $0.60, compared to $0.62 last year. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $5.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $3.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2004 included restructuring charges of $2.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Excluding these costs, the Company's income from continuing operations was up 25 percent and earnings per diluted share would have been $0.70 and $0.65, in the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, an increase of eight percent. "Our Smucker's(R), Jif(R) and Crisco(R) brands experienced good sales growth in the quarter and the new brands we acquired from Multifoods continued to perform well," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We also continue to aggressively implement our strategy to own and market leading North American icon food brands sold in the center of the store and to take the necessary steps to improve our cost base. This quarter we announced the planned sale of the foodservice and bakery products businesses acquired from Multifoods, the sale of our industrial businesses and the closing of our Salinas, California facility later this calendar year. These actions position us for improved profitability." Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was up 15 percent to $36.1 million or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to last year's third quarter net income of $31.3 million or $0.62 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's net income was income from discontinued operations of $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share. The operations of the Australian-based Henry Jones Foods business, the Brazilian operations, Smucker do Brasil Ltda., and the Multifoods' U.S. foodservice and bakery products business are included in discontinued operations. Nine-Month Results Sales for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2005, were up 47 percent to $1,552.4 million compared to $1,057.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2004. The acquired Multifoods businesses contributed $472.1 million to sales in the first nine months of 2005. Excluding the contribution of Multifoods, sales were up two percent.
Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2005 was $103.7 million or $1.81 per diluted share, compared to $90.2 million or $1.79 per diluted share last year. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $11.9 million or $0.13 per diluted share and restructuring charges of $8.1 million or $0.09 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2004 included restructuring charges of $8.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in the first nine months of 2005 and 2004, the Company's earnings per diluted share from continuing operations would have been $2.03 and $1.90, respectively, an increase of seven percent. Net income for the first nine months of 2005 was $107.0 million or $1.86 per diluted share, compared to $89.2 million or $1.77 per diluted share in the first nine months of last year. Included in net income for the first nine months of 2005 was income from discontinued operations of $3.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Loss from discontinued operations for the first nine months of 2004 was $1.0 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter and nine-month period is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. Scottsville Plant During the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company commenced operations of its Uncrustables facility in Scottsville, Kentucky. As previously announced, the new facility has experienced a longer ramp-up schedule than originally anticipated. The Company incurred approximately $6.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share in costs associated with the start-up during the third quarter of 2005 and $12.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share during the first nine months of 2005. These costs consist primarily of additional labor, materials, and unabsorbed overhead. The Company confirmed that it expects start-up costs in the second half of the fiscal year to total approximately $10 million. "During the quarter, we were able to meet demand levels and continued to make operating improvements. We expect that the Scottsville plant will provide the capacity to meet our growth and profit objectives," commented Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "More importantly, demand for Uncrustables in both the retail and schools markets continues to be strong and we expect it to be a growth platform in the years ahead." Margins Operating income in the third quarter of 2005 increased 21 percent from the third quarter last year. As expected, operating margin decreased from 14.4 percent in the third quarter of 2004 to 10.9 percent in the third quarter of 2005. The Company's gross margin decreased from 36.8 percent in the third quarter of last year to 31.7 percent in the third quarter of this year, due primarily to the impact of the Multifoods businesses, which currently earns a lower margin than the Company's base business, and higher commodity costs. The Scottsville start-up costs, an increase in restructuring costs, and merger and integration expenses further impacted operating margin. Year-to-date operating income increased $31.2 million or 21 percent over last year and operating margin declined from 13.7 percent to 11.4 percent, due to the same factors noted above.
SD&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 21.8 percent in the third quarter of 2004 to 19.3 percent in the current quarter. For the first nine months of 2005, SD&A as a percentage of sales declined from 21.6 percent to 20.1 percent. Interest expense increased from $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2004 to $6.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, and from $4.9 million for the first nine months of 2004 to $16.4 million in the first nine months of 2005, as a result of an increase in the Company's debt outstanding associated with the acquisition of Multifoods. The Company's tax rate for the quarter decreased from 37 percent in fiscal 2004 to 36 percent this year, reflecting a year-to-date adjustment of income taxes to the projected rate for the year of 36.4 percent. Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market Sales in the U.S. retail market segment for the third quarter of 2005 were $381.4 million, compared to $254.3 million in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 50 percent. The Multifoods' brands contributed $111.2 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. Sales of Smucker's, Jif and Crisco combined to increase over six percent compared to last year. Sales in the first nine months of 2005 were $1,079.9 million, compared to $784.2 million last year, an increase of 38 percent. The Multifoods' brands contributed $277.1 million of sales for the first nine months of 2005. During the third quarter of 2005, sales in the consumer area increased 21 percent over the third quarter of last year, driven by the addition of Hungry Jack(R), growth in the Smucker's and Jif brands, and continued growth of Uncrustables in the retail channel. In the consumer oils and baking area, sales more than doubled in the third quarter of 2005 compared to 2004, due to the addition of the Pillsbury(R), Martha White(R), and Pet(R) brands and a six percent increase in Crisco sales. Special Markets Sales in the special markets segment were $168.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $89.5 million for the third quarter of 2004. Multifoods contributed $76.5 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. All business areas were up with the exception of the U.S. industrial business, which the Company previously announced was being divested. Key contributors included the beverage business, up seven percent, and the foodservice business, up ten percent with growth in Uncrustables in the schools market and traditional portion control items. Excluding the contribution from Multifoods and the industrial business, sales in the special markets segment increased ten percent in the third quarter of 2005 as compared to the third quarter of last year. Sales for the first nine months of 2005 in the special markets segment were $472.5 million, compared to $272.9 million last year. Multifoods contributed $194.9 million in sales for the first nine months of 2005. Excluding the Multifoods sales and the industrial business, special markets increased six percent in the first nine months of 2005 compared to the first nine months of last year. Outlook for Fiscal 2005 The Company confirmed its objective to increase its 2005 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by its long-term growth goal of eight percent. This equates to an earnings growth rate of approximately 23 percent in 2005. An increase of approximately eight million shares outstanding resulting from the Multifoods acquisition accounts for the difference in these growth rates. This earnings goal excludes the impacts of restructuring, merger and integration costs, and gains and losses on sales of assets.
The Company confirmed total merger and integration costs related to the Multifoods transaction at $20 million. Approximately $15 million of these costs will be incurred in fiscal year 2005 and the remainder is expected to be incurred in fiscal year 2006. Earnings for 2005 are expected to include approximately $10 to 12 million in restructuring costs. The increase in the restructuring estimates reflects the additional costs related to the Company's announced closing of its Salinas, California, facility and the restructuring of its distribution operations.
