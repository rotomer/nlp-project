Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS COMPANY AGAIN ACHIEVES RECORD FULL-YEAR SALES AND EARNINGS SMUCKER'S, JIF AND CRISCO BRANDS CONTINUE TO GROW MULTIFOODS ACQUISITION ADDS TO BASE BUSINESS GROWTH COMPANY PROVIDES ITS FISCAL YEAR 2006 OUTLOOK ORRVILLE, Ohio, June 16, 2005---The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 30, 2005. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Company sales were $491.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, up 57 percent compared to $312.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The acquired Multifoods businesses contributed $154.1 million to sales in the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding the contribution of Multifoods, sales were up eight percent. Income from continuing operations was $26.8 million, an increase of 27 percent over $21.1 million in last year's fourth quarter. Sales growth and improved margins on the Company's existing business and the addition of Multifoods were mostly offset by merger and integration costs, an increase in restructuring expenses, start-up costs at the Company's Uncrustables(R) facility in Scottsville, Kentucky, and an increase in interest expense over the fourth quarter of last year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $0.45, compared to $0.42 last year. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $6.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $5.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Included in other income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was a net gain of approximately $0.02 per share related to the sale of the Company's Watsonville, California, facility. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2004 included pretax merger and integration costs of $1.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $7.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income from continuing operations was up 29 percent and earnings per diluted share would have been $0.58 and $0.52, in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, an increase of twelve percent. "Once again, our Smucker's(R), Jif(R) and Crisco(R) brands experienced good sales growth in the quarter, and the addition of the brands we acquired from Multifoods enhanced our performance," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "For the year, the strong performance of our brands enabled us to absorb the startup costs at our new Uncrustables(R) facility and still achieve record earnings. We have positive momentum for the new year and are well-positioned to continue to grow profitably." Net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was down slightly to $22.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to last year's fourth quarter net income of $22.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. Included in this quarter's net income was a loss from discontinued operations of $4.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share compared to earnings from discontinued operations last year of $1.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. The operations of the Australian-based Henry Jones Foods business, the Brazilian operations, Smucker do Brasil Ltda., and the Multifoods' U.S. foodservice and bakery products business, all sold during the year, are included in discontinued operations. FULL-YEAR RESULTS Sales for the year ended April 30, 2005, were up 49 percent to $2,043.9 million, compared to $1,369.6 million in 2004. The acquired Multifoods businesses contributed $626.2 million to sales in 2005. Excluding the contribution of Multifoods and the industrial business, which was divested, sales were up five percent.
Income from continuing operations for 2005 was $130.5 million, or $2.26 per diluted share, compared to $111.3 million, or $2.21 per diluted share last year, an increase of 17 percent. Income from continuing operations for 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $18.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $13.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for 2004 included pretax merger and integration costs of $1.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $15.8 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in 2005 and 2004, the Company's earnings per diluted share from continuing operations would have been $2.60 and $2.42, respectively. "We are pleased with our performance for the year. We also remained focused on implementing our core strategy by selling several businesses that were not consistent with owning and marketing leading North American icon food brands sold in the center of the store," commented Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "In addition, we made significant progress on our integration of the Multifoods businesses and took actions to generate greater supply chain savings in order to position us for improved profitability." Net income for 2005 was $129.1 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, compared to $111.4 million, or $2.21 per diluted share last year. Included in net income for 2005 was a loss from discontinued operations of $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Income from discontinued operations for 2004 was $0.1 million. The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter and year is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. SCOTTSVILLE PLANT During the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company commenced operations of its Uncrustables facility in Scottsville, Kentucky. The Company has incurred start-up costs consisting primarily of additional labor, materials, and unabsorbed overhead. Production throughputs continue to improve at expected levels, and production is expected to continue to improve throughout 2006. The Company incurred approximately $6.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in costs associated with the start-up during the fourth quarter of 2005 and $19.0 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the full year. Sales of Uncrustables for the year were approximately $60 million, an increase of 20 percent over last year. The Company continues to fully supply its customers and expects to have sufficient supply to meet future forecasted demand. MARGINS Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 40 percent from the fourth quarter last year. As expected, operating margin decreased from 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 9.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company's gross margin decreased from 33.2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 30.6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, due primarily to the impact of the Multifoods businesses, which currently earn a lower margin than the Company's base business, and higher commodity costs. The Scottsville start-up costs, an increase in restructuring costs, and merger and integration expenses further impacted operating margin. 2
SD&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 21.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 19.4 percent in the current quarter. For the year, SD&A as a percentage of sales declined from 21.7 percent to 20.0 percent. Operating income for 2005 increased $43.8 million, or 25 percent, over last year and operating margin declined from 12.9 percent to 10.8 percent, due to the same factors impacting gross margin. Interest expense increased from $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and from $6.2 million in 2004 to $22.6 million in 2005, as a result of an increase in the Company's debt outstanding associated with the acquisition of Multifoods. SEGMENT PERFORMANCE U.S. RETAIL MARKET Sales in the U.S. retail market segment for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $325.3 million, compared to $218.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 49 percent. The Multifoods' brands contributed $79.0 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. Excluding the contribution of Multifoods, sales were up 13 percent for the quarter. Sales for 2005 were $1,405.2 million, compared to $1,002.3 million last year, an increase of 40 percent. The Multifoods' brands contributed $356.2 million of sales in 2005. Excluding the contribution of Multifoods, sales were up five percent for the year. During the fourth quarter of 2005, sales in the consumer area increased 23 percent over the fourth quarter of last year, primarily driven by the addition of Hungry Jack(R), growth in the Smucker's and Jif brands, and continued growth of Uncrustables in the retail channel. In the consumer oils and baking area, sales more than doubled in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004, due to the addition of the Pillsbury(R), Martha White(R), and Pet(R) brands and an increase in Crisco sales of over 20 percent. SPECIAL MARKETS Sales in the special markets segment were $166.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $94.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. Multifoods contributed $75.1 million of the segment's sales in the quarter. Key contributors included the beverage business, up nine percent, and the foodservice business, up seven percent. Excluding the contribution from Multifoods and the U.S. industrial business, which the Company divested during the year, sales in the special markets segment increased five percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Sales in the special markets segment were $638.7 million in 2005, compared to $367.3 million last year. Multifoods contributed $270.0 million of sales in 2005. Excluding the Multifoods sales and the U.S. industrial business, sales in the special markets segment were up five percent compared to last year. OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2006 Results for 2006 will include an additional one and one-half months of Multifoods' operations compared to 2005. Operations for Multifoods in 2005 were included from the acquisition closing date of June 18, 2004. The Company expects revenues in 2006 of approximately $2.16 billion, an increase of six percent. Growth in the base business and an additional month and one-half of Multifoods operations in 2006 will be partially offset by a reduction in sales due to the exit of the Company's industrial businesses. 3
The Company remains committed to increasing its earnings per share by its long-term annualized growth goal of eight percent, which equates to an earnings growth of approximately ten percent. The additional share count for 2006 accounts for the difference in the growth rates. This goal applies to continuing operations and excludes the impacts of restructuring, merger and integration costs, and gains and losses on sales of assets. Earnings for 2006 are expected to include approximately $12 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in merger and integration costs and approximately $8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in restructuring costs. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $75 million to $80 million in 2006.
