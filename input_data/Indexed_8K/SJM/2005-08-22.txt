Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS UP NINE PERCENT SALES UP 23 PERCENT COMPANY CONFIRMS ITS FISCAL YEAR 2006 OUTLOOK ORRVILLE, Ohio, Aug. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2005, of its 2006 fiscal year. First Quarter Results Company sales were a record $510.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, up 23 percent, compared to $413.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. The acquired Multifoods businesses contributed $154.3 million to sales in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $75.5 million last year. Since the acquisition of Multifoods closed midway through the first quarter of last year, an additional six weeks of Multifoods' sales, totaling approximately $78.8 million, were realized in this year's first quarter. Excluding the additional six weeks, sales were up four percent, in line with the Company's previously stated growth goals. Income from continuing operations was $29.9 million, an increase of nine percent over $27.5 million in last year's first quarter. Sales growth was mostly offset by increased marketing costs in support of the brands, costs associated with establishing the Company's new distribution network, an increase in net interest expense, and compensation expense related to the Company's new restricted stock program. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2006 were $0.51, compared to $0.50 last year, impacted by the additional shares issued as part of the Multifoods transaction. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $2.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $1.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $2.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $3.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income from continuing operations was up six percent. Due to the additional shares issued as part of the Multifoods transaction, earnings per diluted share were $0.56 and $0.57, in the first quarters of 2006 and 2005, respectively. "Our Smucker's(R), Jif(R), Crisco(R), and Pillsbury(R) brands continue to experience considerable momentum," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "During the quarter, we made significant investments in new products and in support of the brands, along with our supply chain initiatives. Income from continuing operations grew nine percent for the quarter, as the performance of the brands offset these investments. We are well-positioned for continuing top and bottom line growth." "We are excited about the many new products we are introducing in the upcoming quarter and expect them to enhance our growth prospects," commented Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "With the solid sales growth, new products and significant marketing support, our brands are well-positioned for strong performance. We remain committed to our outlook for the year of growing our earnings per share by our long-term annualized growth rate of eight percent." Net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $29.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. Last year's first quarter net income was comprised of income from continuing operations of $27.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, and earnings from discontinued operations, primarily representing the one-time, nonrecurring gain on the Company's sale of its Henry Jones Foods business, of $5.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for a total of $32.8 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. The operations of the Australian-based Henry Jones Foods business, the Brazilian operations, Smucker do Brasil Ltda., and the Multifoods' U.S. foodservice and bakery products business, all sold during last year, are included in discontinued operations in 2005.
The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. Margins Gross margin was 32.3 percent in the first quarter, compared to 34.9 percent last year, primarily due to higher commodity costs and the impact of the incremental Multifoods businesses, which currently earn a lower margin than the Company's base business. In addition, as part of the sale of its industrial business last fiscal year, the Company agreed to continue to supply the purchaser with certain industrial products through August 2005. Sales of these products are recognized on a cost-plus basis, and will continue to have a negative impact on gross margins through August. SD&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 22.0 percent in the first quarter of 2005 to 21.7 percent in the current quarter, despite a planned increase in marketing expenses, which were up 15 percent over last year. Also included in the quarter's SD&A expenses were non-cash charges of approximately $2.4 million representing amortization expense associated with the Company's new restricted stock program, and $1.2 million in accelerated depreciation of certain discontinued software. Finally, distribution costs were also up during the quarter, as the Company implemented its new distribution network. Interest expense increased from $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2005 to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2006, as a result of additional debt associated with the acquisition of Multifoods, which was outstanding for the full quarter. Interest income also increased due to higher average investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The Company's first quarter earnings benefited from a decrease in the effective tax rate from 36.6 percent in 2005 to 34.4 percent this quarter. The Company expects a tax rate for the full year of approximately 35.5 percent. Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market Sales in the U.S. retail market segment for the first quarter of 2006 were $341.7 million, compared to $288.1 million in the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 19 percent. Sales for the brands acquired in the Multifoods acquisition in the first six weeks of the quarter accounted for approximately three-fourths of the segment's increase over the prior year. Excluding these additional sales, the segment was up five percent for the quarter. During the first quarter of 2006, sales in the consumer area increased 11 percent over the first quarter of last year, driven by the addition of Hungry Jack(R), growth in the Smucker's and Jif brands, and continued growth of Uncrustables(R) in the retail channel. In the consumer oils and baking area, sales increased 35 percent in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 2005, due to the additional six weeks of sales of the Pillsbury, Martha White(R), and Pet(R) brands, as well as a three percent increase in Crisco sales. Special Markets Sales in the special markets segment were $168.6 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $125.2 million for the first quarter of 2005. Canadian and export sales for the brands acquired in the Multifoods acquisition in the first six weeks of the quarter accounted for over 90 percent of the segment's increase over the prior year. Other key growth contributors included the beverage business, up 15 percent, and the foodservice business, up eight percent. Excluding the additional six weeks contribution from Multifoods and the U.S. industrial business, which the Company divested last year, sales in the special markets segment increased six percent in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the first quarter of last year.
Outlook for Fiscal 2006 The Company confirmed its outlook for 2006. The Company expects revenues in 2006 of approximately $2.16 billion, an increase of six percent and remains committed to increasing its earnings per share by its long-term annualized growth goal of eight percent, which equates to an earnings growth of approximately ten percent. The additional outstanding shares for 2006 account for the difference in the growth rates. This long-term growth goal applies to continuing operations and excludes the impact of restructuring, merger and integration costs, and gains and losses on sales of assets.
