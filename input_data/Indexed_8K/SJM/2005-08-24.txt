Smucker Company (the "Company") approved changes to the Company's Amended and Restated Nonemployee Director Stock Plan, effective as of August 19, 2005 (the "Plan"), in response to the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act"). The changes to the Plan create additional sub-accounts under the Plan to reflect amounts that are "deferred," as such term is defined in the guidance, issued by the Internal Revenue Service with regard to the Jobs Act (the "Guidance") as of December 31, 2004 and earnings thereon accrued through December 31, 2004 (the "Pre-2005 Sub-Account") and amounts that are deferred after December 31, 2004, earnings thereon and earnings on the amount in the Pre-2005 Sub-Account that accrue after December 31, 2004 (the "Post-2004 Sub-Account"). The Pre-2005 Sub-Account will remain subject to the provisions of the Plan in effect prior to the enactment of the Jobs Act and the law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to the addition of Section 409A to the Internal Revenue Code, to the extent permitted by the Jobs Act and the Guidance. The Post-2004 Sub-Accounts will be subject to the amended provisions of the Plan that implement the restrictions of the Jobs Act. In addition, the Plan was amended to allow participants in the Plan to make appropriate deferral elections and to receive distributions under the Plan in compliance with the Jobs Act. The Plan is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

The Company shall be entitled, but not obligated, to establish a grantor trust or similar funding mechanism to fund the Company's obligations under this Plan; provided, however, that any funds contained therein shall remain subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors. The funding mechanism shall constitute an unfunded arrangement and shall not affect the status of the Plan as an unfunded plan maintained for the purpose of providing compensation for a select group of management for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974. ARTICLE 8. AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION 8.1 Amendment, Modification, and Termination. Subject to the terms set forth in this Article 8, the Board may terminate, amend, or modify the Plan at any time and from time to time. 8.2 Awards Previously Granted. Unless required by law, no termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall in any material manner adversely affect any Award previously provided under the Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding the Award. ARTICLE 9. MISCELLANEOUS 9.1 Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural. 9.2 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 9.3 Beneficiary Designation. Each Participant under the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in the event of his or her death. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Board, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Board during his or her lifetime. In the absence of any such designation or if no designated beneficiary survives the Participant, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate in Shares in a single distribution. 9.4 Nonalienation of Interest. Except as permitted by this Plan, no right or interest under this Plan of any Participant or beneficiary shall, without the written consent of the Company, be (i) assignable or transferable in any manner, (ii) subject to alienation, anticipation, sale, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or (iii) in any manner liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of the Participant or his or her beneficiary. 9.5 Interest of Participant. The obligation of the Company under the Plan to make payment under this Plan merely constitutes the unsecured promise of the Company to make payments in the form of its Shares, as provided herein, and no Participant or beneficiary shall have any interest in, or lien or prior claim upon, any property of the Company. It is the intention of the Company that the Plan be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974. - 6 -
9.6 No Right of Nomination. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any Director for reelection by the Company's shareholders. 9.7 Shares Available. Shares delivered by the Company under the Plan shall be newly issued Shares or treasury shares, or Shares which have been or may be reacquired by the Company. Any funding mechanism as described in Section 7.6 of this Plan may acquire treasury shares from the Company or purchase Shares on the open market. 9.8 Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Plan comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code with respect to Post-2004 Sub-Accounts. With respect to Pre-2005 Sub-Accounts, it is intended that such sub-accounts qualify for "grandfathered" status and continue to be governed by the law applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation prior to enactment of Section 409A of the Code. This Plan shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause a Post-2004 Sub-Account to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall have no force and effect until amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code and may be made by the Company without the consent of the Participants). 9.9 Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 9.10 Requirements of Law. The granting of Awards under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. 9.11 Governing Law. The Plan, and any agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal, substantive laws of the State of Ohio. - 7 -
