Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Second Quarter Highlights - Record Sales and Earnings for the Quarter: Sales up 3 percent and earnings per share from continuing operations up 14 percent. - Good Sales Growth: All core businesses experienced growth. - Update of 2006 Outlook: Strong first half performance provides good momentum for the year, while the second half will be challenged by higher energy and fuel related costs. EPS growth expected to be in the range of 5 to 8 percent. ORRVILLE, Ohio, Nov. 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the second quarter ended October 31, 2005, of its 2006 fiscal year. Second Quarter Results All core businesses experienced sales growth during the quarter. Excluding the U.S. industrial business, which has been divested, sales were up 4 percent. The quarter and first six months' results included a favorable adjustment of approximately $6.7 million to sales and approximately $4.3 million after-tax to earnings reflecting a change in estimate of the expected liability for trade merchandising programs. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $4.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $2.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $4.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $1.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's earnings per diluted share would have been $0.86 and $0.75, in the second quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 15 percent. "The performance of our businesses continues to offset the significant investments we are making in support of the brands and in our supply chain initiatives and the cost pressures currently impacting the consumer packaged goods sector," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We are well-positioned for continuing top and bottom line growth." Six-Month Results
Since the acquisition of Multifoods closed midway through the first quarter of last year, an additional six weeks of Multifoods' sales, totaling approximately $78.8 million, were realized in this year's first six months. Excluding the additional six weeks and the U.S. industrial business, sales were up 5 percent. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $7.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $3.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $6.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $4.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's earnings per diluted share would have been $1.42 and $1.33, in the first six months of 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 7 percent. The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter and six-month period is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. Second Quarter First Six Months --------------- ---------------- Margins 2006 2005 2006 2005 - -------------------- ------ ------ ------ ------- Gross margin 33.6% 32.1% 33.0% 33.2% SD&A % of sales 19.8% 19.6% 20.7% 20.6% Operating margin 12.8% 11.6% 11.4% 11.6% Gross margin improvements were driven by a more profitable mix of sales and improved costs in the consumer oils and baking business area were partially offset by higher commodity and freight costs. The trade liability change in estimate contributed approximately half of the improvement. Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly as a result of a planned increase in marketing expenses and increased distribution costs related to the implementation of the new distribution network. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and administrative overhead costs. Segment Performance
U.S. Retail Market U.S. retail market sales were up 3 percent excluding the trade liability change in estimate with the consumer business area up 4 percent and the consumer oils and baking business area up 2 percent. Increases in the consumer business area were driven by growth in the Smucker's(R), Jif(R) and Uncrustables(R) brands. In the consumer oils and baking business area, sales increased due to growth in the Crisco(R) brand. Since the acquisition of Multifoods closed midway through the first quarter of last year, an additional six weeks of Multifoods' sales were realized in this year's first six months. These additional sales accounted for approximately half of the segment's increase over the prior year. Excluding these additional sales, the segment was up 5 percent for the first six months. Special Markets Key growth contributors for the quarter included the foodservice business area, up 9 percent, and the beverage business area, up 6 percent. Sales in Canada were down 2 percent, as increases in the core retail business and favorable foreign exchange partially offset the planned rationalization of certain unprofitable industrial business. For the first six months, excluding the additional six weeks contribution from Multifoods and the U.S. industrial business, sales in the special markets segment increased 5 percent in the first six months of 2006 as compared to the first six months of last year. Outlook for Fiscal 2006 Similar to other consumer packaged goods companies, volatility of energy and petroleum costs will challenge the outlook for the second half of 2006. Additional costs in the range of $0.10 to $0.15 per share for natural gas, freight, and resins are expected to be incurred during the last six months. The Company has taken, and will continue to take, actions to offset these cost increases including both discretionary cost reductions across the organization and potential pricing actions. Based on the input cost pressures and the uncertainty of their levels, it is likely that the earnings per share growth rate for the year will fall within the range of 5 to 8 percent. The Company remains committed to its long-term growth rate of 8 percent over its strategic time frame. "We have always taken a long-term view of running the business," commented Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "While we face considerable cost pressures in the second half of the year, we will continue to invest in new products, marketing, and distribution to ensure long-term steady growth, resulting in proven returns for our shareholders."
