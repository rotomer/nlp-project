Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT ITS LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY ORRVILLE, Ohio, Feb. 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the third quarter ended January 31, 2006, of its 2006 fiscal year. Third Quarter Results 2006 2005 % Change ----------- ----------- --------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 536.5 $ 550.2 -3% Income from continuing operations $ 31.3 $ 35.5 -12% EPS from continuing operations $ 0.54 $ 0.60 -10% Excluding the U.S. industrial business, which has been divested, sales were down 1 percent for the quarter. The quarter's results were adversely affected by a decrease in sales in the consumer oils and baking business area due to an overall decline in the categories during December and January and unplanned inventory reductions by certain key customers. In addition, the Company experienced higher energy, commodity, and distribution costs in the quarter compared to last year. "Our business remains solid for the year and we had a successful Fall Bake," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "However, our quarter was adversely affected by a decrease in sales in our oils and baking businesses and higher operating costs. We are confident that the fundamentals of the business have not changed and we remain committed to our long-term growth goals." Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $7.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $5.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Included in other income for the quarter was a pretax gain of $5.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to the sale of the Company's Salinas, California, facility. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $5.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $3.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's earnings per diluted share would have been $0.68 and $0.70, in the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Nine-Month Results 2006 2005 % Change ----------- ----------- --------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 1,653.0 $ 1,552.4 +6% Income from continuing operations $ 107.7 $ 103.7 +4% EPS from continuing operations $ 1.83 $ 1.81 +1%
Since the acquisition of Multifoods closed midway through the first quarter of last year, an additional six weeks of Multifoods' sales, totaling approximately $78.8 million, were realized in this year's first nine months. Excluding the additional six weeks and the U.S. industrial business, sales were up 3 percent. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $14.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $9.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $11.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $8.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's earnings per diluted share would have been $2.09 and $2.03, for the first nine months of 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter and nine-month period is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. Margins Third Quarter First Nine Months -------------------- -------------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 -------- -------- -------- -------- Gross margin 30.5% 31.7% 32.2% 32.7% SD&A % of sales 19.3% 19.3% 20.2% 20.1% Operating margin 8.9% 10.9% 10.6% 11.4% Approximately one-half of the decline in operating margin for the quarter was due to the increase in restructuring and merger and integration costs over last year. The remainder was due to changes in gross margin. Gross margin declined primarily due to the volume decrease in the consumer oils and baking business area, increased trade merchandising expenses, and higher commodity and freight costs. The decline in gross margin flowed through to operating margin as the percentage of selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses to sales were flat for the quarter. Increased costs associated with the Company's distribution network were offset by a reduction in marketing and selling expenses and lower administrative overhead costs. Excluding the restructuring and merger and integration costs, operating margins would have been 11.3 percent and 12.4 percent for the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, and 12.0 percent and 12.7 percent for the first nine months of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Segment Performance Sales (Dollars in millions)
U.S. Retail Market During the third quarter of 2006, sales in the consumer business area increased 4 percent over the third quarter of last year as sales of fruit spreads, toppings, and peanut butter were all up. Solid performance in the Hungry Jack(R) brand and significant growth in Uncrustables(R) also contributed. For the first nine months of 2006, sales in the consumer business area were up 7 percent compared to last year. In the consumer oils and baking business area, sales for the quarter were down 8 percent as the Company faced significant competitive activity. Although sales of Crisco(R) were up over last year for the first nine months, much of the gain was given back in December and January as a result of lower sell through and inventory reductions by key customers. The Pillsbury(R) brand had a solid first six months but reflected similar declines in the category during December and January. Sales in the consumer oils and baking business area were up slightly during the Fall Bake period running from September through December, compared to the same period last year. Special Markets Key growth contributors for the quarter included the beverage business area, up 16 percent, and the foodservice business area, up 5 percent. Sales in Canada were down 6 percent, as increases in the retail spreads business and the impact of favorable exchange rates partially offset declines in baking and the planned rationalization of certain unprofitable businesses. Excluding the additional six weeks contribution from Multifoods and the U.S. industrial business, sales in the special markets segment increased 4 percent in the first nine months of 2006 as compared to the first nine months of last year. Sale of Salinas Facility During the third quarter, the Company completed its restructuring efforts around its Salinas, California, manufacturing and distribution facility. In January 2006, the Company completed the sale of the facility resulting in cash proceeds of $8.8 million and a gain on the sale of $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Production has been transferred to facilities in Orrville, Ohio, and Memphis, Tennessee, while distribution will be handled through a third-party warehouse in southern California. Share Repurchase At its most recent meeting, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase to its share repurchase plan. Under the plan, the Company is authorized to purchase an additional 2 million common shares. The buyback program will be implemented at management's discretion. During the third quarter, the Company purchased 200,000 shares toward the previously authorized 1 million shares leaving approximately 30,000 remaining. Outlook The Company expects sales for the year of approximately $2.14 billion. The Company has taken, and will continue to take, actions to offset the cost increases it has experienced including both discretionary cost reductions across the organization and potential pricing actions. Based on the input cost pressures and the uncertainty of their levels, the Company expects earnings per share for the year, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs and the gain on the sale of the Salinas facility, to be comparable with last year's result of $2.60 per diluted share. The Company remains committed to its long-term annual growth rate for earnings per share of 8 percent over its strategic time frame.
