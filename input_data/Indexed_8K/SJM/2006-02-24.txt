Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES PLANS TO ACQUIRE ONE MILLION SHARES UNDER RULE 10b5-1 ORRVILLE, Ohio, February 24, 2006 -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced that it has entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with a broker to facilitate the repurchase of up to one million of its common shares under its previously announced share repurchase authorization. Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to purchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The shares to be repurchased under the Company's 10b5-1 plan would be part of the share repurchase authorization approved by the Company's Board of Directors in January 2006 to repurchase up to two million of its common shares. The 10b5-1 share purchase period will commence on Monday, February 27, 2006. Purchases will be affected by a broker and will be based upon the guidelines and parameters of the 10b5-1 plan. The aggregate amount of shares purchased pursuant to the plan will not exceed one million shares. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the share repurchase program, and the Company may discontinue purchases at any time. Repurchased shares would be returned to the status of authorized but unissued common shares. ABOUT THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY The J. M.
