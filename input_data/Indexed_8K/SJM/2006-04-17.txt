The annual award will be granted out of the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan which will be submitted to shareholders of the Company for approval at the August 17, 2006 Annual Meeting.  If shareholders approve the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan, the first such award will become effective October 1, 2006.  The annual deferred stock unit award will replace the annual awards of 2,000 stock options and 400 deferred stock units currently in effect.
          Additionally, the following changes related to retainer and meeting fees will go into effect on October 1, 2006.  The retainer and meeting fees will be paid on a quarterly basis.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
