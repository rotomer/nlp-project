Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS ORRVILLE, Ohio, June 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 30, 2006. Fourth Quarter Results Sales in each of the Company's strategic business areas increased over the prior year, with the exception of Canada, which was down slightly as a result of a planned sales rationalization. Excluding the U.S. industrial business, which has been divested, sales were up 4 percent for the quarter, led by growth in the Smucker's(R), Jif(R), and Pillsbury(R) brands. The increase in income from continuing operations for the quarter was driven by sales growth, improved profitability in the Uncrustables(R) business, and decreases in merger and integration and restructuring charges. In addition, during the quarter the Company reduced its effective tax rate for the year from 35.5 percent to 33.5 percent, resulting in a favorable adjustment to income taxes in the fourth quarter. The lower rate results from the Company's realignment of its legal entity structure, coupled with recent state tax law and rate changes. "For the fourth quarter and the year, we delivered record results while making investments in future growth despite a difficult cost environment," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "As we look forward, we are confident in our strategy and in the fundamentals of the business." "We recognize the dedicated efforts of our employees," added Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "During the year, we revamped our supply chain to better meet the needs of our customers and consumers, and executed on many other initiatives in support of our strategy for long-term growth of the brands. The support of our employees will enable us to continue to generate strong performance in the years to come." Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $3.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $6.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $5.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's earnings per diluted share would have been $0.68 and $0.58, in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 17 percent.
Full Year Results Since the acquisition of Multifoods closed midway through the first quarter of last year, an additional six weeks of Multifoods' sales were realized in this year's results. Excluding the additional six weeks and the U.S. industrial business, sales for 2006 were up 3 percent compared to last year. Income from continuing operations for 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $17.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $10.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Also included in income from continuing operations for the year was a pretax gain of $5.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to the sale of the Company's Salinas, California, facility. Income from continuing operations for the full year of 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $18.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $13.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's earnings per diluted share would have been $2.77 and $2.60, for the full years of 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company uses earnings and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for the current quarter and full year is included in the "Financial Highlights" table.
Margins Fourth Quarter Full Year -------------------- -------------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 -------- -------- -------- -------- Gross margin 32.1% 30.6% 32.2% 32.2% SD&A % of sales 20.8% 19.4% 20.3% 20.0% Operating margin 10.8% 9.0% 10.6% 10.8% The improvement in the fourth quarter operating margin was due to an increase in gross margin and an overall decrease in restructuring and merger and integration costs compared to last year. The increase in gross margin was caused by a decrease in trade merchandise expenses as a percent of sales and a reduction of costs at certain manufacturing and processing locations, partially offset by higher freight costs versus a year ago and generally higher raw material costs. SD&A expenses increased as a percent of sales during the fourth quarter as marketing expenses increased over the fourth quarter of last year. Distribution costs also were higher compared to the same period last year. For the full year, the slight decrease in operating margin was due primarily to costs associated with the implementation of the new distribution network. Despite higher commodity and freight costs, gross margins were maintained by realizing cost synergies associated with the Multifoods acquisition, efficiencies at certain manufacturing sites, and the impact of the trade merchandising adjustment in the second quarter. Total restructuring and merger and integration costs were down from last year, which positively impacted operating margin by nearly 20 basis points. Excluding the restructuring and merger and integration costs, operating margins would have been 11.6 percent and 11.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005, and 11.9 percent and 12.3 percent for the full year of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Segment Performance Sales (Dollars in millions) U.S. Retail Market During the fourth quarter of 2006, sales in the consumer strategic business area increased 4 percent over the fourth quarter of last year as sales of fruit spreads, toppings, peanut butter and Uncrustables were all up. For the full year of 2006, sales in the consumer strategic business area were up 6 percent compared to last year. In the consumer oils and baking strategic business area, sales for the quarter were also up 4 percent, as growth in the Pillsbury and Martha White(R) brands more than offset declines in the oils business. Sales in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area for the full year were up 5 percent compared to last year.
Excluding the additional six weeks contribution from Multifoods, sales in the U.S. retail market segment increased 3 percent in the full year of 2006 as compared to last year. Special Markets Sales in the fourth quarter for the special markets segment, excluding the industrial business, increased 5 percent. Key growth contributors for the quarter included the beverage strategic business area, up 14 percent, and the foodservice strategic business area, up 4 percent. In Canada, sales were down 2 percent, as increases in the retail spreads business and the impact of favorable exchange rates did not fully offset declines in baking and the planned rationalization of certain unprofitable businesses. Excluding the additional six weeks contribution from Multifoods and the U.S. industrial business, sales in the special markets segment increased 4 percent in the full year of 2006 as compared to last year. Share Repurchase During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased an additional 1.29 million shares for $51.6 million in cash. At its April meeting, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 2 million share increase to its share repurchase plan, leaving a total of approximately 2.7 million shares available for future repurchase. Outlook The Company confirmed its long-term sales growth goal of 8 percent, one-half of which is to come from its core business and new products, and the remainder from acquisitions. Long-term earnings per share growth would be in line with sales growth. The Company recognizes that acquisitions may not occur each year, but, over time, acquisitions have contributed to growth rates consistent with the Company's strategic objective.
