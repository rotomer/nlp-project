Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS ORRVILLE, Ohio, Aug. 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2006, of its 2007 fiscal year. First Quarter Results 2007 2006 % Change ------------- ------------- ------------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 526.5 $ 510.3 +3% Net income $ 28.7 $ 29.9 -4% Net income per diluted share $ 0.50 $ 0.51 -2% Sales, excluding the U.S. industrial business, which has been divested, increased 5 percent in the quarter, led by growth in the Smucker's(R) and Jif(R) brands along with strong performance across the special markets segment. Sales growth and a decrease in administrative costs more than offset increases in certain raw material costs in the quarter. However, charges related to the restructuring of the Company's Canadian operations, as detailed below, resulted in a decline in net income and net income per diluted share. Net income for the first quarter of 2007 included pretax restructuring charges of $7.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, primarily related to the previously announced divestiture of the nonbranded, grain-based Canadian operations. Net income for the first quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $2.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $1.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share would have been $0.59 and $0.56, in the first quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 5 percent. "We reported good sales growth in the quarter and, despite significantly higher raw material costs, were able to continue to grow our earnings," said Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We continue to implement our strategy to focus on core retail brands with the restructuring of our Canadian businesses. We expect investments in our brands to provide opportunities for continued growth." "We are well positioned for continuing top- and bottom-line growth, despite the challenges of further raw material cost increases," added Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "We will continue to take actions to offset these increases, including both discretionary cost reductions and potential pricing actions." The Company uses income and income per diluted share, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, management believes the presentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income for the current quarter is included in the "Financial Highlights" table.
Margins First Quarter ------------------- 2007 2006 -------- -------- Gross margin 30.0% 32.3% SD&A % of sales 20.6% 21.7% Operating margin 9.3% 9.7% The decline in gross margin this quarter was mainly due to the impact of the Canadian restructuring. However, over time, the Company expects the restructuring to improve margins. Higher raw material costs, primarily soybean oil, fruit and wheat, along with energy-related costs, and mix of sales also contributed to the lower gross margin. The Company continues to take pricing actions to offset a portion of the increased input costs. Due to the timing of these pricing actions, current cost increases have not been fully offset. SD&A expenses as a percent of sales declined during the first quarter, primarily due to lower corporate administrative and marketing expenses, partially offset by higher distribution costs, compared to the same period last year. Excluding the restructuring and merger and integration costs, operating margins would have been 10.8 percent and 10.6 percent for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively. On May 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised), Share-Based Payments, using the modified prospective method. The impact of the adoption was not significant for the period. Segment Performance First Quarter ------------------------------ Sales (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 % Change - ------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- U.S. retail market $ 353.3 $ 341.7 +3% Special markets $ 173.2 $ 168.6 +3% Special markets, excluding industrial $ 170.3 $ 156.6 +9% U.S. Retail Market During the first quarter of 2007, sales in the consumer strategic business area increased 8 percent over the first quarter of last year, as sales of fruit spreads, toppings, peanut butter, and Uncrustables(R) were all up. In the consumer oils and baking strategic business area, sales for the quarter were down 4 percent. Approximately one-half of the decline was attributable to a decrease in industrial oil sales, with the retail oils and baking businesses contributing almost equally to the remainder of the decline. Special Markets Sales in the first quarter for the special markets segment, excluding the industrial business, increased 9 percent. All strategic business areas in special markets were up, with the international business area up 30 percent; beverage up 21 percent, driven by growth in natural and organic products sold under the R.W. Knudsen Family(R) and Santa Cruz Organic(R) brands; foodservice up 5 percent; and Canada up 4 percent. The increase in Canada was driven by the impact of favorable exchange rates and the acquisition of the Five Roses(R) flour brand during the quarter, which offset declines in baking and the planned rationalization of certain unprofitable business. Restructuring of Canadian Operations The Company's strategy is to own and market leading North American food brands sold in the center of the store. The Canadian grain-based foodservice and industrial businesses, acquired as part of the International Multifoods acquisition in June 2004, are not aligned with this strategy. During the quarter, the Company announced an agreement to sell these businesses as part of the strategic plan to focus the Canadian operations on its consumer retail business. As previously announced, this sale and related restructuring activities are expected to result in pretax expense of approximately $10 to $15 million, which will be reported as a restructuring charge. Costs will include noncash, long-lived asset charges, as well as transaction, legal, severance, and pension costs. During the quarter, charges of $7.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, were recognized related to the Canadian restructuring.
Share Repurchase The Company also announces that it will enter into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to facilitate the repurchase of up to one million of its common shares under its previously announced share repurchase authorization. Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to purchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The shares to be repurchased under the Company's 10b5-1 plan would be part of the share repurchase authorization previously approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company currently has a total of approximately 2.7 million shares available for repurchase under the authorization. The 10b5-1 share purchase period will commence on Tuesday, August 22, 2006. Purchases will be transacted by a broker and will be based upon the guidelines and parameters of the 10b5-1 plan. The aggregate amount of shares purchased pursuant to the plan will not exceed one million shares. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the share repurchase program. Repurchased shares would be returned to the status of authorized, but unissued common shares. Conference Call The Company will conduct an earnings conference call and webcast on Friday, August 18, 2006, at 8:30 a.m. E.T. The webcast, as well as a replay in downloadable MP3 format, can be accessed from the Company's website at www.smuckers.com.
