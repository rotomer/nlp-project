Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS ORRVILLE, Ohio, Nov. 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the second quarter ended October 31, 2006, of its 2007 fiscal year. Second Quarter Results Three months ended October 31, ---------------------------- % Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) ------------ ------------- ------------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 605.0 $ 606.3 -- Net income: Income $ 45.6 $ 46.4 (2)% Income per common share $ 0.80 $ 0.79 1% Net sales increased 4 percent in the quarter, excluding the Canadian nonbranded, grain-based foodservice and industrial businesses sold in September 2006 and the U.S. industrial ingredient business ("divested businesses"). Growth in the Smucker's (R), Jif(R), and Crisco(R) brands as well as strong performance across the special markets segment resulted in the increase. Higher sales, in addition to a reduction in merger and integration costs, lower selling, distribution, and administrative expenses, and a decrease in shares outstanding, more than offset increases in raw material costs, and resulted in higher earnings per share for the quarter. Results for last year's second quarter include a favorable adjustment of approximately $6.7 million to net sales and margins, and approximately $4.3 million after-tax to earnings, or $0.07 per diluted share, reflecting a change in estimate of the expected liability for trade merchandising programs ("trade merchandising adjustment"). Net income for the second quarter of 2007 included pretax restructuring charges of $2.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, while net income for the second quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $4.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $2.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share would have been $0.83 in the second quarter of 2007, and $0.86 in the second quarter of 2006, including the trade merchandising adjustment of $6.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. "Our brands experienced sales and share of market growth for the quarter as we completed a successful Back-to-School campaign, and Fall Bake is off to a good start," commented Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "Consumers are responding to our brands, and new products enhance our growth prospects. Despite escalating raw material costs, we delivered earnings growth consistent with our sales growth. We expect this difficult cost environment to continue, and we remain focused on taking actions to mitigate these costs."
Six-Month Results Six months ended October 31, ---------------------------- % Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) ------------ ------------- ------------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 1,131.5 $ 1,116.6 1% Net income: Income $ 74.3 $ 76.3 (3)% Income per common share $ 1.30 $ 1.30 -- Net sales were up 4 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2007 over 2006 after excluding divested businesses. Net income for the first six months of 2007 included pretax restructuring charges of $10.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, primarily related to the divestiture of the grain-based Canadian operations. Net income for the comparable period in 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $7.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $3.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share would have been $1.42 in the first six months of both years. The trade merchandising adjustment of $6.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, was included in the first six months of 2006. The Company uses income and income per diluted share, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, the presentation of results excluding such charges is consistent with the way management internally evaluates its businesses, facilitates the comparison of past and present operations, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income for the current quarter and six-month period is included in the "Financial Highlights" table. Margins Three months ended Six months ended October 31, October 31, -------------------- -------------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 -------- -------- -------- -------- (% of net sales) Gross profit 31.6% 33.6% 30.9% 33.0% Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses 19.2% 19.8% 19.8% 20.7% Operating profit 12.3% 12.8% 10.9% 11.4% The favorable impact of the trade merchandising adjustment included in the prior year, and the increase in restructuring costs in the current quarter compared to last year, accounted for over one-half of the decline in gross margin. The remaining decline this quarter was primarily due to higher manufacturing expense and increased raw material costs, primarily soybean oil, wheat, and certain fruits. Freight related costs were also up over the prior year. The Company continues to take pricing actions to offset a portion of the increased input costs. Due to the timing of these pricing actions, current cost increases have not been fully offset. Selling, distribution, and administrative ("SD&A") expenses decreased 3 percent during the second quarter, and declined from 19.8 percent of net sales to 19.2 percent, primarily due to lower marketing and distribution expenses, compared to the same period last year. Also during the quarter, the Company sold its Farmhouse(R) brand of rice and pasta side dishes, which was acquired as part of the International Multifoods acquisition. The divestiture resulted in a write off of intangible assets of approximately $1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which was charged to amortization expense and included in SD&A.
Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market U.S. retail market segment sales for the quarter were up 3 percent, excluding the trade merchandising adjustment, with the sales in the consumer strategic business area up 5 percent and sales in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area essentially flat. Increases in the consumer strategic business area were led by gains in fruit spreads, toppings, peanut butter, and Uncrustables(R). In the consumer oils and baking strategic business area, sales gains were offset by a decline in industrial oil sales and the continued exit of certain less profitable customers. For the first six months, sales in the consumer strategic business area were up 6 percent, and sales in the oils and baking strategic business area declined 2 percent. Special Markets Sales in the second quarter for the special markets segment, excluding divested businesses, increased 12 percent. All strategic business areas in special markets were up with the international business area up 17 percent, beverage up 16 percent, foodservice up 10 percent, and Canada up 11 percent. The increase in Canada was driven by the acquisition of the Five Roses(R) flour brand earlier in the year, the impact of favorable exchange rates, and growth in condiments and fruit spreads. Outlook The Company remains committed to its long-term sales growth goal of 8 percent, one-half of which is to come from its core business and new products, and the remainder from acquisitions. Long-term earnings per share growth would be in line with sales growth. The Company confirms its fiscal 2007 outlook. The Company expects 2007 sales to increase by 4 percent over last year, excluding approximately $100 million in sales related to the divestiture of the Canadian nonbranded, grain- based foodservice and industrial businesses. The Company expects income per common share for the year to increase in line with the core growth assumption of 4 percent from fiscal 2006 income per common share of $2.65 which excludes restructuring and integration costs, the gain on the sale of the Company's Salinas, California, plant, and nonrecurring tax benefits.
