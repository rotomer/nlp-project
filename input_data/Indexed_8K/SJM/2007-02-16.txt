Exhibit 99.1 THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS ORRVILLE, Ohio, Feb. 16 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the third quarter ended January 31, 2007, of its 2007 fiscal year. Third Quarter Results Three months ended January 31, ----------------------- % Increase 2007 2006 (Decrease) ---------- ---------- ---------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 523.1 $ 536.5 (2)% Net income: Income $ 40.4 $ 31.3 29% Income per common share $ 0.71 $ 0.54 31% Net sales increased 6 percent in the third quarter, excluding the Canadian nonbranded, grain-based foodservice and industrial businesses sold in September 2006 and the U.S. industrial ingredient business ("divested businesses"). Growth in the Smucker's(R), Jif(R), and Crisco(R) brands, strong performance across the special markets segment, and the contribution of previously acquired brands resulted in the increase. Higher sales, gross margin improvements, a reduction in restructuring and merger and integration costs, a lower effective tax rate, and a decrease in shares outstanding, all contributed to an increase in earnings per share for the quarter. Net income for the third quarter of 2007 included pretax restructuring charges of $0.5 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, while net income for the third quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $7.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $5.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share would have been $0.72 in the third quarter of 2007, and $0.68 in the third quarter of 2006. Included in last year's third quarter earnings was a pretax gain of $5.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to the sale of the Company's Salinas, California, facility. The Company's operations also generated substantial levels of cash during the quarter. Cash from operations for the third quarter of 2007 was $104.6 million of which $15.3 million was used to repurchase 322,000 common shares, including shares repurchased to complete the previously announced Rule 10b5-1 plan. "We achieved good results for the quarter with sales growth and share of market gains across most of our brands," commented Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "Earnings grew at an even stronger rate, despite escalating raw material costs, as we are realizing the benefits of previous actions we have taken to offset cost increases and improve our overall profitability. We expect the cost environment to remain difficult and we will continue to take actions to mitigate the cost increases."
Nine-Month Results Nine months ended January 31, ----------------------- % Increase 2007 2006 (Decrease) ---------- ---------- ---------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 1,654.5 $ 1,653.0 -- Net income: Income $ 114.7 $ 107.7 7% Income per common share $ 2.01 $ 1.83 10% Net sales were up 5 percent for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 over 2006 after excluding divested businesses. Net income for the first nine months of 2007 included pretax restructuring charges of $11.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the divestiture of the grain-based Canadian operations. Net income for the comparable period in 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $14.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $9.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share would have been $2.14 for the first nine months of 2007, and $2.09 for the first nine months of 2006. The Company uses income and income per diluted share, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, the presentation of results excluding such charges is consistent with the way management internally evaluates its businesses, facilitates the comparison of past and present operations, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income for the current quarter and nine-month period is included in the "Unaudited Financial Highlights" table. Margins The increase in operating margin was primarily due to improvements in gross margin. The impact of the Canadian divestiture earlier in the year, combined with favorable product mix, accounted for the majority of the improvement in gross margin. Pricing actions taken to date have also contributed to margin improvement. The Company continues to incur high commodity costs impacting both raw material and freight and continues to take pricing actions to offset a portion of the increased costs. Due to the timing of these pricing actions, all cost increases have not been fully offset. Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to higher marketing and administrative expenses compared to the same period last year. Distribution expenses decreased from the prior year.
Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market U.S. retail market segment sales for the quarter were up 5 percent, with sales in the consumer strategic business area up 4 percent and sales in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area up 5 percent. Increases in the consumer strategic business area were led by gains in peanut butter, fruit spreads, toppings, and Uncrustables(R). In the consumer oils and baking strategic business area, sales gains in retail oils, frostings, baking ingredients, and the contribution of the White Lily(R) brand acquired earlier in the year offset declines in sales of industrial oils and baking mixes. For the first nine months, sales in the consumer strategic business area were up 5 percent, and sales in the oils and baking strategic business area were flat. Special Markets Sales in the third quarter for the special markets segment, excluding divested businesses, increased 11 percent. All strategic business areas in special markets were up with foodservice up 15 percent, Canada up 10 percent, beverage up 8 percent, and international up 15 percent. Increased sales of traditional portion control products, as well as increases in Uncrustables in the schools market contributed to the foodservice improvement. The increase in Canada was driven by the acquisition of the Five Roses(R) flour brand earlier in the year, the impact of favorable exchange rates, and growth in pickles and relishes. Outlook The Company remains committed to its long-term sales growth goal of 8 percent, one-half of which is to come from its core business and new products, and the remainder from acquisitions. Long-term earnings per share growth would be in line with sales growth. The Company expects 2007 sales to increase by approximately 4 percent over last year, excluding approximately $100 million in sales related to the divestiture of the Canadian nonbranded, grain-based foodservice and industrial businesses. Although the cost environment continues to be challenging, the Company's goal remains to increase income per common share for the year in line with the core growth assumption of 4 percent from fiscal 2006 income per common share of $2.65, which excludes restructuring and merger and integration costs, the gain on the sale of the Company's Salinas, California, plant, and nonrecurring tax benefits.
