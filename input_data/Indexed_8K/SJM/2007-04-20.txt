The Restricted Stock covered by ---------------------------- this Agreement shall be issued to the Grantee effective upon the Date of Grant. The Common Shares subject to this grant of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the Grantee's name and shall be fully paid and nonassessable.

The Common Shares subject ---------------------------------- to this grant of Restricted Stock may not be sold, exchanged, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of by the Grantee, except to the Company, unless the Restricted Stock has become nonforfeitable as provided in Section 3 hereof; provided, however, that the Grantee's rights with respect to such Common Shares may be transferred by will or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution. Any purported transfer or encumbrance in violation of the provisions of this Section 2 of this Article II shall be void, and the other party to any such purported transaction shall not obtain any rights to or interest in such Common Shares. The Company in its sole discretion, when and as permitted by the Plan, may waive the restrictions on transferability with respect to all or a portion of the Common Shares subject to this grant of Restricted Stock.
3. Vesting of Restricted Stock. --------------------------- (a) All of the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement shall become nonforfeitable on the fourth anniversary of the Date of Grant if the Grantee shall have remained in the continuous employ of the Company or a Subsidiary during that four-year period. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(a) of this Article II, all of the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement shall immediately become nonforfeitable (i) if the Grantee dies or becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary during the four-year period from the Date of Grant, (ii) if, at any time during the four-year period from the Date of Grant, the Grantee is age 60 with at least ten years of service with the Company, or (iii) if a Change in Control occurs during the four-year period from the Date of Grant while the Grantee is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3(a) of this Article II, if the Grantee leaves the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary within four years from the Date of Grant under circumstances determined by the Committee to be for the convenience of the Company, the Committee may, when and as permitted by the Plan, determine that all of the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement shall become nonforfeitable. 4. Forfeiture of Shares. The Restricted Stock shall be forfeited, -------------------- except as otherwise provided in Section 3 above, if the Grantee ceases to be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary prior to four years from the Date of Grant or in the event the Board determines the Grantee has engaged in Detrimental Activity as such term is defined in the Plan. In the event of a forfeiture, any certificate(s) representing the Restricted Stock or any evidence of direct registration representing the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement shall be cancelled. 5. Dividend, Voting and Other Rights. (a) Except as otherwise --------------------------------- provided herein, from and after the Date of Grant, the Grantee shall have all of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement, including the right to vote such Restricted Stock and receive any dividends that may be paid thereon; provided, however, that any additional Common Shares or other securities that the Grantee may become entitled to receive pursuant to a stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, separation, or reorganization or any other change in the capital structure of the Company shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement. (b) Cash dividends on the Restricted Stock covered by this Agreement shall be paid to the Grantee pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and reported on the Grantee's annual wage and tax statement (Form W-2) as compensation. 6.

ARTICLE III GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. Compliance with Law. The Company shall make reasonable efforts ------------------- to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws; provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement if the issuance thereof would result in a violation of any such law. 2. Withholding Taxes. To the extent that the Company or any ----------------- Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local or foreign tax in connection with any delivery of Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement, and the amounts available to the Company or such Subsidiary are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such delivery that the Grantee make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or such Subsidiary for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld. This tax withholding obligation may be satisfied by the Company electing to withhold Common Shares otherwise deliverable pursuant to this award in order to satisfy the minimum tax withholding amount permissible under the method that results in the least amount withheld. 3.
