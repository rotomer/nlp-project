     On May 31, 2007, The J. M. Smucker Company (the "Company") issued $400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.55% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Notes") to certain institutional investors in a private placement pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement"), by and among the Company and the purchasers party thereto. The Notes rank equal with all other senior unsecured debt of the Company.
     The Agreement contains customary covenants that require compliance with certain financial covenants and limit the Company's ability, among other things, to incur liens on assets, merge or consolidate with other persons, transfer or sell a substantial part of its assets, substantially change the nature of its business or enter into transactions with affiliates. The Agreement also contains events of default, customary for such financings, the occurrence of which will permit the holders of the Notes to accelerate the amounts due thereunder. Holders of the Notes will also have the option to require the Company to prepay the Notes upon a change in control of the Company.
     The Company may prepay at any time all or part of the Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, plus any applicable make-whole amount. The Company is required to prepay $50,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is then outstanding) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes on each of April 1, 2013 and April 1, 2014, and $75,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is then outstanding) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes on April 1, 2016. On April 1, 2017 and each April 1 thereafter, the Company is required to prepay $37,500,000 (or such lesser amount as is then outstanding) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. These mandatory prepayments are at par and without payment of a make-whole amount. The amounts of the mandatory prepayments are also propotionally reduced by any optional prepayments made by the Company.
     A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes was used to repay short-term debt under the revolving credit facility used in financing the Eagle Family Foods Holdings, Inc. acquisition on May 1, 2007. Additional proceeds will be used to finance other strategic and long-term business initiatives as determined by the Company.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
