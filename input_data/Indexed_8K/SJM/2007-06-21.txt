The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings ORRVILLE, Ohio, June 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 30, 2007. Fourth Quarter Results Three months ended April 30, % Increase 2007 2006 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 493.5 $ 501.7 (2%) Net income: Income $ 42.5 $ 35.7 19% Income per diluted share $ 0.75 $ 0.62 21% Net sales increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter, excluding the Canadian nonbranded, grain-based foodservice and industrial businesses sold in September 2006 and the U.S. industrial ingredient business ("divested businesses"). Growth in the quarter was led by the Jif(R), Smucker's(R), and Pillsbury(R) brands, strong performance in the foodservice strategic business area, and the contribution of brands acquired earlier in the fiscal year. Due to a temporary interruption of supply in the market adding to demand for the Company's products, peanut butter had a particularly strong quarter. Higher net sales, gross margin improvements, and a reduction in merger and integration costs, all contributed to an increase in net income per diluted share for the quarter. Net income per diluted share for the quarter was $0.75, a 21 percent increase over last year's fourth quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 included pretax merger and integration costs and restructuring charges of less than $0.01 per diluted share, while net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $3.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share was $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2007, and $0.68 in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reduced its effective tax rate for the year, resulting in a nonrecurring tax benefit in the quarter of $0.06 per diluted share. "We achieved record earnings for the quarter and the year, with solid growth across most of our brands," commented Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. "We had a strong finish to the year and have good momentum as we enter our new year. In addition, we recently completed the acquisition of Eagle Family Foods, the largest producer of canned milk in North America, and look forward to the addition of Eagle Brand(R) to expand our presence in the baking aisle, providing additional joint merchandising opportunities." "We continue to benefit from the focused execution of our strategy - refining our portfolio, spending behind our brands with marketing support and new product development, and investing in projects to improve our overall profitability," added Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "The cost environment remains challenging, and we will continue to take actions to mitigate cost increases. We will also invest in our businesses, maintaining our commitment to long-term, profitable growth."
Full Year Results Year ended April 30, %Increase 2007 2006 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 2,148.0 $ 2,154.7 -- Net income: Income $ 157.2 $ 143.4 10% Income per diluted share $ 2.76 $ 2.45 13% Net sales were up 5 percent for fiscal 2007 compared to 2006 after excluding divested businesses and net income per diluted share was up 13 percent in the same period. Net income for 2007 included restructuring charges of $12.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the divestiture of the Canadian nonbranded businesses. Net income for the comparable period in 2006 included pretax merger and integration costs of $17.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and restructuring charges of $10.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share was $2.89 for 2007, and $2.77 for 2006. The Company's operations also generated substantial levels of cash during the year. Cash from operations in 2007 was $273.4 million, an increase of $74.7 million over 2006. The Company uses income and income per diluted share, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, the presentation of results excluding such charges is consistent with the way management internally evaluates its businesses, facilitates the comparison of past and present operations, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income for the current quarter and fiscal year is included in the "Unaudited Financial Highlights" table. Margins Three months ended Year ended April 30, April 30, 2007 2006 2007 2006 (% of net sales) Gross margin 36.5% 32.1% 32.7% 32.2% Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses 22.2% 20.8% 20.6% 20.3% Operating margin 14.1% 10.8% 12.0% 10.6% Operating income increased by $15.5 million, or 29 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. The impact of the Canadian divestiture earlier in the year, combined with favorable product mix mainly attributable to increased peanut butter sales, accounted for the improvement in gross margin. Pricing actions taken to date have also contributed to margin improvement. The Company continues to incur high commodity costs impacting both raw material and freight and continues to take pricing actions to offset a portion of the increased costs. Due to the timing of these pricing actions, all cost increases have not been fully offset. Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily due to higher selling and corporate administrative expenses which offset lower distribution expenses compared to the same period last year.
Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market U.S. retail market segment net sales for the quarter were up 8 percent, with net sales in the consumer strategic business area up 12 percent and net sales in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area up 2 percent. Increases in the consumer strategic business area were led by peanut butter, fruit spreads, toppings, and Uncrustables(R). In the consumer oils and baking strategic business area, sales gains in baking mixes and frostings, and the contribution of the White Lily(R) brand acquired earlier in the year offset declines in sales of oils. For the year, net sales in the consumer strategic business area were up 7 percent, and net sales in the oils and baking strategic business area were flat as a 3 percent sales increase in retail oils and baking were offset by declines in sales of industrial oils. Special Markets Net sales in the fourth quarter for the special markets segment, excluding divested businesses, increased 6 percent. A 21 percent increase in the foodservice strategic business area more than offset modest declines in the Canada, beverage, and international strategic business areas. Increased sales of traditional portion control products, as well as increases in Uncrustables in the schools market contributed to the foodservice improvement. For the year, net sales in the special markets segment, excluding divested businesses, increased 9 percent over the prior year, with all strategic business areas up. Financing On May 31, 2007, the Company issued $400 million in 5.55 percent Senior Notes due April 1, 2022. A portion of the proceeds from the notes was used to repay short-term debt under the revolving credit facility used in financing the Eagle Family Foods Holdings, Inc. acquisition on May 1, 2007. The remainder of the proceeds will be used to finance other strategic and long-term business initiatives. Outlook The Company remains committed to its long-term strategic net sales growth goal of 8 percent, one-half of which is to come from its core business and new products, and the remainder from acquisitions. Long-term strategic earnings per share growth would be in line with net sales growth. Looking forward, the Company expects raw material costs to increase significantly over 2007 levels. Despite these higher costs, the Company expects to increase income per diluted share in line with its long-term growth objective.
