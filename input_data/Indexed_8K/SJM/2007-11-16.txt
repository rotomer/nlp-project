For Immediate Release - --------------------- The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Second Quarter Results Quarterly Net Sales and Earnings Highest in Company's History ORRVILLE, Ohio, November 16, 2007--The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the second quarter ended October 31, 2007, of its 2008 fiscal year. Results for the quarter and six-month period ended October 31, 2007, include the operations of Eagle Family Foods Holdings, Inc. ("Eagle") which was acquired on May 1, 2007. Second Quarter Results Three months ended October 31, ------------------------- 2007 2006 % Increase ------------ ------------ ----------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 707.9 $ 605.0 17% Net income: Income $ 50.2 $ 45.6 10% Income per diluted share $ 0.87 $ 0.80 9% Net sales increased 23 percent in the second quarter, excluding the Canadian nonbranded, grain-based foodservice and industrial businesses sold in September 2006. The acquired Eagle businesses contributed $81.4 million in the quarter. Also contributing to growth in the quarter were the Smucker's(R), Jif(R), Pillsbury(R), and Uncrustables(R) brands, and strong performance across the special markets segment. The acquired Carnation(R) and White Lily(R) businesses and the impact of favorable exchange rates also added to net sales. Net sales growth more than offset higher raw material costs and interest expense, resulting in an increase in net income of 10 percent. Net income per diluted share for the quarter was $0.87, an increase of 9 percent compared to last year's second quarter. Net income for the second quarter of 2008 included restructuring and merger and integration costs of $0.04 per diluted share, while net income for the second quarter of 2007 included restructuring costs of $0.03 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share was $0.91 in the second quarter of 2008, and $0.83 in the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 10 percent. Page 1
"This quarter, we achieved the highest quarterly sales and earnings results in our history, despite an extremely challenging cost environment," commented Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. "This accomplishment is a tribute to our dedicated employees and we appreciate their efforts. As we look ahead, commodity cost pressures remain. We anticipate further price increases as we navigate the short-term volatility. Our strategy of owning and marketing leading North American food brands will continue to provide opportunities for long-term profitable growth." Six-Month Results Six months ended October 31, --------------------------- ---------- 2007 2006 % Increase ------------- ------------ ---------- (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 1,269.4 $ 1,131.5 12% Net income: Income $ 90.9 $ 74.3 22% Income per diluted share $ 1.58 $ 1.30 22% Net sales increased 20 percent in the first six months of 2008 compared to the first six months of 2007, excluding the Canadian nonbranded, grain-based foodservice and industrial businesses sold in September 2006. The acquired Eagle businesses contributed $124.9 million in the first six months of 2008. Net income per diluted share for the first six months of 2008 was $1.58, a 22 percent increase over last year's first six months. Net income for the first six months of 2008 included restructuring and merger and integration costs of $0.05 per diluted share, while net income for the first six months of 2007 included restructuring costs of $0.12 per diluted share. Excluding these costs in both years, the Company's income per diluted share was $1.63 in the first six months of 2008, and $1.42 in the first six months of 2007, an increase of 15 percent. The Company uses income and income per diluted share, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key performance measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, the presentation of results excluding such charges is consistent with the way management internally evaluates its businesses, facilitates the comparison of past and present operations, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income for the current quarter and six-month period is included in the "Unaudited Financial Highlights" table. Page 2
Margins Three months ended Six months ended October 31, October 31, ------------------ ------------------ 2007 2006 2007 2006 ------- ------- ------- ------- (% of net sales) Gross margin 30.9% 31.6% 31.9% 30.9% Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses 18.6% 19.2% 19.5% 19.8% Operating margin 11.9% 12.3% 12.0% 10.9% Operating income increased by $9.7 million, or 13 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2007 while decreasing from 12.3 percent to 11.9 percent of net sales. Although the quarter's gross margin benefited from the divestiture of the lower margin, nonbranded Canadian businesses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and improved Uncrustables profitability, the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly milk and wheat, resulted in the decrease from 31.6 percent of net sales to 30.9 percent. Selling, distribution, and administrative ("SD&A") expenses increased $15.3 million, or 13 percent, for the second quarter of 2008 compared to 2007, resulting from increased marketing, selling, and distribution expenses attributed primarily to the acquired Eagle business. Corporate overhead expenses increased at a lesser rate than sales resulting in an overall decrease in SD&A from 19.2 percent of net sales to 18.6 percent, offsetting the decline in gross margin. Interest Expense and Income Interest expense increased by $5.0 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007, resulting from the issuance of $400 million in senior notes in the first quarter of 2008, a portion of which was used to repay short-term debt used in financing the Eagle acquisition. The investment of excess proceeds resulted in an increase in interest income of $1.8 million during the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Page 3
Segment Performance U.S. Retail Market - ------------------ U.S. retail market segment net sales for the quarter were up 23 percent. Net sales in the consumer strategic business area increased 10 percent led by peanut butter, fruit spreads, and Uncrustables. Net sales in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area were up 38 percent. Excluding the contribution of $69.8 million from the acquired Eagle business, consumer oils and baking sales increased 3 percent as growth in baking mixes and frostings more than offset declines in oils. For the first six months of 2008, U.S. retail market segment net sales increased 21 percent compared to the first six months of 2007. Net sales in the consumer strategic business area increased 8 percent, and excluding the contribution of $108.0 million from the acquired Eagle business, sales in the oils and baking strategic business area increased 6 percent over the first six months of 2007. Special Markets - --------------- Net sales in the second quarter for the special markets segment, excluding divested Canadian businesses, increased 21 percent. Sales increased 34 percent in foodservice, 22 percent in Canada, and 8 percent in beverage. Excluding the contribution of the Eagle acquisition, foodservice sales were up 19 percent. Sales in Canada were up primarily due to the impacts of the acquired Eagle and Carnation canned milk businesses and favorable exchange rates. For the first six months of 2008, special markets segment net sales increased 18 percent compared to the first six months of 2007, excluding divested Canadian businesses. Page 4
