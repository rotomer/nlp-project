Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On June 4, 2008, The J. M. Smucker Company ("Smucker"), The Procter & Gamble Company ("P&G"), The Folgers Coffee Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G ("Newco"), and Moon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker ("Merger Sub"), entered into a definitive transaction agreement (the "Transaction Agreement") to merge the Folgers coffee business ("Folgers") into Smucker in an all-stock reverse Morris Trust transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion, including the assumption of an estimated $350 million of Folgers debt. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Newco, with Newco as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Smucker (the "Merger").
     In connection with the Transaction Agreement, on June 3, 2008, Smucker, P&G and Newco entered into a Separation Agreement (the "Separation Agreement"), pursuant to which P&G will, among other things, (1) transfer Folgers to Newco and Newco will assume from P&G certain liabilities associated with Folgers, (2) prior to the Merger, distribute to eligible holders of P&G common shares all of the outstanding shares of Newco common stock, either, in P&G's sole discretion, through a pro-rata dividend or an exchange offer, or a combination thereof, and (3) receive a cash dividend from Newco of approximately $350 million.
     Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, each share of Newco common stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable Smucker common share, which will result in the shareholders of Smucker prior to the Merger holding approximately 46.5% of Smucker's common shares and the shareholders of P&G holding approximately 53.5% of Smucker's common shares following the Merger, in each case on a fully diluted basis. In addition, the shareholders as of the record date of Smucker prior to the Merger will receive a special cash dividend of $5 per share.
     The Transaction Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the parties, including, among others, covenants (1) to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Transaction Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement and (2) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period.
     Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the transactions, the expiration or termination of any required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the effectiveness of certain filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), approval by Smucker's shareholders of the issuance of Smucker common shares in the Merger and the receipt by the parties of certain tax opinions.
     In connection with the transactions, P&G has entered into a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") with certain Smucker shareholders (the "Shareholders"), which provides, among other things, that the Shareholders will vote: (1) in favor of the issuance of Smucker common shares pursuant to the Merger and authorizing the transactions contemplated by the
 
Transaction Agreement; (2) against the approval of any action, agreement or proposal that would result in a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Smucker in the Transaction Agreement or that would delay or hinder the consummation of the Merger or the transactions or that would preclude fulfillment of a condition precedent under the Transaction Agreement to Smucker's, P&G's, Newco's or Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger or the transactions; and (3) against any action, agreement, or proposal made in opposition to or in competition with the issuance of Smucker common shares pursuant to the Merger and the consummation of the Merger, including any competing transaction or superior proposal. The Shareholders that are a party to the Voting Agreement are estimated to hold between 6% and 15% of Smucker's voting power.
     The foregoing descriptions of the Transaction Agreement, the Separation Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto, the Separation Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.2 hereto, and the Voting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     Documents filed by Smucker with the SEC can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Documents filed by Smucker with the SEC can also be obtained free of charge from Smucker upon written request to The J. M. Smucker Company, Shareholder Relations, Strawberry Lane, Orrville, Ohio 44667 or by calling (330) 684-3838.
     The Transaction Agreement contains representations and warranties that Smucker, on the one hand, and P&G, on the other hand, made to and solely for the benefit of each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contract between the parties to the Transaction Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the contract or contained in confidential disclosure schedules. Those disclosure schedules contain information that modify, qualify or create exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Transaction Agreement. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties (1) may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date and are modified, qualified and created in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules, (2) may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to shareholders, or (3) may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the Transaction Agreement rather than establishing matters as facts. For the foregoing reasons, the representations and warranties should not be relied upon as statements of factual information.

Without limiting or otherwise affecting the indemnity provisions of the Transaction Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause each other member of the Parent Group to, indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the defense costs for) and hold harmless the Folgers Indemnitees from and against, and will reimburse such Folgers Indemnitee with respect to, any and all Losses that result from, relate to or arise, whether prior to or following the Business Transfer Time, out of any of the following items (without duplication):

Indemnification By Parent
          (a) any Excluded Liability, including the failure of Parent or any other member of the Parent Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill, discharge and, to the extent applicable, comply with, in due course and in full such Liabilities; and
          (b) any breach by Parent or any other member of the Parent Group of any obligations to be performed by such Parties pursuant to this Agreement or the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement subsequent to the Business Transfer Time.
     . (a) . The amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to provide indemnification to or on behalf of any Indemnitee pursuant to or , as applicable, will be reduced (retroactively or prospectively) by any Insurance

Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered from unaffiliated third-parties (and excluding any captive insurance companies of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates) by or on behalf of such Indemnitee in respect of the related Loss (net of any corresponding increase in premium payments or other related increases in insurance expenses of the Indemnitee). The existence of a claim by an Indemnitee for monies from an insurer or against a third-party in respect of any indemnifiable Loss will not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing by an Indemnifying Party. Rather, the Indemnifying Party will make payment in full of the amount determined to be due and owing by it against an assignment by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party of the entire claim of the Indemnitee for Insurance Proceeds or against such third-party. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that no insurer or any other third-party will be (i) entitled to a "wind-fall" or other benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions or otherwise have any subrogation rights with respect thereto or (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.
          (b) In the absence of a Final Determination to the contrary and except for any post-Distribution interest, any amount payable by Folgers to Parent under this Agreement will be treated as occurring immediately prior to the Transactions, as an inter-company distribution, and any amount payable by Parent to Folgers under this Agreement will be treated as occurring immediately prior to the Transactions, as a contribution to capital. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to provide indemnification to or on behalf of any Indemnitee pursuant to or , as applicable, will be (i) decreased to take into account any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof) arising from the incurrence or payment of the relevant indemnified item, and (ii) increased to take into account any Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof) arising from the receipt of the relevant indemnity payment. Any indemnity payment hereunder will initially be made without regard to this and will be reduced or increased to reflect any applicable Tax benefit or Tax cost, as the case may be, within 30 days after the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof) realizes such Tax benefit or incurs such Tax cost by way of a refund, an increase in Taxes or otherwise. In the event of a Final Determination relating to the Indemnitee's (or an Affiliate's) incurrence or payment of an indemnified item and/or receipt of an indemnity payment pursuant to this , the Indemnitee will, within 30 days of such Final Determination, provide the other party with notice thereof and supporting documentation addressing, in reasonable detail, the amount of any reduction or increase in Taxes of the Indemnitee (or its Affiliate) resulting from such Final Determination, and the parties will promptly make any payments necessary to reflect the relevant reduction or increase in Tax liability.
