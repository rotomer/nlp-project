For Immediate Release
 
The J. M. Smucker Company Announces First Quarter Results
 
ORRVILLE, Ohio, August 14, 2008 --The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2008, of its 2009 fiscal year.
First Quarter Results
Net sales increased 18 percent in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008 as sales growth was broad-based with all major brands contributing. In addition, the
Carnation
,
Europes Best
and
Knotts Berry Farm
acquisitions contributed approximately $31 million in sales to the quarter. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales increased 12 percent.
The strength of the Companys brands made it possible to successfully implement the price increases necessary to offset rising commodity costs. While pricing was the primary driver of the sales increase, volume gains were realized in several categories including
Smuckers
fruit spreads and
Uncrustables
sandwiches,
Pillsbury
baking mixes and frostings, and
Hungry Jack
potatoes and pancakes. Volume declines were primarily limited to oils and peanut butter, which were anticipated, resulting in a net tonnage decrease of approximately 4 percent.
Net income per diluted share for the quarter was $0.77, an increase of 8 percent compared to last years first quarter. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2009 were restructuring and merger and integration costs of $0.05 per diluted share, while net income for the first quarter of 2008 included restructuring and merger and integration costs of $0.01 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs in both years, the Companys income per diluted share was $0.82 in the first quarter of 2009, and $0.72 in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 14 percent.
We delivered good sales and earnings growth this quarter, establishing momentum as we enter the Back-to-School and Fall Bake periods, commented Richard Smucker, president and co-chief executive officer. We are particularly pleased that we are experiencing sales growth across most of our brands despite taking significant price increases to offset record raw material costs. Our strategy of owning number one brands and supporting them with consistent investments in marketing and product innovation provides opportunities for continued long-term profitable growth.
We look forward to adding another number one brand with the merger of the Folgers coffee business into Smucker, added Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer. 
Folgers
will be our largest brand, with sales in excess of $1.5 billion, and builds on our center of the store focus. We expect the addition of
Folgers
to significantly increase cash flow and, combined with the substantial increase in our size and scale, provide a platform for future growth and enhance our long-term growth opportunities.
The Company uses income and income per diluted share, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Rather, the presentation of results excluding such charges is consistent with the way management internally evaluates its businesses, facilitates the comparison of past and present operations, and provides management a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income for the current quarter is included in the Unaudited Financial Highlights table.

Margins
The impact of price increases taken to date has offset higher raw material costs, predominantly soybean oil, peanuts and wheat, contributing to a $22 million increase in gross profit. While price increases contributed to the overall gross profit increase, the incremental dollars did not provide gross margin expansion, and gross margin declined from 33.1 percent to 31.3 percent. Other factors impacting gross margin were increased fuel costs, the loss of nonrecurring peanut butter sales, and unfavorable product mix. As expected, margins improved in the Eagle business compared to last year, helping to offset these other factors.
Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses increased 13 percent for the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, resulting primarily from increased marketing investment, and distribution and amortization expenses. However, most SD&A expenses, particularly corporate overhead, increased at a lesser rate than net sales resulting in an overall decrease in SD&A from 20.8 percent of net sales to 19.9 percent, providing some offset to the decline in gross margin.
Operating income increased 2 percent compared to the first quarter of 2008, and decreased from 12.5 percent to 10.8 percent of net sales. Restructuring and merger and integration costs were $3.2 million higher in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, reducing operating margin by 50 basis points. In addition, last years operating income included the gain on the sale of the industrial ingredient business in Scotland, benefiting last years first quarter operating margin by 30 basis points.

Other
The effective tax rate decreased to 33.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, from 36.1 percent in the comparable period in 2008. In the first quarter of 2008, the Companys divestiture of its industrial ingredient business in Scotland, and the resulting repatriation of foreign earnings had a negative impact on the effective tax rate.
Segment P
erformance
U.S. Retail Market
U.S. retail market segment net sales for the quarter were up 13 percent. Net sales in the consumer strategic business area increased 11 percent, with
Smuckers
fruit spreads, toppings and
Uncrustables
sandwiches,
Jif
and
Hungry Jack
all up. All major categories of the consumer business area were up in volume, except for peanut butter. Net sales in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area were up 15 percent, due to price increases taken over the course of fiscal 2008, and volume gains in baking mixes and frostings. These increases more than offset anticipated volume declines in oils.
Special Markets
Net sales in the first quarter for the special markets segment increased 34 percent. Net sales in the Canada strategic business area were up 79 percent, with the impact of the
Carnation
and
Europes Best
acquisitions, and favorable exchange rates contributing over two-thirds of the increase. Volume and pricing gains accounted for the remaining Canadian sales growth. Net sales increased 13 percent in the foodservice strategic business area, led by pricing, with the
Knotts Berry Farm
acquisition and volume growth in the schools channel also contributing. The beverage business area was up by 11 percent, primarily due to pricing.

Outlook
The Company confirmed its outlook for the year. The outlook includes the impact of its previously announced agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) to merge P&Gs Folgers coffee business with and into the Company. Assuming the transaction closes in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008, the Companys net sales are estimated to range from $3.8 to $4.0 billion and earnings per share, before one-time costs primarily associated with the transaction, are estimated to range from $3.45 to $3.50. Actual results for the year will depend on the final closing date of the transaction.
