For Immediate Release
The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Second Quarter Results
ORRVILLE, Ohio, November 21, 2008 The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the second quarter ended October 31, 2008, of its 2009 fiscal year.
 
Second Quarter Results
 
Net sales increased 19 percent in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. Net sales growth was broad based with all major brands and strategic business areas contributing. The
Carnation
,
Europes Best
and
Knotts Berry Farm
acquisitions contributed approximately $35.8 million in net sales to the quarter while the foreign exchange impact of the weakening Canadian dollar reduced net sales by approximately $8.2 million. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, net sales increased 15 percent.
Over the last year, the Company has implemented price increases necessary to offset rising costs. While pricing was the primary driver of the net sales increase, volume gains also contributed. Most categories experienced volume gains, including
Smuckers
 
fruit spreads,
Pillsbury
baking mixes and frostings,
Hungry Jack
potatoes and pancakes,
Eagle Brand
sweetened condensed milk, and
Crisco
shortening and oils, while declines were primarily limited to flour and industrial oils.

Net income per diluted share for the quarter was $0.94, an increase of 8 percent compared to last years second quarter. Included in net income for the second quarter of 2009 were restructuring and merger and integration costs of $0.08 per diluted share, while net income for the second quarter of 2008 included restructuring and merger and integration costs of $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs in both years, the Companys income per diluted share was $1.02 in the second quarter of 2009, and $0.91 in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of 12 percent.
The number of meals prepared and consumed at home, as recent market data indicate, continues to be trending upward in this challenging economic environment, and is currently at levels not seen since 1994, commented Tim Smucker, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer. Our brands are considered by many families to be essential items in any pantry, and we are well positioned to meet the needs of those consumers looking to do more for their families by enjoying meals together at home.
We are excited about the closing of the Folgers transaction, added Richard Smucker, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer. Folgers is an excellent fit with our strategy to own and market number one food brands in North America. Along with our
Smuckers
,
Jif
,
Crisco
,
Pillsbury
,
Eagle Brand
,
Hungry Jack
,
Robin Hood
and
Bicks
brands, the Folgers brands enhance our opportunities to meet our consumers needs as we focus on our consumer with the theme Meals Together, Memories Forever.
Six-Month Results
Net sales increased 19 percent in the first six months of 2009 compared to the first six months of 2008. Acquisitions contributed approximately $66.8 million of the increase. Excluding acquisitions net sales increased 13 percent.

Net income per diluted share for the first six months of 2009 was $1.71, an increase of 8 percent over last years first six months. Net income for the first six months of 2009 and 2008 included restructuring and merger and integration costs of $0.13 and $0.05 per diluted share, respectively. Excluding these costs in both years, the Companys income per diluted share was $1.84 in the first six months of 2009, and $1.63 in the first six months of 2008, an increase of 13 percent.
 
The Company uses income and income per diluted share, excluding restructuring and merger and integration costs, as key measures of results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Rather, the presentation of results excluding such charges is consistent with the way management internally evaluates its businesses, facilitates the comparison of past and present operations, and provides management a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to net income for the current quarter and six-month period is included in the Unaudited Financial Highlights table.
Margins
Overall, gross profit increased $24.9 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008, despite higher raw material costs for soybean oil, peanuts, wheat, fruit and, to a lesser extent, other commodities. Price increases taken to date along with the impact of recent acquisitions and plant operating efficiencies have offset these higher raw material costs and have contributed to the gross profit increase. However, the Companys hedging activities resulted in mark-to-market charges of approximately $24.4 million on nonqualifying commodity hedges reflecting the sharp decline in soybean oil and wheat commodity markets during the quarter. As a result, gross margin declined from 30.9 percent to 28.9 percent.

Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses increased 15 percent for the second quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, resulting primarily from increased marketing investment and distribution expenses. Most SD&A expenses, particularly selling and corporate overhead, increased at a lesser rate than net sales resulting in an overall decrease in SD&A from 18.6 percent of net sales to 17.9 percent, providing some offset to the decline in gross margin.
Operating income increased 3 percent compared to the second quarter of 2008 and decreased from 11.8 percent to 10.2 percent of net sales. Restructuring and merger and integration costs were $3.2 million higher in the second quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, reducing operating margin by 0.4 percentage points.
Segment Performance
 
U.S. Retail Market
U.S. retail market segment net sales for the quarter were up 19 percent, with pricing accounting for the majority of the increase. Net sales in the consumer strategic business area increased 16 percent, with
Smuckers
fruit spreads, toppings and
Uncrustables
sandwiches,
Jif
and
Hungry Jack
all up. All major categories of the consumer business area were up in volume except for peanut butter, which was flat. Net sales in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area were up 21 percent primarily due to the effect of price increases. Volume gains in baking mixes, frostings, shortening, canned milk, and retail oil also contributed to the improvement in net sales. These increases more than offset volume declines in flour and industrial oils.
For the first six months of 2009, U.S. retail market segment net sales increased 16 percent compared to the first six months of 2008 with net sales up 14 percent in the consumer strategic business area, and up 19 percent in the consumer oils and baking strategic business area.

U.S. retail market segment profit increased 1 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the first six months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 reflecting the mark-to-market adjustment which primarily impacted the U.S. retail market segment.
Special Markets
Net sales in the second quarter for the special markets segment increased 21 percent. Net sales in the Canada strategic business area were up 29 percent, with the impact of the
Carnation
and
Europes Best
acquisitions offsetting the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Pricing gains accounted for the remaining Canada net sales growth. Net sales increased in the foodservice, beverage, and international business areas by 12, 14, and 22 percent, respectively, with pricing the primary contributor. The
Knotts Berry Farm
acquisition also contributed to the foodservice business area increase. For the first six months of 2009, special market segment net sales increased 26 percent.
Special markets segment profit increased 27 percent for the quarter and 11 percent for the first six months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily resulting from the impact of recent acquisitions.
Financing Activities
During the quarter, the Company issued $400 million in Senior Notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.6 percent. A portion of the proceeds from the Notes was used to fund costs related to the Folgers merger including the payment of the $5 per share one-time special dividend, totaling approximately $274 million, on October 31, 2008. There was essentially no impact on interest expense for the quarter since the financing closed on October 23, 2008. In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Companys debt obligations increased by Folgers $350 million of LIBOR-based variable rate debt.
Outlook
The Company confirmed its outlook for the year. The outlook includes the addition of the Folgers coffee business, acquired from The Procter & Gamble Company, as of the acquisition date of November 6, 2008. The Company issued approximately 63.2 million common shares related to the transaction and now has approximately 118 million common shares outstanding. The Companys net sales for 2009 are estimated to range from $3.8 to $4.0 billion, in line with the original estimate, and income per diluted share, before restructuring and merger and integration cost, are estimated to range from $3.45 to $3.50. One time costs associated with the Folgers transaction, including amounts expected to be allocated to goodwill, are estimated at $100 to $125 million and will be incurred over the next 12 to 24 months.
