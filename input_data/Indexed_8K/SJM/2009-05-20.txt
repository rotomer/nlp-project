Exhibit 3.1
     We, Richard K. Smucker, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Jeannette L. Knudsen, Corporate Secretary, of The J. M. Smucker Company, an Ohio corporation (the ""), do hereby certify that pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Directors of the Company (the "") by the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company, the Directors at a meeting duly called and held on May 20, 2009 at which a quorum was present and acting throughout, adopted the following resolution to amend the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company pursuant to Section 1701.70(B)(1) of the Ohio Revised Code:
Company
Directors
     RESOLVED, that Division I-A of Article Fourth of the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company be, and it hereby is, amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
      There is established hereby a series of Serial Preferred Shares that shall be designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares (hereinafter sometimes called this "" or the "") and that shall have the terms set forth in this Division I-A.
Section 1.
Series
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares
      The number of shares of this Series shall be 1,500,000.
Section 2.
      a) The holders of record of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Directors in accordance with the terms hereof, out of funds legally available for the purpose, cumulative quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September, and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a ""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share or fraction of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share. Such quarterly dividend payments shall be in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 per share or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, plus 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend payable in Common Shares, or a subdivision of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise)), declared on the Common Shares since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share or fraction of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Section 3.
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
     Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares, unless (i) the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or (ii) the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares entitled to receive a
 
quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. No dividends shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares for any dividend period unless at the same time a dividend for the same dividend period, ratably in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for all Serial Preferred Shares of all series then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend. The Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 40 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
      The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares are not redeemable.
Section 4.
      (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company (hereinafter referred to as a ""), no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares, unless, prior thereto, the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall have received at least an amount per share equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase Price as defined in the Rights Agreement dated as of May 20, 2009, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as the same may be from time to time amended in accordance with its terms (which Purchase Price is $140.00 as of May 20, 2009), subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the Rights Agreement, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive at least an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common Shares (the "").
Section 5.
Liquidation
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares Liquidation Preference
     (b) In the event, however, that the net assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the amount of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Serial Preferred Shares, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares as to distribution of assets in Liquidation, all shares of this Series and of such other series of Serial Preferred Shares shall share ratably in the distribution of assets (or proceeds thereof) in Liquidation in proportion to the full amounts to which they are respectively entitled.
     (c) In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares were entitled immediately prior to such event pursuant to the proviso set forth in paragraph (a) above, shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (d) The merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or business of the Company, shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation for the purpose of this Section 5.
      The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall not be convertible into Common Shares.
Section 6.

     8. . All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange will, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its stock transfer agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in canceled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, will be canceled by it, and no Right Certificates will be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by the provisions of this Agreement. The Company will deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent will so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent will deliver all canceled Right Certificates to the Company, or will, at the written request of the Company, destroy such canceled Right Certificates, and in such case will deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company.

Company Covenants Concerning Securities and Rights
     (a) It will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued Preferred Shares or any Preferred Shares held in its treasury, a number of Preferred Shares that will be sufficient to permit the exercise pursuant to Section 7 of all outstanding Rights.
     (b) So long as the Preferred Shares (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, Common Shares and/or other securities) issuable upon the exercise of the Rights may be listed on a national securities exchange, or quoted on a quotation system, it will endeavor to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all securities reserved for issuance upon the exercise of Rights to be listed on such exchange, or quoted on such quotation system, upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.
     (c) It will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Preferred Shares (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, Common Shares and/or other securities) delivered (or evidenced by registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) upon exercise of Rights, at the time of delivery of the certificates for (or registration of) such securities, will be (subject to payment of the Purchase Price) duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable securities.
     (d) It will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges that may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates and of any certificates representing securities issued upon the exercise of Rights (or, if such securities are uncertificated, the registration of such securities on the stock transfer books of the Company); , , that the Company will not be required to pay any transfer tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depositary receipts representing (or the registration of) securities issued upon the exercise of Rights in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise, or to issue or deliver any certificates, depositary receipts or notices representing securities issued

upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax or charge has been paid (any such tax or charge being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax is due.
     (e) It will use its best efforts (i) to file on an appropriate form, as soon as practicable following the later of the Share Acquisition Date and the Distribution Date, a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights, (ii) to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing, and (iii) to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (B) the Expiration Date. The Company will also take such action as may be appropriate under, or to ensure compliance with, applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the exercisability of the Rights. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time after the date set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 9(e), the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file such registration statement and to permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company will issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. In addition, if the Company determines that a registration statement should be filed under the Securities Act or any state securities laws following the Distribution Date, the Company may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights in each relevant jurisdiction until such time as a registration statement has been declared effective and, upon any such suspension, the Company will issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights will not be exercisable in any jurisdiction if the requisite registration or qualification in such jurisdiction has not been effected or the exercise of the Rights is not permitted under applicable law.
     (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the later of the Share Acquisition Date and the Distribution Date the Company will not take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will eliminate or otherwise diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
     (g) In the event that the Company is obligated to issue other securities of the Company and/or pay cash pursuant to Section 11, 13, 14 or 24 it will make all arrangements necessary so that such other securities and/or cash are available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.
     10. . Each Person in whose name any certificate representing Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) is issued (or in which such securities are registered upon the stock transfer books of the Company) upon the exercise of Rights will for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) represented thereby on, and such certificate (or registration) will be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and all applicable transfer taxes) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the transfer books of the Company for the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) are closed, such Person will be deemed to have become the record holder of such securities on, and such certificate (or registration) will be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the transfer books of the Company for the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate will not be entitled to any rights of a holder of any security for which the Rights are or may become exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions, or to exercise any preemptive rights, and will not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.

Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number and Kind of Securities or Number of Rights
 
     (a) (i) In the event that the Company at any time after the Record Date (A) declares a dividend on the Preferred Shares payable in Preferred Shares, (B) subdivides the outstanding Preferred Shares, (C) combines the outstanding Preferred Shares into a smaller number of Preferred Shares, or (D) issues any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification and/or the number and/or kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date upon exercise of a Right, will be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time is entitled to receive upon payment of the Purchase Price then in effect the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the transfer books of the Company for the Preferred Shares were open, the holder of such Right would have owned upon such exercise (and, in the case of a reclassification, would have retained after giving effect to such reclassification) and would have been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification; , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of one Right. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both this Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13, the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) will be in addition to, and will be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13.

     (B) any Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person, directly or indirectly, (1) merges into the Company or otherwise combines with the Company and the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger or combination (other than in a transaction subject to Section 13), (2) merges or otherwise combines with any Subsidiary of the Company, (3) in one or more transactions (otherwise than in connection with the exercise, exchange or conversion of securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) transfers cash, securities or any other property to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in exchange (in whole or in part) for shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise obtains from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with or without consideration, any additional shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (otherwise than as part of a pro rata distribution to all holders of shares of any class of capital stock of the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries), (4) sells, purchases, leases, exchanges, mortgages, pledges, transfers or otherwise disposes (in one or more transactions) to, from, with or of, as the case may be, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (otherwise than in a transaction subject to Section 13), any property, including securities, on terms and conditions less favorable to the Company than the Company would be able to obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unaffiliated third party, (5) receives any compensation from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than compensation as a director or a regular full-time employee, in either case at rates consistent with the Company's (or its Subsidiaries') past practices, or (6) receives the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantage provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or
     (C) during such time as there is an Acquiring Person, there is any reclassification of securities of the Company (including any reverse stock split), or any recapitalization of the Company, or any merger or consolidation of the Company with any of its Subsidiaries, or any other transaction or series of transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not with or into or otherwise involving an Acquiring Person), other than a transaction subject to Section 13, which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing by more than 1%

then, and in each such case, from and after the latest of the Distribution Date, the Share Acquisition Date and the date of the occurrence of such Flip-in Event, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right, except as provided below, will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement at an exercise price per Right equal to the product of the then-current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the date of the occurrence of such Flip-in Event (or, if any other Flip-in Event shall have previously occurred, the product of the then-current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the date of the first occurrence of a Flip-in Event), in lieu of Preferred Shares, such number of Common Shares as equals the result obtained by (x) multiplying the then-current Purchase Price by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the date of the occurrence of such Flip-in Event (or, if any other Flip-in Event shall have previously occurred, multiplying the then-current Purchase Price by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the date of the first occurrence of a Flip-in Event), and dividing that product by (y) 50% of the current per share market price of the Class A Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) on the date of the occurrence of such Flip-in Event. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the first occurrence of a Flip-in Event, any Rights that are Beneficially Owned by (A) any Acquiring Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (B) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who becomes a transferee after the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, or (C) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee prior to or concurrently with the occurrence of a Flip-in Event pursuant to either (1) a transfer from an Acquiring Person to holders of its equity securities or to any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or (2) a transfer which the Directors of the Company have determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has the purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii), and subsequent transferees of any of such Persons, will be void without any further action and any holder of such Rights will thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. The Company will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but will have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or any other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder. Upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, no Right Certificate that represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) will thereafter be issued pursuant to Section 3 or Section 6, and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent that represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) will be canceled. Upon the occurrence of a Flip-over Event, any Rights that shall not have been previously exercised pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii) shall thereafter be exercisable only pursuant to Section 13 and not pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii).
     (iii) Upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, if there are not sufficient Common Shares authorized but unissued or issued but not outstanding to permit the issuance of all the Common Shares issuable in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) upon the exercise of a Right, the Directors of the Company will use their best efforts promptly to authorize and, subject to the provisions of Section 9(e), make available for issuance additional Common Shares or other equity securities of the Company having equivalent voting rights and an equivalent value (as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company) to the Common Shares (for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), ""). In the event that equivalent common shares are so authorized, upon the exercise of a Right in accordance with the provisions of Section 7, the registered holder will be entitled to receive (A) Common Shares, to the
equivalent common shares
 
extent any are available, and (B) a number of equivalent common shares, which the Directors of the Company have determined in good faith to have a value equivalent to the excess of (x) the aggregate current per share market value on the date of the occurrence of the most recent Flip-in Event of all the Common Shares issuable in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) upon the exercise of a Right (the "") over (y) the aggregate current per share market value on the date of the occurrence of the most recent Flip-in Event of any Common Shares available for issuance upon the exercise of such Right; , , that if at any time after 90 calendar days after the latest of the Share Acquisition Date, the Distribution Date and the date of the occurrence of the most recent Flip-in Event, there are not sufficient Common Shares and/or equivalent common shares available for issuance upon the exercise of a Right, then the Company will be obligated to deliver, upon the surrender of such Right and without requiring payment of the Purchase Price, Common Shares (to the extent available), equivalent common shares (to the extent available) and then cash (to the extent permitted by applicable law and any agreements or instruments to which the Company is a party in effect immediately prior to the Share Acquisition Date), which securities and cash have an aggregate value equal to the excess of (1) the Exercise Value over (2) the product of the then-current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one- hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the date of the occurrence of the most recent Flip-in Event (or, if any other Flip-in Event shall have previously occurred, the product of the then-current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right would have been exercisable immediately prior to the date of the occurrence of such Flip-in Event if no other Flip-in Event had previously occurred). To the extent that any legal or contractual restrictions prevent the Company from paying the full amount of cash payable in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Company will pay to holders of the Rights as to which such payments are being made all amounts which are not then restricted on a pro rata basis and will continue to make payments on a pro rata basis as promptly as funds become available until the full amount due to each such Rights holder has been paid.

     (b) In the event that the Company fixes a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Shares entitling them (for a period expiring within calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares (or securities having equivalent rights, privileges and preferences as the Preferred Shares (for purposes of this Section 11(b), "")) or securities convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares at a price per Preferred Share or equivalent preferred share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares) less than the current per share market price of the Preferred Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date will be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of Preferred Shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current per share market price and the denominator of which is the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which is in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration will be as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company, whose determination will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent. Preferred Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company will not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment will be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price will be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

     (c) In the event that the Company fixes a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of Preferred Shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, cash (other than a regular periodic cash dividend), assets, stock (other than a dividend payable in Preferred Shares) or subscription rights, options or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b)), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date will be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the current per share market price of the Preferred Shares (as determined
 
pursuant to Section 11(d)) on such record date or, if earlier, the date on which Preferred Shares begin to trade on an ex-dividend or when issued basis for such distribution, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company, whose determination will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, cash, assets or stock so to be distributed or of such subscription rights, options or warrants applicable to one Preferred Share, and the denominator of which is such current per share market price of the Preferred Shares; , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments will be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price will again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

(d) (i) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "" of Common Shares on any date will be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Common Shares for the 30 consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such date; , , that in the event that the current per share market price of the Common Shares is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Common Shares of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Common Shares payable in such Common Shares or securities convertible into such Common Shares (other than the Rights) or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Common Shares, and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price will be appropriately adjusted to take into account ex-dividend trading or to reflect the current per share market price per Common Share equivalent. The closing price for each day will be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated quotation system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated quotation system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Shares are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by such market then in use, or, if on any such date the Common Shares are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Common Shares selected by the Directors of the Company. If the Common Shares are not publicly held or not so listed or traded, or are not the subject of available bid and asked quotes, "" will mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company, whose determination will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.

If the current per share market price of the Preferred Shares cannot be determined in the manner provided above, the "" of the Preferred Shares will be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to the current per share market price of the Common Shares multiplied by one hundred (as such number may be appropriately adjusted to reflect events such as stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar transactions relating to the Common Shares occurring after the date of this Agreement). If neither the Common Shares nor the Preferred Shares are publicly held or so listed or traded, or the subject of available bid and asked quotes, "" of the Preferred Shares will mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company, whose determination will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent. For all purposes of this Agreement, the current per share market price of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share will be equal to the current per share market price of one Preferred Share divided by one hundred.

Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 will be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment and (ii) the Expiration Date.
     (f) If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a), the holder of any Right thereafter exercised becomes entitled to receive any securities of the Company other than Preferred Shares, thereafter the number and/or kind of such other securities so receivable upon exercise of any Right (and/or the Purchase Price in respect thereof) will be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Shares (and the Purchase Price in respect thereof) contained in this Section 11, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect to the Preferred Shares (and the Purchase Price in respect thereof) will apply on like terms to any such other securities (and the Purchase Price in respect thereof).
     (g) All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder will evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
     (h) Unless the Company has exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 11(b) or Section 11(c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment will thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share (calculated to the nearest one one-millionth of a Preferred Share) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable upon exercise of a Right immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
     (i) The Company may elect, on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price, to adjust the number of Rights in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one one- hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights will be exercisable for the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights will become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company will make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. Such record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, will be at least 10 calendar days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company will, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to the provisions of Section 14, the additional Rights to which such holders are entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, will cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders are entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed will be issued, executed, and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and will be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
     (j) Without respect to any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and/or the number and/or kind of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number and kind of securities which were expressed in the initial Right Certificate issued hereunder.
 
     (k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below one one-hundredth of the then par value, if any, of the Preferred Shares or below the then par value, if any, of any other securities of the Company issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Preferred Shares or such other securities, as the case may be, at such adjusted Purchase Price.
     (l) In any case in which this Section 11 otherwise requires that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date the number of Preferred Shares or other securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the number of Preferred Shares or other securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , , that the Company delivers to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional Preferred Shares or other securities upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

     (m) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that in its good faith judgment the Directors of the Company determine to be advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Shares, (ii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Shares at less than the current per share market price therefor, (iii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Shares, (iv) stock dividends, or (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Shares is not taxable to such shareholders.
     (n) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company at any time after the Record Date prior to the Distribution Date (i) pays a dividend on the outstanding Common Shares payable in Common Shares, (ii) subdivides the outstanding Common Shares, (iii) combines the outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the outstanding Common Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), the number of Rights associated with each Common Share then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter but prior to the Distribution Date, will be proportionately adjusted so that the number of Rights thereafter associated with each Common Share following any such event equals the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights associated with each Common Share immediately prior to such event by a fraction the numerator of which is the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and the denominator of which is the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event. The adjustments provided for in this Section 11(n) will be made successively whenever such a dividend is paid or such a subdivision, combination or reclassification is effected.
     12. Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Section 11 or Section 13, the Company will promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares a copy of such certificate, and (c) if such adjustment is made after the Distribution Date, mail a brief summary of such adjustment to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 26. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be obligated or responsible for calculating any adjustment nor shall it be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

     (c) The Company will not consummate any Flip-over Event if, (i) at the time of or immediately after such Flip-over Event, there are or would be any rights, warrants, instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or arrangements in effect which would eliminate or substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, (ii) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such Flip-over Event, the shareholders of the Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the Issuer for purposes of Section 13(a) shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates or Associates, or (iii) the form or nature of the organization of the Issuer would preclude or limit the exercisability of the Rights. In addition, the Company will not consummate any Flip-over Event unless the Issuer has a sufficient number of authorized Common Shares (or other securities as contemplated in Section 13(b) above) which have not been issued or reserved for issuance to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior to such consummation the Company and the Issuer have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing for the terms set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 13 and further providing that as promptly as practicable after the consummation of any Flip-over Event, the Issuer will:
     (A) prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Rights and the securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to (1) become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and (2) remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the Expiration Date;
     (B) take all such action as may be appropriate under, or to ensure compliance with, applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the exercisability of the Rights; and
     (C) deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial statements for the Issuer and each of its Affiliates which comply in all respects with the requirements for registration on Form 10 under the Exchange Act.
     (d) The provisions of this Section 13 will similarly apply to successive mergers or consolidations or sales or other transfers. In the event that a Flip-over Event occurs at any time after the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, except for Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii), Rights that shall not have been previously exercised will cease to be exercisable in the manner provided in Section 11(a)(ii) and will thereafter be exercisable in the manner provided in Section 13(a).
     14. . (a) The Company will not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, the Company will pay as promptly as practicable to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights otherwise would be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of one Right is the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights otherwise would have been issuable. The closing price for any day is the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal quotation system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal quotation system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by such market then in use, or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Directors of the Company. If the Rights are not publicly held or are not so listed or traded, or are not the subject of available bid and asked quotes, the current market value of one Right will mean the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company, whose determination will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.
Fractional Rights and Fractional Securities
     (b) The Company will not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute
 
certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares or to register fractional Preferred Shares on the stock transfer books of the Company (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share). Fractions of Preferred Shares in integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it, that such agreement provides that the holders of such depositary receipts have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Shares represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, the Company may pay to any Person to whom or which such fractional Preferred Shares would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Preferred Share. For purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of one Preferred Share is the closing price of the Preferred Shares (as determined in the same manner as set forth for Common Shares in the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i)) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise; , , that if the closing price of the Preferred Shares cannot be so determined, the closing price of the Preferred Shares for such Trading Day will be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to the closing price of the Common Shares (determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i)) for such Trading Day multiplied by one hundred (as such number may be appropriately adjusted to reflect events such as stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or similar transactions relating to the Common Shares occurring after the date of this Agreement); , , that if neither the Common Shares nor the Preferred Shares are publicly held or listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, or the subject of available bid and asked quotes, the current market value of one Preferred Share will mean the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company, whose determination will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.

In lieu of issuing any such fractional securities, the Company may pay to any Person to whom or which such fractional securities would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one such security. For purposes of this Section 14, the current market value of one Common Share or other security issuable upon the exercise or exchange of Rights is the closing price thereof (as determined in the same manner as set forth for Common Shares in the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i)) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise or exchange; , , that if neither the Common Shares nor any such other securities are publicly held or listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, or the subject of available bid and asked quotes, the current market value of one Common Share or such other security will mean the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company, whose determination will mean the fair value thereof as will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.

The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 calendar days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares or the Common Shares by registered or certified mail. In the event the transfer agency relationship in effect between the Company and the Rights Agent (or its affiliate, Computershare Investor Services, LLC) terminates, the Rights Agent will be deemed to have resigned automatically and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement as of the effective date of such termination, and the Company shall be responsible for sending any required notice. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 calendar days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares by registered or certified mail,
Change of Rights Agent
 
and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first class mail. If the Rights Agent resigns or is removed or otherwise becomes incapable of acting, the Company will appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company fails to make such appointment within a period of 30 calendar days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who will, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, will be a corporation or other legal entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any state of the United States so long as such corporation is authorized to do business as a banking institution in such state, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus, including its Affiliates, of at least $50 million. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent will be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent will deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company will file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares or the Common Shares, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, will not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
     22. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price per share and the number or kind of securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale by the Company of Common Shares following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company (a) will, with respect to Common Shares so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise, exchange or conversion of securities (other than Rights) issued prior to the Distribution Date which are exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into Common Shares, and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary, appropriate or desirable by the Directors of the Company, issue Right Certificates representing an equivalent number of Rights as would have been issued in respect of such Common Shares if they had been issued or sold prior to the Distribution Date, as appropriately adjusted as provided herein as if they had been so issued or sold; , , that (i) no such Right Certificate will be issued if, and to the extent that, in its good faith judgment the Directors of the Company determine that the issuance of such Right Certificate could have a material adverse tax consequence to the Company or to the Person to whom or which such Right Certificate otherwise would be issued and (ii) no such Right Certificate will be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment otherwise has been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.
Issuance of New Right Certificates.

however
     23. (a) Prior to the Expiration Date, the Directors of the Company may, at their option, redeem all but not less than all of the then-outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price at any time prior to the Close of Business on the later of (i) the Distribution Date and (ii) Share Acquisition Date. Any such redemption will be effective immediately upon the action of the Directors of the Company ordering the same, unless such action of the Directors of the Company expressly provides that such redemption will be effective at a subsequent time or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more specified events (in which case such redemption will be effective in accordance with the provisions of such action of the Directors of the Company).
Redemption.
     (b) Immediately upon the effectiveness of the redemption of the Rights as provided in Section 23(a), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price, without interest thereon. Promptly after the effectiveness of the redemption of the Rights as provided in Section 23(a), the Company will publicly announce such redemption and, within 10 calendar days thereafter, will give notice of such redemption to the holders of the then-outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Company; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice will not affect the validity of the redemption of the Rights. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided will be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. The notice of redemption
provided
however
 
mailed to the holders of Rights will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, Common Shares (based upon the current per share market price of the Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) at the time of redemption), or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Directors of the Company (based upon the fair market value of such other consideration, determined by the Directors of the Company in good faith) or any combination thereof. The Company may, at its option, combine the payment of the Redemption Price with any other payment being made concurrently to holders of Common Shares and, to the extent that any such other payment is discretionary, may reduce the amount thereof on account of the concurrent payment of the Redemption Price. If legal or contractual restrictions prevent the Company from paying the Redemption Price (in the form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Directors) at the time of redemption, the Company will pay the Redemption Price, without interest, promptly after such time as the Company ceases to be so prevented from paying the Redemption Price.
     24. . (a) The Directors of the Company may, at their option, at any time after the Share Acquisition Date, exchange all or part of the then-outstanding and exercisable Rights (which will not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii)) for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the Record Date (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the ""). Any such exchange will be effective immediately upon the action of the Directors of the Company ordering the same, unless such action of the Directors of the Company expressly provides that such exchange will be effective at a subsequent time or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more specified events (in which case such exchange will be effective in accordance with the provisions of such action of the Directors of the Company). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Directors of the Company will not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company or any Related Person), who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the then-outstanding Common Shares.
Exchange
Exchange Ratio
     (b) Immediately upon the effectiveness of the exchange of any Rights as provided in Section 24(a), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and the only right with respect to such Rights thereafter of the holder of such Rights will be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Promptly after the effectiveness of the exchange of any Rights as provided in Section 24(a), the Company will publicly announce such exchange and, within 10 calendar days thereafter, will give notice of such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice will not affect the validity of such exchange. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided will be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange will be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii)) held by each holder of Rights.
provided
however
     (c) In any exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Company, at its option, may substitute for any Common Share exchangeable for a Right (i) equivalent common shares (as such term is used in Section 11(a)(iii)), (ii) cash, (iii) debt securities of the Company, (iv) other assets, or (v) any combination of the foregoing, in any event having an aggregate value, as determined in good faith by the Directors of the Company (whose determination will be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent), equal to the current market value of one Common Share (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the effectiveness of the exchange pursuant to this Section 24.
     25. . (a) If, after the Distribution Date, the Company proposes (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of Preferred Shares or to make any other distribution to the holders of Preferred Shares (other than a regular periodic cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of Preferred Shares rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional Preferred Shares or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Shares (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision of outstanding Preferred Shares), (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger into or with, or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of assets or earning power (including,

     (b) In case any Triggering Event occurs, then, in any such case, the Company will as soon as practicable thereafter give to the Rights Agent and each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which specifies the event and the consequences of the event to holders of Rights.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Distribution Date, a filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission shall constitute sufficient notice to the holders of any Rights or of any Common Shares for purposes of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A
     We, Richard K. Smucker, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Jeannette L. Knudsen, Corporate Secretary, of The J. M. Smucker Company, an Ohio corporation (the ""), do hereby certify that pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Directors of the Company (the "") by the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company, the Directors at a meeting duly called and held on May 20, 2009 at which a quorum was present and acting throughout, adopted the following resolution to amend the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company pursuant to Section 1701.70(B)(1) of the Ohio Revised Code:
Company
Directors
     RESOLVED, that Division I-A of Article Fourth of the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company be, and it hereby is, amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
      There is established hereby a series of Serial Preferred Shares that shall be designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares (hereinafter sometimes called this "" or the "") and that shall have the terms set forth in this Division I-A.
Section 1.
Series
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares
      The number of shares of this Series shall be 1,500,000.
Section 2.
      (a) The holders of record of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Directors in accordance with the terms hereof, out of funds legally available for the purpose, cumulative quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September, and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a ""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share or fraction of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share. Such quarterly dividend payments shall be in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 per share or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, plus 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend payable in Common Shares, or a subdivision of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise)), declared on the Common Shares since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share or fraction of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Section 3.
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
     (b) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares, unless (i) the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of
 
issue of such shares, or (ii) the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. No dividends shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares for any dividend period unless at the same time a dividend for the same dividend period, ratably in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor, shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for all Serial Preferred Shares of all series then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend. The Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 40 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
      The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares are not redeemable.
Section 4.
      (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company (hereinafter referred to as a ""), no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares, unless, prior thereto, the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall have received at least an amount per share equal to 100 times the then applicable Purchase Price as defined in the Rights Agreement dated as of May 20, 2009, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as the same may be from time to time amended in accordance with its terms (which Purchase Price is $140.00 as of May 20, 2009), subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the Rights Agreement, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive at least an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common Shares (the "").
Section 5.
Liquidation
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares Liquidation Preference
     (b) In the event, however, that the net assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the amount of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of Serial Preferred Shares, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares as to distribution of assets in Liquidation, all shares of this Series and of such other series of Serial Preferred Shares shall share ratably in the distribution of assets (or proceeds thereof) in Liquidation in proportion to the full amounts to which they are respectively entitled.
     (c) In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares were entitled immediately prior to such event pursuant to the proviso set forth in paragraph (a) above, shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (d) The merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or business of the Company, shall not be deemed to be a Liquidation for the purpose of this Section 5.
      The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares shall not be convertible into Common Shares.

EXHIBIT C
     On May 20, 2009, the Directors of The J. M. Smucker Company adopted a rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding common share, without par value (the ""). The dividend is payable on June 2, 2009 to our shareholders of record on that date. The terms of the rights and the rights plan are set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated as of May 20, 2009, as it may be amended from time to time, by and between The J. M. Smucker Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent.
common shares
     Our Directors adopted the rights plan to protect our shareholders from coercive takeover practices or takeover bids that are inconsistent with their best interests. In general terms, the rights plan imposes a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our outstanding common shares without the prior approval of our Directors. A person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of a percentage of our common shares in excess of that threshold is called an "." Any rights held by an acquiring person are void and may not be exercised. The term "" is defined in the rights plan and includes, among other things, certain derivative or synthetic arrangements having characteristics of a long position in common shares.
acquiring person
beneficial ownership
     This summary of rights provides a general description of the rights plan. Because it is only a summary, this description should be read together with the entire rights plan, which we incorporate in this summary by reference. We have filed the rights plan with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a registration statement on Form 8-A. Upon written request, we will provide a copy of the rights plan free of charge to any shareholder.
. Our Directors authorized the issuance of one right per each outstanding common share on June 2, 2009. If the rights become exercisable, each right would allow its holder to purchase from us one one-hundredth of a Series A Junior Participating Preferred Share for a purchase price of $140.00. Each fractional preferred share would give the shareholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one of our common shares. Prior to exercise, however, a right does not give its holder any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.
The Rights
. The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of:
Exercisability
We refer to the date that the rights become exercisable as the "." Until the distribution date, our common share certificates will also evidence the rights and will contain a notation to that effect. Any transfer of common shares prior to the distribution date will constitute a transfer of the associated rights. After the distribution date, the rights will separate from the common shares and be evidenced by right certificates, which we will mail to all holders of rights that have not become void.
distribution date
     . After the distribution date, if a person or group already is or becomes an acquiring person, all holders of rights, except the acquiring person, may exercise their rights upon payment of the purchase price to purchase our common shares (or other securities or assets as determined by our Directors) with a market value of two times the purchase price.
Flip-In Event
     . After the distribution date, if a flip-in event has already occurred and The J. M. Smucker Company is acquired in a merger or similar transaction, all holders of rights except the acquiring person may
Flip-Over Event
 
exercise their rights upon payment of the purchase price to purchase shares of the acquiring corporation with a market value of two times the purchase price of the rights.
     Rights may be exercised to purchase our preferred shares only after the distribution date occurs and prior to the occurrence of a flip-in event as described above. A distribution date resulting from the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer described in the second bullet point above could precede the occurrence of a flip-in event, in which case the rights could be exercised to purchase our preferred shares. A distribution date resulting from any occurrence described in the first bullet point above would necessarily follow the occurrence of a flip-in event, in which case the rights could be exercised to purchase common shares or other securities as described above.
. The rights will expire on the tenth anniversary of their distribution unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.
Expiration
. Our Directors may redeem all (but not less than all) of the rights for a redemption price of $0.001 per right (subject to adjustment) at any time before the later of the distribution date and the date of the first public announcement by The J. M. Smucker Company that a person or group has become an acquiring person. Once the rights are redeemed, the right to exercise rights will terminate, and the only right of the holders of rights will be to receive the redemption price.
Redemption
. After the later of the distribution date and the date of the first public announcement by The J. M. Smucker Company that a person or group has become an acquiring person, but before an acquiring person owns 50% or more of our outstanding common shares, our Directors may exchange each right (other than rights that have become void) for one common share or an equivalent security.
Exchange
. Our Directors may adjust the purchase price of the preferred shares, the number of preferred shares issuable and the number of outstanding rights to prevent dilution that may occur as a result of certain events, including among others, a stock dividend, a stock split or a reclassification of the preferred shares or our common shares. No adjustments to the purchase price of less than 1% will be made.
Anti-Dilution Provisions
. Before the time rights cease to be redeemable, our Directors may amend or supplement the rights plan without the consent of the holders of the rights, except that no amendment may decrease the redemption price below $0.001 per right. At any time thereafter, our Directors may amend or supplement the rights plan only to cure an ambiguity, to alter time period provisions, to correct inconsistent provisions or to make any additional changes to the rights plan, but only to the extent that those changes do not impair or adversely affect any rights holder and do not result in the rights again becoming redeemable. The limitations on our Directors' ability to amend the rights plan does not affect our Directors' power or ability to take any other action that is consistent with their fiduciary duties, including without limitation accelerating or extending the expiration date of the rights, making any amendment to the rights plan that is permitted by the rights plan or adopting a new rights plan with such terms as our Directors determine in their sole discretion to be appropriate.
Amendments

Exhibit 99.1
Orrville, Ohio, May 20, 2009  The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) announced today that its Board of Directors has adopted a new Shareholder Rights Plan (the "Plan"). The new Plan replaces the rights plan adopted by the Company in 1999. Under the new Plan, the Company will distribute rights as a dividend to its shareholders at the rate of one right for each common share held of record on June 2, 2009.
According to Tim Smucker, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, "The Company's Board of Directors today authorized the Plan after thoughtful and thorough analysis and consideration. The adoption of the Plan remains consistent with our Basic Belief of Independence."
Richard Smucker, the Company's Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer commented further, "Our Board of Directors and senior management continue to believe that the long-term interests of the Company and all of its constituents have been, and will continue to be, best served by the stewardship of the Company's family of leading icon brands by a management team led by the Smucker family."
Under the Plan, the rights will initially trade together with the Company's common shares and will not be exercisable. In the absence of further action by the Board of Directors, the rights generally will become exercisable and allow the holder to acquire common shares of the Company at a discounted price if a person or group (other than members of the Smucker family) acquires 10% or more of the Company's outstanding common shares. Rights held by persons who exceed that threshold will be void.
The Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all rights for $0.001 per right, generally at any time prior to the rights becoming exercisable. The rights will expire on June 2, 2019, unless earlier redeemed, exchanged, or amended.
The issuance of the rights is not a taxable event, will not affect the Company's reported financial condition or results of operations (including earnings per share), and will not change the manner in which the Company's common shares are currently traded.
