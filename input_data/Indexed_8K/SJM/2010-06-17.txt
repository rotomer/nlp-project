Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 15, 2010, The J. M. Smucker Company (the "Company") issued $400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (collectively, the "Notes") to certain institutional investors in a private placement pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") by and among the Company and the purchasers party thereto. J.M. Smucker LLC, an Ohio limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and The Folgers Coffee Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, are each guarantors of all of the obligations of the Company under the Agreement and the Notes. The Notes rank equal with all other senior unsecured debt of the Company.
The Agreement contains customary covenants that require compliance with certain financial covenants and limit the Company's ability, among other things, to incur liens on assets, merge or consolidate with other persons, transfer or sell a substantial part of its assets, substantially change the nature of its business or enter into transactions with affiliates. The Agreement also contains events of default, customary for such financings, the occurrence of which will permit the holders of the Notes to accelerate the amounts due thereunder. Holders of the Notes will also have the option to require the Company to prepay the Notes upon a change in control of the Company.
The Company may prepay at any time all or part of the Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, plus any applicable make-whole amount. The Company is required to prepay (or, with respect to the payment on the maturity date, repay) $100,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is then outstanding) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes on June 1, 2020, $75,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is then outstanding) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes on each of June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, and $50,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is then outstanding) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes on June 1, 2023 and on each June 1 thereafter to and including June 1, 2025. These mandatory prepayments are at par and without payment of a make-whole amount. The amounts of the mandatory prepayments are also proportionally reduced by any optional prepayments made by the Company. Interest on the unpaid principal balance is due and payable semi annually on the first day of June and December of each year.
The proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used for general corporate purposes as determined by the Company.
The foregoing is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Agreement and not a complete description of the Agreement. Accordingly, the foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Insurance Company General Account
(b)  the Source is a separate account:
Separate Account

Notice of Change in Control or Control Event
(b) . The Company will not take any action that consummates or finalizes a Change in Control unless

Proposed Prepayment Date
(d) . A holder of Notes may reject the offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.3 by causing a notice of such rejection to be delivered to the Company at least five Business Days prior to the Proposed Prepayment Date.

Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the date of prepayment with respect to such principal amount, together with interest on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment. Two Business Days preceding the date of prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes being prepaid a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of the Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such prepayment (for the avoidance of doubt, in respect of any prepayment to be made under this Section 8.3 the date of which has been deferred pursuant to Section 8.3(f) below, any calculation of accrued interest or Make-Whole Amount owing to the holders of the Notes to be prepaid shall be made with reference to the date such prepayment is actually made, rather than the original Proposed Prepayment Date in respect thereof). The prepayment shall be made on the Proposed Prepayment Date except as provided in Section 8.3(f).
Prepayment
(f) . The obligation of the Company to prepay Notes pursuant to the offers accepted in accordance with Section 8.3(d) is subject to the occurrence of the Change in Control in respect of which such offers and acceptances shall have been made. In the event that such Change in Control does not occur on or before the Proposed Prepayment Date in respect thereof, the prepayment shall be deferred until and shall be made on the date on which such Change in Control occurs. The Company shall keep each holder of Notes reasonably and timely informed of:
Deferral of Obligation to Purchase
(i) any such deferral of the date of prepayment;
(ii) the date on which such Change in Control and the prepayment are expected to occur; and
(iii) any determination by the Company that efforts to effect such Change in Control have ceased or been abandoned (in which case the offers and acceptances made pursuant to this Section 8.3 in respect of such Change in Control shall be deemed rescinded).
(g) . Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a Senior Financial Officer of the Company and dated the date of such offer, specifying:
Officer's Certificate
(ii) that such offer is made pursuant to this Section 8.3;

(vi) the interest that would be due on each Note offered to be prepaid, accrued to the Proposed Prepayment Date;
(vii) that the conditions of this Section 8.3 have been fulfilled; and
(viii) in reasonable detail, the nature and date or proposed date of the Change in Control.
In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2, the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.
In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8, the Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay, or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except pursuant to an offer to purchase (which offer may or may not include the Make-Whole Amount, if any, or any portion thereof) made by the Company or an Affiliate to the holders of all Notes at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions, provided that at the time such offer is made and after giving effect to such purchase, no Default or Event of Default shall exist. Any such offer shall provide each holder with sufficient information to enable it to make an informed decision with respect to such offer, shall contain a representation by the Company that no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist after giving effect to such proposed purchase of Notes, and shall remain open for at least ten Business Days. If the holders of more than 50% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding accept such offer, the Company shall promptly notify the remaining holders of such fact and the expiration date for the acceptance by holders of Notes of such offer shall be extended by the number of days necessary to give each such remaining holder at least ten Business Days from its receipt of such notice to accept such offer. The Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment or purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.
pro rata
The term "Make-Whole Amount" means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero.

Discounted Value
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by
Reinvestment Yield
(i) the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M.

(ii) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.
Such implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between (1) the actively traded on the run U.S. Treasury security with the duration closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the actively traded on the run U.S. Treasury security with the duration closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the Notes.
"" means, with respect to any Called Principal of any Note, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.
Remaining Average Life
"" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date.
Remaining Scheduled Payments

The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under the Guaranty Agreement to which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party shall at all times rank pari passu, without preference or priority, with all other outstanding, unsecured, unsubordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, present and future, that have not been accorded preferential rights.

No modification or amendment of any Primary Senior Debt that results in any Financial Covenant becoming less restrictive on the Company shall be effective as a modification, amendment or waiver under this Agreement. The Company further covenants promptly to execute and deliver at its expense (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel for the holders of the Notes) an amendment to this Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders to reflect such additional or more favorable Financial Covenant, provided that the execution and delivery of such amendment shall not be a precondition to the effectiveness of such additional or more favorable Financial Covenant as provided for in this Section 9.7.

If, notwithstanding the prohibition contained herein, the Company shall, or shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien, other than those Liens permitted by the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (g) of this Section 10.6, it will make or cause to be made effective provision whereby the Notes will be secured equally and ratably with any and all other obligations thereby secured, such security to be pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and, in any such case, the Notes shall have the benefit, to the fullest extent that, and with such priority as, the holders of the Notes may be entitled under applicable law, of an equitable Lien on such property. Such violation of this Section 10.6 will constitute an Event of Default, whether or not provision is made for an equal and ratable Lien pursuant to this Section 10.6.

(iii) immediately after giving effect to the Asset Disposition, the sum of the Disposition Values in respect of all property that was the subject of any Asset Disposition occurring in the period commencing with the first day of the Current Four Quarter Period and ending with and including the date of such Asset Disposition would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets as of the end of the then most recently ended fiscal year of the Company.

If the Company shall give written notice to the holders of the Notes prior to consummation of any Transfer that it intends to apply the Net Proceeds Amount arising therefrom to a Debt Prepayment Application or a Property Reinvestment Application within 365 days after such Transfer, then such Transfer, only for the purpose of determining compliance with subsection (iii) of this Section 10.7(a), shall be deemed not to be an Asset Disposition. If the Company shall fail to apply such Net Proceeds Amount as stated in such notice within such period, such failure shall constitute an Event of Default.

If the Company shall fail to apply such Net Proceeds Amount as stated in such notice within such period, such failure shall constitute an Event of Default.
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, engage in any business if, as a result, the general nature of the business in which the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would then be engaged would be substantially changed from the general nature of the business in which the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are engaged on the date of this Agreement as described in the Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2009.

(a) If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of such paragraph (g) or described in clause (vi) of such paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of such paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
(b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
(c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and payable.
Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.
If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.
At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the holders of not less than 75% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if (a) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15, the Company will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.
Whenever any Note shall be declared immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1 or any such declaration shall be rescinded or annulled pursuant to Section 12.3, the Obligors shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the holders of each Note at the time outstanding.
The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders of Notes.
Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or his attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall execute and deliver within five Business Days, at the Company's expense (except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be substantially in the form of such Note set forth in Exhibit 1. Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than $200,000, provided that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $200,000. Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have made the representation set forth in the last sentence of Section 6.1 and in Section 6.2.
Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and
(a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or an Institutional Investor, such Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or
(b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof,
the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver within five Business Days, in lieu thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.
Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in Orrville, Ohio at the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction. The Company may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall be either the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction.
So long as any Purchaser or its nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose opposite such Purchaser's name in Schedule A, or by such other method or at such other address as such Purchaser shall have from time to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, such Purchaser shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by any Purchaser or its nominee such Purchaser will, at its election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by such Purchaser under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as such Purchaser has made in this Section 14.2.
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company will pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees of a special counsel and, if reasonably required, local or other counsel) incurred by each Purchaser or holder of a Note in connection with such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of this Agreement, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Guaranty Agreement (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective), including, without limitation: (a) the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights under this Agreement, the Notes or any Guaranty Agreement as against any Obligor or in responding to any subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in connection with this Agreement, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Guaranty Agreement, or by reason of being a holder of any Note, and (b) the costs and expenses, including financial advisors' fees, incurred in connection with the insolvency or bankruptcy of any Obligor or any Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Notes. The Company will pay, and will save each Purchaser and each other holder of a Note harmless from, all claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of brokers and finders (other than those retained by any Purchaser).
The obligations of the Company under this Section 15 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.
All representations and warranties contained herein shall be deemed made at and as of the date of the Closing and shall speak only as of such date. The accuracy of such representations and warranties as at the date of the Closing shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer by any Purchaser or any holder of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of such Purchaser or any other holder of a Note. All statements contained in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the Company under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Guaranty Agreements embody the entire agreement and understanding among each Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.
This Agreement and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the Company and the Required Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 hereof, or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to any holder unless consented to by such holder in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the holder of each Note at the time outstanding, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or 20.
(a) . The Company will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with all information that the Company reasonably believes is sufficient, and all other information requested by any of the holders, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.
Solicitation
(b) . The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security or issue any guaranty, to any holder of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of Notes or any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security or guaranty is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.
Payment
(c) . Any amendment or waiver made pursuant to this Section 17.2 by a holder of Notes that has transferred or has agreed to transfer its Notes to the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate and has provided or has agreed to provide such amendment or waiver as a condition to such transfer shall be void and of no force and effect except solely as to such holder, and any amendments effected or waivers granted that would not have been or would not be so effected or granted but for such amendment or waiver (and the amendments or waivers of all other holders of Notes that were acquired under the same or similar conditions) shall be void and of no force and effect, retroactive to the date such amendment or waiver initially took or takes effect, except solely as to such holder.
Scope of Consent
Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Company without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term "" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.
this Agreement
Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

Each Noteholder may proceed to protect and enforce this Guaranty by suit or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy or insolvency, and whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in execution or aid of any power herein granted; or for the recovery of judgment for the obligations hereby guaranteed or for the enforcement of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy available under applicable law.
2.13. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If any Noteholder shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy against the Guarantor under this Guaranty or otherwise and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to such Noteholder, then and in every such case each such Noteholder, the Company and the Guarantor shall, except as may be limited or affected by any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to its respective former position hereunder, and thereafter the rights and remedies of such Noteholder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
2.14. Survival.
So long as the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid, the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall survive the transfer and payment of any Note and the payment in full of all the Notes.
2.15. Subordination.
The payment of any amounts due with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company or any other Person obligated in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such Indebtedness of the Company or any other such Person to the Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such Indebtedness while any Guaranteed Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Noteholders and be paid over to the Noteholders on account of the Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.

The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that each of the representations and warranties made by the Company as to the Company's Subsidiaries in the Note Purchase Agreement is true and correct as to the Guarantor.
3.2. Economic Benefit.
The Guarantor and the Company operate as separate businesses but are considered a single consolidated business group of companies for purposes of GAAP and are dependent upon each other for and in connection with their respective business activities and financial resources. The execution and delivery by the Noteholders of the Note Purchase Agreement and the maintenance of certain financial accommodations thereunder constitute an economic benefit to the Guarantor and the incurrence by the Company of the Indebtedness under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes is in the best interests of the Guarantor. The board of directors or other management board of the Guarantor has deemed it advisable and in the best interest of the Guarantor that the transactions provided for in the Note Purchase Agreement and this Guaranty be consummated.
3.3. Independent Credit Evaluation.
The Guarantor has independently, and without reliance on any information supplied by any one or more of the Noteholders, taken, and will continue to take, whatever steps the Guarantor deems necessary to evaluate the financial condition and affairs of the Company, and the Noteholders shall have no duty to advise the Guarantor of information at any time known to the Noteholders regarding such financial condition or affairs.
3.4. No Representation By Noteholders.
None of the Noteholders nor any trustee or agent acting on its behalf has made any representation, warranty or statement to the Guarantor to induce the Guarantor to execute this Guaranty.
3.5. Survival.
All representations and warranties made by the Guarantor herein shall survive the execution hereof and may be relied upon by the Noteholders as being true and accurate until the Guaranteed Obligations are fully and irrevocably paid.
The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that, so long as any part of the Guaranteed Obligations shall remain unpaid, the Guarantor will perform and observe, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to perform and observe, all of the terms, covenants and agreements set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement on its or their part to be performed or observed or that the Company has agreed to cause the Guarantor or such Subsidiaries to perform or observe.
The Guarantor further agrees, as the primary guarantor and not merely as a surety, to pay to the Noteholders, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable legal expenses) incurred or expended by the Noteholders in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, this Guaranty and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this Section 5 from the time when such amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the rate of interest for overdue principal set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount.

No failure by the Noteholders to exercise, and no delay by the Noteholders in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Noteholders of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
provided, however
