We continue to deliver solid earnings and sales growth in a dynamic consumer environment, commented Richard Smucker, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer.   These strong results reflect our disciplined approach to managing our business, the ongoing investments in the equity of our brands, and the benefit of a cultural commitment to making the highest-quality products.
Our team continues to drive results, including volume growth and strong cash flow which have enabled us to repurchase over three percent of outstanding shares and declare a 10 percent quarterly dividend increase, added Tim Smucker, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer. As we navigate through an uncertain commodity cost environment, we expect to continue to drive financial results by maintaining our balanced approach to pricing, market share growth, and profitability.
Net Sales
 
Net sales in the third quarter of 2011 increased $106.5 million, or 9 percent, compared to the third quarter of 2010, and increased 10 percent, excluding the impact of the 2010 potato products divestiture and foreign exchange.  Overall volume increased 3 percent as solid gains were realized in  oils,peanut butter, fruit spreads, packaged coffee, and natural foods beverages.  The net impact of pricing contributed approximately 4 percent to net sales and the overall impact of sales mix was favorable.

Gross profit increased $16.1 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, as the increase in net sales offset the impact of overall higher raw material costs and $16.9 million of special project costs included in cost of products sold.  Excluding special project costs, gross profit increased $33.0 million, or 7 percent, yet decreased as a percent of net sales from 38.0 percent in the third quarter of 2010, to 37.4 percent in the third quarter of 2011.  Raw material cost increases were most significant for green coffee, milk, sugar, and soybean oil, and more than offset lower costs for peanuts.  Coffee price increases taken earlier in the year offset higher green coffee cost and contributed to the gross profit increase in the third quarter of 2011, but did not result in an overall gross margin gain.  Gross margin was further impacted by price declines taken on oils during the second quarter in response to competitive dynamics.
Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2011, were flat compared to 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net sales from 17.8 percent to 16.3 percent.  Marketing and distribution expenses for the third quarter of 2011 both decreased 1 percent, compared to 2010, while selling expenses increased approximately 7 percent related to the increase in net sales.  General and administrative expenses decreased 3 percent over the same period.
Operating income increased $3.1 million, or 1 percent, in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, despite an overall increase in special project costs of approximately $23.3 million.  Excluding the impact of special project costs in both periods, operating income increased $26.4 million, or 12 percent, and improved from 17.8 percent of net sales in 2010, to 18.4 percent in 2011.  Additionally, noncash impairment charges of $17.2 million and $9.8 million, primarily related to the  intangible assets in Canada, reduced the Companys overall operating margin by 1.3 and 0.8 percentage points in the third quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Interest and Income Taxes
Interest expense increased $3.9 million during the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to higher average debt outstanding.
Income taxes increased $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.  The effective tax rate was 32.6 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and 31.3 percent in the third quarter of 2010.  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2011 was 32.2 percent, compared to 33.7 percent for the same period in 2010.
 
Segment Performance
 
 
 
While the Companys four reportable segments remain the same for 2011, the calculation of segment profit was modified at the beginning of 2011 to include intangible asset amortization and impairment charges related to segment assets, along with certain other items in each of the segments.  These items were previously considered corporate expenses and were not allocated to the segments.  This change more accurately aligns the segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, most notably in the area of intangible assets.  Fiscal 2010 segment profit has been recalculated to be consistent with the current methodology.

U.S. Retail Coffee Market
The U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment net sales increased 18 percent in the third quarter of 2011, compared to the third quarter of 2010.  Through the third quarter, price increases totaling 13 percent were taken during 2011 to cover rising green coffee costs.  The impact of these price increases, and favorable sales mix more than offset a 2 percent volume decline.  The introduction of  and offerings earlier in the fiscal year added approximately 4 percent to U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment net sales in the third quarter of 2011.  Volume decreased 3 percent for the  brand while  packaged coffee increased 8 percent in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.

U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment profit increased 19 percent in the third quarter of 2011, compared to the third quarter of 2010.  Green coffee costs were significantly higher in the third quarter of 2011, compared to the third quarter of 2010, but were offset by previously announced price increases and favorable sales mix.  Promotional spending was up for the third quarter of 2011 compared to 2010, but at an overall lower rate during the Fall Bake and Holiday period while marketing expenses decreased.  As a result, segment profit margin was 28.5 percent in 2011, compared to 28.1 percent in 2010.   The Company expects to recognize higher green coffee costs in the fourth quarter and, as a result, announced a 10 percent price increase in early February.
U.S. Retail
Consumer
Market
The U.S. Retail Consumer Market segment net sales increased 5 percent while volume increased 7 percent, excluding the effect of potato products divested in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Volume gains were realized in peanut butter,  fruit spreads, and pancake mixes and syrup.  Reported segment net sales were flat and volume increased 3 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2011, compared to the third quarter of 2010, reflecting the divested potato products.

The U.S. Retail Consumer Market segment profit increased 9 percent for the third quarter of 2011, compared to the third quarter in 2010, due to a decrease in supply chain and certain raw material costs, primarily peanuts.  These more than offset a 5 percent increase in segment marketing expense during the third quarter of 2011.  Segment profit margin for the quarter improved significantly from 24.2 percent in the third quarter of 2010, to 26.4 percent in 2011.

Market
Net sales and volume in the U.S. Retail Oils and Baking Market segment increased 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.

While net sales were flat,  baking volume declined 9 percent resulting from a combination of planned reductions in lower-margin products, and a continuing competitive and promotional environment.  Volume also declined in branded canned milk in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.

Special Markets segment profit decreased 8 percent and profit margin declined to 12.3 percent from 14.2 percent for the third quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.  Impairment charges of $17.2 million related to  intangible assets in Canada were recorded in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $7.3 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The incremental charge of $9.9 million reduced segment profit margin by 4.2 percentage points.

Other Financial Results and Measures
Cash provided by operations was $374.8 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $323.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting the completion of the Companys key promotional periods.  The significant cash generated in the third quarter of 2011 is consistent with the Companys expectations, whereby, cash provided by operations in the second half of the fiscal year typically exceeds the amount in the first half of the year, upon completion of the Companys key Fall Bake and Holiday promotional periods.

During the third quarter of 2011, the Company completed the repurchase of 3.7 million common shares available under previous Board of Directors authorizations utilizing $240.0 million of cash on hand.  In January 2011, the Board of Directors authorized up to an additional five million common shares, all of which remain available for repurchase.
For the third quarter of 2011, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $275.3 million, or 21.0 percent of net sales, compared to $257.4 million, or 21.3 percent of net sales, in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of 7 percent.  For the first nine months of 2011, EBITDA was $795.9 million, or 21.9 percent of net sales, compared to $745.8 million, or 21.1 percent of net sales, for the first nine months of 2010, also an increase of 7 percent.
Outlook
For fiscal 2011, net sales are expected to increase 4 percent compared to the prior year.  The increase from the Companys previous expectation reflects further price increases taken during the third quarter.  Non-GAAP income per diluted share is expected to range from $4.60 to $4.65.  This range includes the impact of third quarter impairment charges of $0.10 per diluted share, but excludes special project costs of $0.65 to $0.70 per diluted share.  Previously the range was $4.55 to $4.65, excluding special project costs of $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share.  The additional five million common shares authorized for repurchase have not been factored into this range.
