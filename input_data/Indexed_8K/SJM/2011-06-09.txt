Executive Summary
 
 
Page 1
 
Our long-term focus and strategy of owning and marketing leading brands have allowed us to deliver another year of strong sales and earnings, commented Tim Smucker, Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer.  We are gratified to have achieved these results in a challenging operating environment.  Our ongoing success provides opportunities to return value to our shareholders.  During the year, we repurchased over four percent of our outstanding common shares and increased the dividends paid by 17 percent.  Total shareholder return for 2011 exceeded 25 percent reflecting the impact of these actions.
As we begin the new fiscal year, we remain focused on building our brands while navigating through this period of commodity cost volatility, added Richard Smucker, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer.  We continue to demonstrate our ability to effectively manage these challenges while providing value to our consumers.  With a number of key initiatives and new products planned for 2012, along with contributions from the recently acquired Rowland Coffee Roasters brands, we are confident in providing full year earnings per share guidance that is consistent with our stated long-term growth objectives.
Net Sales
 
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased $118.1 million, or 11 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, as the net impact of price realization contributed approximately 8 percent of the overall increase.  Volume increased 2 percent as gains were realized in the majority of our brands including baking mixes and frostings, peanut butter,coffee,  oils,pickles,and fruit spreads.  The overall impact of sales mix and foreign exchange rates was favorable.

Margins
 
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
Gross profit decreased $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, as the increase in net sales was offset by overall higher raw material and freight costs and an additional $11.8 million of special project costs included in cost of products sold.  Excluding special project costs, gross profit increased $2.7 million, or 1 percent.  Costs were significantly higher for green coffee and soybean oil.  As expected, price increases taken throughout the year to offset higher commodity costs were realized and contributed to incremental gross profit, but did not generate margin expansion.  Gross margin declined from 40.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, to 36.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding special project costs.  Gross margin was also impacted by price declines in effect on  oils during the first half of the quarter, despite higher costs.
Crisco
Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased 3 percent, compared to 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net sales from 21.5 percent to 18.8 percent.  Marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased 14 percent, compared to the same period in 2010 that included significant levels of advertising investments.  Selling, distribution, and general and administrative expenses all increased between 2 percent and 4 percent, significantly less than the percentage increase in net sales.
Operating income decreased $14.9 million, or 8 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, including the overall increase in special project costs of approximately $21.6 million driven by the Companys on-going progress on its restructuring project.  Excluding the impact of special project costs in both periods, operating income increased $6.7 million, or 4 percent, and declined from 17.9 percent of net sales in 2010, to 16.7 percent in 2011.

Interest and Income Taxes
Interest expense increased $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to higher average debt outstanding.
Income taxes increased $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.  The effective tax rate was 36.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 27.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The effective tax rate for the year increased to 33.1 percent for 2011, compared to 32.4 percent for 2010.   The increase in the effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and full year ended 2011, compared to 2010, is primarily due to higher current and deferred state income taxes and reduced tax benefits associated with the Canadian operations, partially offset by increased tax benefits related to the domestic manufacturing deduction in 2011, compared to 2010.

Segment Performance
 
While the Companys four reportable segments remain the same for 2011, the calculation of segment profit was modified at the beginning of 2011 to include intangible asset amortization and impairment charges related to segment assets, along with certain other items in each of the segments.  These items were previously considered corporate expenses and were not allocated to the segments.  This change more accurately aligns the segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, most notably in the area of intangible assets.  Fiscal 2010 segment profit has been recalculated to be consistent with the current methodology.
U.S. Retail Coffee Market
The U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment net sales increased 21 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of three price increases taken during 2011 totaling 23 percent, partially offset by increased spending in support of the Easter promotional period.   Volume increased 3 percent for the  brand in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and offset a low double-digit percent decline in  packaged coffee which realized a strong fourth quarter last year with volume up double digits.  Overall segment volume was flat in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.  The introduction of  and offerings earlier in the fiscal year contributed approximately 5 percent of the U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011.

U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment profit increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.  Green coffee costs were significantly higher in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, but were offset by the net realization of previously announced price increases.  Marketing expenses decreased $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, as advertising was at more typical levels in the current year, and record incremental investments were made in the prior year.  Segment profit margin was 23.2 percent in 2011, compared to 25.9 percent in 2010.  In May 2011, an 11 percent price increase was implemented on the majority of coffee products to offset further increases in green coffee costs.
U.S. Retail Consumer Market
The U.S. Retail Consumer Market segment net sales were flat and volume increased 2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, excluding the effect of potato products divested in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Net sales include the impact of a peanut butter price reduction of 5 percent taken earlier in the fiscal year.  Volume gains in peanut butter and fruit spreads were offset somewhat by declines in sandwiches.  Reported segment net sales decreased 2 percent and volume increased 1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, including the divested potato products.

The U.S. Retail Consumer Market segment profit decreased 7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter in 2010 which benefited from a $12.9 million gain on the divestiture of potato products.  Segment marketing expense and supply chain costs decreased in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.  Segment profit margin was 28.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 30.5 percent in 2010 that included a 4.8 percentage point impact of the gain on divestiture.
U.S. Retail Oils and Baking Market
Net sales and volume in the U.S. Retail Oils and Baking Market segment increased 11 percent and 6 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.  Volume was up 15 percent for the  brand with gains in baking mixes and frostings, and up 6 percent for the  brand driven by oils.   Milk volume also increased modestly.  Price increases were taken in the third quarter of 2011 on frosting and flours, and in the fourth quarter of 2011 on oils and shortening but were not fully realized due to higher promotional spending for the Easter holiday.  The impact of mix on net sales was favorable.

Although net price realization for the quarter did not offset higher costs, segment profit increased 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.   A portion of planned marketing expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2011 was redirected to promotional spending, resulting in a decrease in marketing expenses, compared to 2010.  The prior year fourth quarter was negatively impacted by intangible asset impairments and losses on the disposition of assets no longer used in manufacturing operations.  Segment profit margin decreased from 12.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, to 12.0 percent in 2011.
Special Markets
Net sales in the Special Markets segment increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.  Excluding foreign exchange, segment net sales increased 5 percent over the same time period primarily due to price increases and mix.  Solid volume gains were realized in coffee and pickles.  Overall segment volume decreased 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010, driven by declines in flour, nonbranded natural foods beverages, and frozen fruit and vegetables.

Special Markets segment profit increased 11 percent, as the impact of price increases, sales mix, and supply chain improvements related to sandwich production more than offset higher raw material costs, and an increase in marketing and distribution expenses, primarily in Canada.  Segment profit for the fourth quarter of 2010 included losses on the disposition of assets no longer used in manufacturing operations.  Segment profit margin improved to 17.9 percent from 17.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 2010.

Other Financial Results and Measures
Cash provided by operations was $391.6 million for the year ended April 30, 2011, reflecting cash used for operations of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter.  The Company typically experiences significant cash generation in the second half of its fiscal year upon completion of the Companys key Fall Bake and Holiday promotional periods.  However, the impact of commodity cost increases on higher inventory levels, and increased trade receivable balances due to the timing of the Easter holiday later in April, caused a significant increase in working capital requirements during the fourth quarter of 2011.

During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company completed the repurchase of approximately 2.0 million common shares utilizing $141.8 million of cash on hand, bringing total shares repurchased under Board of Directors authorizations for the year to approximately 5.7 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $228.0 million, or 19.2 percent of net sales, compared to $233.1 million, or 21.8 percent of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of 2 percent.  For 2011, EBITDA was $1,023.9 million, or 21.2 percent of net sales, compared to $978.9 million, or 21.3 percent of net sales, for 2010, an increase of 5 percent.
Outlook
The Company remains committed to its strategy of owning and marketing North American food brands which hold the number one market position in their respective categories.  In 2012, the Company expects cost of products sold to increase approximately 25 percent driven primarily by significantly higher commodity costs, compared to 2011.  Price increases have been taken in response to these higher costs.  The full year impact of price increases taken during 2011 and early 2012, along with the recently announced acquisition of the coffee brands and business operations of Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc. are expected to result in a 2012 net sales increase of approximately 20 percent, compared to the prior year.  Non-GAAP income per diluted share is expected to range from $5.00 to $5.15 and assumes approximately 114.0 million shares outstanding.  This range excludes special project costs of $0.55 to $0.60 per diluted share.

Non-GAAP Measures
The Company uses non-GAAP measures including net sales, excluding divestitures and foreign exchange rate impact; gross profit, operating income, income, and income per diluted share, excluding special project costs; EBITDA; and free cash flow as key measures for purposes of evaluating performance internally.  These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Rather, the presentation of these non-GAAP measures supplements other metrics used by management to internally evaluate its businesses, and facilitates the comparison of past and present operations.  These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP items for the current and prior year quarter and year-to-date period is included in the Unaudited Non-GAAP Measures table.
