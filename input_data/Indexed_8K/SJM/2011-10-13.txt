Effective May 1, 2011, The J. M. Smucker Company's (the "Company") reportable segments were modified to align segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, consistent with the executive appointments announced in a press release dated March 8, 2011. As a result, the Company now presents the following three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. The new U.S. Retail Consumer Foods reportable segment is a combination of the former U.S. Retail Consumer and U.S. Retail Oils and Baking reportable segments, and the Special Markets segment has been renamed International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. Also effective May 1, 2011, certain specialty brands which were previously included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment are included in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP Akron, Ohio
October 13, 2011

Exhibit 99.1
PART I
Item 1. Business.
          . The J. M. Smucker Company (the "Company") was established in 1897 and was incorporated in Ohio in 1921. The Company, often referred to as (a registered trademark), operates principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of the Company's sales are in the U.S. The Company's operations outside the U.S. are principally in Canada although products are exported to other countries as well. Sales outside the U.S. represented approximately 10 percent of consolidated Company sales for fiscal 2011. The Company's branded food products include a strong portfolio of trusted, iconic, market-leading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in North America.
The Company
Smucker's
          On November 6, 2008, the Company completed a merger transaction with The Folgers Coffee Company ("Folgers"), a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company ("P&G"). The value of the transaction was approximately $3.7 billion, including the issuance of common shares of the Company in connection with the merger and $350 million of Folgers debt. Under the terms of the transaction agreements, P&G distributed common shares of Folgers to participating P&G shareholders which were then automatically converted into the right to receive common shares of the Company in the merger. Immediately following the merger, P&G shareholders and pre-merger Company shareholders owned approximately 53.5 percent and 46.5 percent, respectively, of the Company's approximately 118 million common shares outstanding. The merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination, with the Company treated as the acquiring entity.
          The Company has three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. The Company's two U.S. retail market segments in total comprised over 80 percent of the Company's net sales in 2011 and represent a major portion of the strategic focus area for the Company  the sale of branded food products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in North America. The International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment represents sales outside of the U.S. retail market.
          . The principal products of the Company, which are sold across the Company's U.S. retail market segments and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods
Principal Products
 
segment are coffee, peanut butter, fruit spreads, shortening and oils, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings, canned milk, flour and baking ingredients, juices and beverages, frozen sandwiches, toppings, syrups, and pickles and condiments.
          Product sales information for the years 2011, 2010, and 2009 is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in Exhibit 99.3, Revised and Updated Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of the 2011 Form 10-K , under "Note E: Reportable Segments."
          In both of the U.S. retail market segments, the Company's products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and through brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, and military commissaries. In the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment, the Company's products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, schools and universities, and health care operators), health and natural foods stores and distributors.
          . The raw materials used by the Company in each of its segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Green coffee, peanuts, edible oils, sweeteners, milk, flour, corn, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The availability, quality, and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. The Company uses basis contracts and commodity futures and options to manage price volatility for a significant portion of its commodity costs. Green coffee is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price are subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, pest damage, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. Fruit and vegetable raw materials used by the Company in the production of its food products are purchased from independent growers and suppliers. Glass, plastic, steel cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate are the principal packaging materials used by the Company.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
          Raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although the Company has elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary year-to-year, the Company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to single-sourced materials are available. The Company has not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials. The Company considers its relationship with key raw material suppliers to be good.
          . The Company's products are produced under certain patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Major trademarks, utilized primarily in the U.S. retail market segments, include: , and in the U.S. Retail Coffee segment;

          . The Company's U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segments are particularly seasonal around the "Fall Bake" and holiday period, which generally results in higher sales and profits in the Company's second and third quarters. The Company's success in promoting and merchandising its baking and coffee brands during the "Fall Bake" and holiday period has a significant impact on its results for a fiscal year. The back-to-school period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods for the Company, although their impact to the Company is not as significant as the "Fall Bake" and holiday period.
Seasonality
          . Working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of the Company's fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee, oil, and baking inventories necessary to support the "Fall Bake" and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season.
Working Capital
          . Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately 26 percent, 27 percent, 24 percent of net sales in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segments. No other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2011, 2010, and 2009.
Customers
          During 2011, the Company's top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 55 percent of consolidated net sales. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact the Company's sales and profits, the Company does not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for the Company's products.
          . Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.
Orders
          . No material portion of the Company's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.
Government Business
          . The Company is the branded market leader in the coffee, peanut butter, shortening, sweetened condensed milk, fruit spreads, ice cream toppings, and natural foods beverages categories in the U.S. The Company's business is highly competitive as all of its U.S. retail market segments' brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products.
Competition
          The continued growth of alternative store formats, product and packaging innovations, technological advances, and new industry techniques are all issues for companies in the food industry to consider in order to remain competitive. The primary ways in which products are
 
distinguished are product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, advertising, and promotion. Positive factors pertaining to the Company's competitive position include well-recognized brands, superior product quality and trust, experienced brand management, a single national grocery broker in the U.S., varied product offerings, product innovation, excellent customer service, and a strong distribution network.
          The Company historically has seen accelerated private label growth during periods of general economic disruption. The Company estimates that, during the period following the economic recession of the late 2000's, private label grew more than during past periods partly due to the run up in commodity costs, increased emphasis of store brands by retailers, and improvements in private label quality. The Company believes that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food categories in which it competes, appealing to different consumer segments. The Company closely monitors the price gap or price premium between its brands and private label brands, with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers' shopping baskets.
          In the U.S. Retail Coffee segment, the brand competes in the highly competitive U.S. packaged roast and ground coffee market with other retail coffee roasters such as Maxwell House, Yuban, and Nescafe. The Company competes in the premium coffee market with its and brands, as well as through sales of retail packaged coffee products, with other brands such as , , and . In 2010, the Company expanded its presence in the single-serve coffee market, entering into an agreement with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. and Keurig, Inc. for the manufacturing and distribution of premium coffees through Keurig's innovative coffee system. The Company's and premium coffees products were introduced in the second quarter of 2011 and represent the most successful new product launch in the Company's history.

also significantly impacted by volatile commodity pricing. The Company's brand competes in the dessert and baking mixes ("DBM") market that includes mixes for cakes, cookies, brownies, muffins, and quick breads, as well as ready-to-spread frostings and ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour. Within the DBM category, the Company competes primarily with the and brands and many private label and regional brands.

The Company is the branded market leader in the sweetened condensed category with its and brands and has significant sales with production of private label brands. In the evaporated milk category, the Company has a significant presence with its production of private label brands and the brand where it competes primarily with one major national brand.

Research and Development
          . The Company considers environmental sustainability to be its responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area for the Company. The Company has implemented and manages a variety of programs, including the utilization of renewable energy technology, improved wastewater management, increased usage of sustainable raw materials, and reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones, in support of its commitment to environmental sustainability. The Company continues to evaluate and modify its processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce its impact on the environment and reduce waste.
Environmental Matters
          Compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal, state, and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in 2012.
          . At April 30, 2011, the Company had approximately 4,500 full-time employees, worldwide.

The Company has three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. The Company's two U.S. retail market segments in total comprised over 80 percent of the Company's net sales in 2011 and represent a major portion of the strategic focus area for the Company  the sale of branded food products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in North America. The International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment represents sales outside of the U.S. retail market segments.
 
In both of the U.S. retail market segments, the Company's products are sold primarily to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, and military commissaries. In the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment, the Company's products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, schools and universities, health care operators), and health and natural foods stores and distributors.
Strategic Elements
The Company remains rooted in its Basic Beliefs of and , established by its founder and namesake, Jerome Smucker, more than a century ago. Today, these basic beliefs are the core of the Company's unique culture and serve as a foundation for decision making and actions. The Company has been led by four generations of family leadership, having had only five chief executive officers in 114 years. This continuity of management and thought extends to the broader leadership team that embodies the values and embraces the business practices that have contributed to the Company's consistent growth.
Quality, People, Ethics, Growth,
Independence
The Company's strategic vision is to own and market food brands which hold the number one market position in their category, with an emphasis on North America while embracing a global perspective.
The Company's strategic long-term growth objectives are to increase net sales by six percent and earnings per share by greater than eight percent annually. While the net sales contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year, the Company expects organic growth, including new products, to add three to four percent per year and acquisitions to contribute the remainder over the long term.
 
Results of Operations
On November 6, 2008, the Company completed a merger transaction with The Folgers Coffee Company ("Folgers"), previously a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination and Folgers is included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger. Because the transaction closed during the first week of the Company's 2009 third quarter, incremental Folgers business, approximating six months of operations, is included in 2010, compared to 2009 ("incremental Folgers business").
 
Summary of 2011
Net sales in 2011 increased five percent, compared to 2010, primarily due to price increases. Sales mix and foreign exchange rates also contributed to more than offset the impact of potato products divested in March 2010 and a one percent decline in volume. While the net effect of price increases more than offset overall higher raw material costs, increased restructuring and merger and integration costs ("special project costs") and impairment charges resulted in a one percent decline in operating income. Excluding special project costs, operating income increased eight percent for 2011, compared to 2010. The Company's net income per diluted
 
share decreased two percent, yet increased seven percent excluding special project costs, for 2011, compared to 2010.
Summary of 2010
Net sales, margins, and earnings per share growth was realized in 2010 as the incremental Folgers business and improved profitability across all of the Company's reportable segments contributed to the improvements. Company net sales increased 23 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, as incremental Folgers business more than offset the impact of price reductions in certain categories resulting from generally lower commodity costs in 2010, compared to 2009. Operating income increased 75 percent and, excluding special project costs, increased 55 percent as the Company realized the first full year of synergies associated with the Folgers merger and the benefit of favorable green coffee costs. Net income per common share  assuming dilution increased approximately 33 percent. Excluding special project costs, income per common share  assuming dilution increased approximately 16 percent in 2010, compared to 2009.
Net Sales
2011 Compared to 2010
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
Net sales for 2011 increased $220.5 million, or five percent, compared to 2010, as the net impact of pricing contributed approximately four percent to net sales and the overall impact of sales mix was favorable. The impact of the potato products divestiture and foreign exchange was not significant. Overall volume decreased one percent. Volume gains were realized in peanut butter, oils, natural foods beverages, fruit spreads,

Amounts may not add due to rounding.
Net sales increased $847.4 million, or 23 percent, to $4,605.3 million in 2010, compared to $3,757.9 million in 2009. Acquisitions, primarily incremental Folgers business, contributed $920.9 million to 2010 net sales. Excluding acquisitions, the potato business divested in March 2010, and the impact of foreign exchange, net sales were down two percent in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to pricing.
Excluding the incremental Folgers business and divestiture, volume increased one percent in 2010, compared to 2009, with gains across most of the Company's leading brands including flour, baking mixes, and frostings, peanut butter, shortening and oils, baking products in Canada, pancakes and syrups, and fruit spreads. Volume declines were primarily in private label canned milk, regional baking brands, and frozen fruit in Canada. The overall favorable impact of volume growth on net sales was more than offset by a three percent price and mix decline, attributable primarily to price reductions in the U.S. Consumer Foods segment, and an increase in promotional spending across several categories.

Gross profit increased $11.8 million in 2011, compared to 2010, as the increase in net sales offset the impact of overall higher raw material and freight costs and $50.2 million of incremental special project costs included in cost of products sold, consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation. Excluding special project costs, gross profit increased $62.0 million, or three percent, yet decreased as a percent of net sales from 38.9 percent in 2010 to 38.4 percent in 2011. Raw material cost increases were most significant for green coffee, soybean oil, milk, and sugar and more than offset lower costs for peanuts. Price increases taken during the year, mostly on the Company's coffee brands to offset higher green coffee costs, drove the gross profit increase in 2011, but did not generate gross margin expansion compared to 2010. Gross margin was also reduced by price declines in effect on oils during part of 2011 in response to competitive dynamics, despite higher soybean oil costs. Unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity derivatives in 2011 were not material.
Crisco
Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses ("SD&A") decreased two percent in 2011, compared to 2010, and decreased as a percentage of net sales from 19.1 percent to 17.9
 
percent. Marketing expenses, including advertising, decreased eight percent in 2011, compared to 2010, which included record investment in print, online, and television advertisement in support of the Company's largest brands. Distribution expenses decreased one percent in 2011, compared to 2010, related generally to declines in sales volume. Selling expenses increased three percent but remained flat as a percentage of net sales. General and administrative expenses increased two percent, primarily related to higher depreciation charges and digital marketing initiatives, but were lower as a percentage of net sales.
Noncash impairment charges of $17.6 million and $11.7 million were recognized in 2011 and 2010, respectively, resulting from the write-down to estimated fair value of certain of the Company's intangible assets, primarily the trademark and customer relationship. Other operating expense  net of $0.6 million was recognized in 2011 consisting of losses on the disposition of assets. Other operating income  net of $3.3 million was recognized in 2010 resulting from a $12.9 million gain recognized on the divestiture of the potato business which more than offset losses on the disposition of assets.
Europe's Best
Operating income decreased $6.6 million, or one percent, in 2011, compared to 2010, including an overall $73.7 million increase in special project costs. Excluding the impact of special project costs in both periods, operating income increased $67.1 million, or eight percent, and improved from 18.0 percent of net sales in 2010 to 18.6 percent in 2011. Special project costs were higher in 2011, compared to 2010, driven by the Company's ongoing progress on its restructuring project which were only slightly offset by lower integration costs as activities related to Folgers were minimal.
2010 Compared to 2009
Gross profit increased $535.3 million, or 43 percent, in 2010, compared to 2009, and improved to 38.8 percent of net sales from 33.3 percent over the same period. Much of the gross profit improvement was attributable to incremental Folgers business and other coffee-related impacts in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily favorable green coffee costs and volume-related plant efficiencies. Lower other raw material costs, notably oils, flour, and milk, and freight costs across the businesses also favorably impacted gross margin in 2010, compared to 2009. Unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity derivatives in 2010 were not material.
 
SD&A expenses increased 30 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to incremental Folgers business and the larger company. Marketing expense, including advertising expense, increased approximately 39 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, as the Company made a record investment in advertisement. Advertising expense was $130.6 million in 2010, compared to $77.4 million in 2009. Selling and distribution expenses both increased 17 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, as the impact of synergies related to the Folgers merger partially offset the expense impact of the incremental Folgers business. General and administrative expenses increased 38 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, as 2009 did not include expenses to fully support the Folgers business. Increased pension and other employee benefit costs and costs related to the closure of the Company's West Fargo, North Dakota, manufacturing facility, are also included in 2010.
Amortization expense was $73.7 million in 2010, an increase of $34.8 million from 2009, reflecting the full year impact of intangible assets associated with the Folgers transaction. Noncash impairment charges of $11.7 million were recognized in 2010, primarily related to the trademark in Canada.
Europe's Best
Other operating income  net of $3.3 million was recognized in 2010 resulting from a $12.9 million gain recognized on the divestiture of the potato business which offset other asset losses. Other operating expense  net of $2.4 million was recognized in 2009 consisting of losses on the disposition of assets.
Driven by gross profit improvements, operating income increased 75 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, and improved from 12.0 percent to 17.2 percent of net sales. Special project costs were $43.5 million lower in 2010, compared to 2009, as integration activities related to Folgers were near completion and restructuring costs had minimal impact.
Interest Income and Expense
Interest income was flat in 2011, compared to 2010. Interest expense increased $4.4 million during 2011, compared to 2010, due to higher average debt outstanding. The interest expense impact of $625.0 million of debt repayments in 2010, most of which were made in the second half of the year, was more than offset by the interest expense associated with the issuance of $400.0 million in 4.50 percent Senior Notes on June 15, 2010.
 
Interest income decreased $4.2 million during 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in the average investment balance throughout the year. Interest expense increased $2.7 million in 2010, compared to 2009, reflecting an increase in the Company's debt obligations during the first half of 2010, compared to the first half of 2009, resulting from the October 2008 issuance of $400.0 million in Senior Notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.60 percent and the addition of Folgers' $350.0 million variable-rate bank note payable at the merger date. The interest incurred on these additional borrowings was mostly offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the scheduled repayments of Senior Notes of $75.0 million and $200.0 million in June and November 2009, respectively, and the Folgers' $350.0 million bank note in November 2009.
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased slightly in 2011, compared to 2010, despite a two percent decrease in income before income taxes during the same period. The effective tax rate increased to 33.1 percent in 2011, from 32.4 percent in 2010, primarily due to higher current and deferred state income taxes and reduced tax benefits associated with the Canadian operations, partially offset by increased tax benefits related to the domestic manufacturing deduction in 2011, compared to 2010.
Income taxes increased $106.5 million, or 82 percent, during 2010, compared to 2009, slightly less than the percentage increase in income before income taxes as the effective tax rate was 32.4 percent in 2010, compared to 32.9 percent in 2009. The effective tax rate decrease was primarily a result of lower deferred tax rates and increased benefits realized from the domestic manufacturing deduction, offset somewhat by increases in state and local income taxes.
Restructuring
In calendar 2010, the Company announced its plan to restructure its coffee, fruit spreads, and Canadian pickle and condiments operations as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance the long-term strength and profitability of its leading brands. The initiative is a long-term investment to optimize production capacity and lower the overall cost structure. It includes estimated capital investments of approximately $220.0 million, to be incurred through 2014, for a new state-of-the-art food manufacturing facility in Orrville, Ohio, and consolidation of coffee production in
 
New Orleans, Louisiana. The Company's pickle and condiments production will be transitioned to third-party manufacturers.
Upon completion in 2014, the restructuring plan will result in the closing of six of the Company's facilities  Memphis, Tennessee; Ste. Marie, Quebec; Sherman, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Dunnville, Ontario; and Delhi Township, Ontario; and the reduction of approximately 850 full-time positions. The Sherman facility closed in April 2011.
The Company expects total restructuring costs of approximately $235.0 million, of which $107.7 million has been incurred through April 30, 2011, including $102.0 million in 2011 consisting primarily of $53.6 million of long-lived asset charges and $36.0 million of employee separation costs. The restructuring is proceeding as planned and the balance of the costs is anticipated to be recognized over the next three fiscal years as the facilities are closed.
Subsequent Event
On May 16, 2011, the Company announced that it had completed an acquisition of the coffee brands and business operations of Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc. ("Rowland Coffee"), a privately-held company headquartered in Miami, Florida, for $360.0 million in cash.
Rowland Coffee's products are primarily sold under the leading Hispanic and brands with distribution in retail and foodservice channels concentrated in southern Florida and the northeastern U.S. It is a leading producer of espresso coffee in the U.S., generating total net sales in excess of $110.0 million in calendar 2010. The acquisition includes a manufacturing, distribution, and office facility in Miami. The Company completed the transaction with cash on hand and borrowings of $180.0 million under its existing credit facility.

Segment Results
The Company's reportable segments have been modified to align segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, consistent with the executive appointments announced in March 2011. As a result, the Company now presents the following three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. The U.S. Retail Coffee segment represents the domestic sales of and branded coffee to retail customers; the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of
Folgers, Dunkin' Donuts,
Millstone
Smucker's, Crisco, Jif,
 
branded products; and the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment is comprised of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, schools and universities, health care operators), and health and natural foods stores and distributors.
Pillsbury, Eagle Brand, Hungry Jack, and Martha White
In addition, certain specialty brands which were previously included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment are included in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment ("product realignments"). Segment performance for 2011, 2010, and 2009 has been reclassified for these product realignments and the organizational changes described above.
The calculation of segment profit was modified at the beginning of 2011 to include intangible asset amortization and impairment charges related to segment assets, along with certain other items in each of the segments. These items were previously considered corporate expenses and were not allocated to the segments. This change more accurately aligns the segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, most notably in the area of intangible assets. Segment profit for 2010 and 2009 has been presented to be consistent with the current methodology.
 
U.S. Retail Coffee
Net sales for the U.S. Retail Coffee segment increased 14 percent in 2011, compared to 2010. Price increases taken during the year contributed approximately 11 percent to net sales and more than offset a one percent volume decline. The introduction of and offerings in the second quarter of the fiscal year added approximately three percent to U.S. Retail Coffee segment net sales in 2011. Volume decreased two percent for the brand while packaged coffee increased six percent in 2011, compared to 2010. Segment profit increased 11 percent in 2011, compared to 2010, as price increases realized during the year more than offset higher green coffee costs. Segment marketing expenses decreased 17 percent in 2011, compared to 2010, as advertising was at more typical levels in the current year and incremental investments were made in the prior year. Segment profit margin declined to 27.8 percent in 2011, from 28.5 percent in 2010.

U.S. Retail Coffee segment net sales nearly doubled in 2010, compared to 2009, including incremental Folgers business totaling approximately $840.6 million. Volume increased approximately four percent in 2010, compared to the same full 12-month period in 2009, which included the period prior to the merger, approximating six months of operations. The brand contributed the majority of the volume increase in 2010, compared to 2009. Continued growth of coffee also contributed double-digit volume growth and nearly $250.0 million in net sales for 2010. The U.S. Retail Coffee segment profit more than doubled to $484.0 million in 2010, compared to $211.1 million in 2009, and improved to 28.5 percent of net sales, from 24.7 percent in 2009. The 2010 segment profit margin was favorably impacted by green coffee costs, product mix, and volume-related plant efficiencies which offset significantly increased marketing investments.

Dunkin' Donuts
U.S. Retail Consumer Foods
Net sales and volume for the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment decreased three percent in 2011, compared to 2010. Net sales and volume decreased one percent for the same period excluding potato products. Net sales include the impact of a peanut butter price reduction of five percent taken at the beginning of the fiscal year as well as oil price declines in effect during much of the year. Volume gains were realized in peanut butter, oils, fruit spreads, and pancake mixes and syrups, offset by declines in flour and baking mixes. The declines in flour and baking mixes were the result of planned reductions in lower-margin products and a competitive and promotional environment during

most of the year. Regional baking brands and canned milk were also down. While segment profit in 2011 was flat compared to 2010, segment profit margin improved from 20.3 percent to 20.8 percent, as decreases in supply chain costs and marketing expenses in 2011 more than offset the gain of approximately $12.9 million on divested potato products included in 2010.
Total volume in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment increased two percent in 2010, compared to 2009, with gains in flour and baking mixes, peanut butter, oils, pancake mixes and syrups, and fruit spreads, which were offset by declines in canned milk and regional baking brands. U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment net sales decreased three percent in 2010, compared to 2009, reflecting the full year impact of price declines taken during 2009 on certain items and increased promotional spending. During March 2010, the Company divested its potato products in a $19.0 million cash transaction realizing a gain of approximately $12.9 million on the divestiture. U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment profit increased 13 percent for 2010, compared to 2009, mainly due to the divestiture gain and lower raw material costs, offset by a five percent increase in marketing expense as well as intangible asset impairments and losses on the disposition of assets no longer used in manufacturing operations. Segment profit margin improved from 17.4 percent in 2009 to 20.3 percent in 2010.

Net sales and volume in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment increased five percent and two percent, respectively, in 2011, compared to 2010. Excluding foreign exchange, net sales increased two percent compared to the same period last year. International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment profit increased 14 percent and improved to 16.9 percent of net sales in 2011, from 15.6 percent of net sales in 2010. Impairment charges of $17.2 million related to intangible assets in Canada were recorded in 2011, compared to $7.3 million in 2010. The incremental impairment charge of $9.9 million reduced segment profit margin by 1.1 percentage points. However, segment profit in 2011 benefited from lower supply chain costs and favorable sales mix, primarily driven by coffee, which more than offset the impact of the higher impairment charge.

Folgers
 
Net sales in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment increased eight percent in 2010, compared to 2009, due to a favorable exchange rate impact of $23.4 million and incremental Folgers business totaling approximately $78.3 million. Net sales, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, decreased four percent over the same period. Volume decreased one percent, excluding incremental Folgers business, in 2010, compared to 2009. Gains in Canada's baking and spreads categories and coffee in the foodservice and export businesses were offset by declines in frozen fruit in Canada, natural foods beverages, and foodservice portion control. The impact of the overall volume decline, combined with lower prices and increases in promotional spending, resulted in the net sales decline, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange. International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment profit increased 27 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, primarily due to the impact of increased coffee sales and lower raw material costs which more than offset the impairment charge related to and losses on the disposition of assets no longer used in manufacturing operations. Segment profit margin improved from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 15.6 percent in 2010.

Financial Condition
Liquidity
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
The Company's principal source of funds is cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings against the Company's revolving credit facility. Total cash and cash equivalents increased to $319.8 million at April 30, 2011, compared to $283.6 million at April 30, 2010.
The Company expects a significant use of cash during the first half of each fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal fruit and vegetable procurement, the buildup of inventories to support the Fall Bake and Holiday period, and the additional increase of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season. The Company typically expects cash provided by operations in the second half of the year to significantly exceed the amount in the first half of the year, upon completion of the Company's key promotional periods.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was $391.6 million, compared to $713.5 million in 2010. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011, compared to 2010, was primarily related to increases in commodity costs on higher inventory levels, an increase in income tax payments, and the timing of the Easter holiday. The significant increase in commodity costs, primarily green coffee in the second half of 2011, is reflected in higher trade receivables and inventory balances, offset somewhat by the related impact of an increase in accounts payable in 2011, compared to 2010. Also contributing to the higher trade receivables is the Easter holiday occurring later in 2011 than in 2010 resulting in more of the collection cycle being deferred into the next fiscal year. Approximately $80.0 million of the increase in income tax payments represents a change in the timing of the payments.
 
Cash used for investing activities was $192.9 million in 2011, compared to $104.4 million in 2010. The increased cash used for investing activities in 2011, compared to 2010, was primarily due to the purchase of $75.6 million of marketable securities in 2011 and increased capital expenditures. Cash used for capital expenditures increased to $180.1 million in 2011, compared to $137.0 million in 2010, primarily related to expenditures associated with the Company's restructuring project and corporate headquarters expansion.
Cash used for financing activities during 2011 was $170.4 million. The Company's issuance of $400.0 million in Senior Notes was more than offset by quarterly dividend payments of $194.0 million and the purchase of treasury shares for $389.1 million, including the repurchase of approximately 5.7 million common shares available under Board of Directors' authorizations. During 2010, total cash of $788.5 million was used for financing purposes consisting primarily of $625.0 million in debt repayments and $166.2 million in quarterly dividend payments. The increased dividend payments in 2011, compared to 2010, resulted from increases in the quarterly dividend rate during the period.
Capital Resources
The following table presents the Company's capital structure.
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
On June 15, 2010, the Company issued $400.0 million of 4.50 percent Senior Notes with a final maturity on June 1, 2025. The Senior Notes have a 12-year average maturity with scheduled payments starting on June 1, 2020. Proceeds from the Senior Notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of treasury shares. On September 1, 2010, the Company repaid the $10.0 million of 7.94 percent Series C Senior Notes utilizing cash on hand.
 
On January 31, 2011, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of six banks. The credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving credit line of $600.0 million and matures January 31, 2016. At April 30, 2011, the Company did not have a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year end, the Company borrowed $240.0 million under its revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including the Rowland Coffee acquisition.
During 2011, the Company completed the repurchase of approximately 5.7 million common shares under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans utilizing $381.5 million of cash on hand. At April 30, 2011, approximately 3.0 million common shares remain available for repurchase under the Board of Directors' most recent authorization, including approximately 0.5 million common shares remaining under the Company's Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan ("Plan") established in March 2011. Purchases will be transacted by a broker based upon the guidelines and parameters of the Plan. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased.
Cash requirements for 2012 will include capital expenditures of approximately $250.0 to $275.0 million, including amounts related to the announced restructuring program, quarterly dividend payments of approximately $200.0 million based on current rates and common shares outstanding, and interest payments on long-term debt obligations of approximately $65.0 million for the year. Absent any further acquisitions or other significant investments, the Company believes that cash on hand, combined with cash provided by operations and borrowings available under its credit facility, will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures, the payment of quarterly dividends, and interest on debt outstanding.
Non-GAAP Measures
The Company uses non-GAAP measures including net sales excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange rate impact; gross profit, operating income, income, and income per diluted share, excluding special project costs; and free cash flow as key measures
 
for purposes of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Rather, the presentation of these non-GAAP measures supplements other metrics used by management to internally evaluate its businesses and facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments. The following table reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measure.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as variable interest entities. Transactions with related parties are in the ordinary course of business, conducted at an arm's length basis, and not material to the Company's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at April 30, 2011. `
Purchase obligations in the above table include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in this category are certain obligations related to normal, ongoing purchase obligations in which the Company has guaranteed payment to ensure availability of raw materials and packaging supplies. The Company expects to receive consideration for these purchase obligations in the form of materials. The purchase obligations in the above table do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and tax-related net interest and penalties of approximately $22.1 million under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, , since the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The Company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria have been met: a valid customer order with a determinable price has been received; the product has been shipped and title has transferred to the customer; there is no further significant obligation to assist in the resale of the product; and collectibility is reasonably assured. A provision for estimated returns and allowances is recognized as a reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized.
Revenue Recognition.
In order to support the Company's products, various promotional activities are conducted through retail trade, distributors, or directly with consumers, including in-store display and product placement programs, feature price discounts, coupons, and other similar activities. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when it deems necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by retail trade, distributors, or consumers. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual performance are recognized as a change in management's estimate in a subsequent period. As the Company's total promotional expenditures, including amounts classified as a reduction of net sales, represented approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2011, the possibility exists of materially different reported results if factors such as the level and success of the promotional programs or other conditions differ from expectations.
Trade Marketing and Merchandising Programs.
 
The future tax benefit arising from the net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is approximately $116.9 million and $96.7 million at April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Management believes that the Company's earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results of the Company indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance has been provided.
Income Taxes.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable income, considering the viability of ongoing tax planning strategies and the probable recognition of future tax deductions and loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and projected future taxable income levels. Changes in estimated realization of deferred tax assets would result in an adjustment to income in the period in which that determination is made.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to uncertainties related to tax filing positions and periodically assesses these tax positions for all tax years that remain subject to examination, based upon the latest information available. For uncertain tax positions, the Company has recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including any applicable interest and penalty charges, in accordance with FASB ASC 740.
Long-lived assets, except goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. However, determining fair value is subject to estimates of both cash flows and discount rates and different estimates could yield different results. There are no events or changes in circumstances of which management is aware that indicate the carrying value of the Company's long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
Long-Lived Assets.
 
The Company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually and more often if indicators of impairment exist. To test for goodwill impairment, the Company estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a market-based approach. The impairment test incorporates the Company's estimates of future cash flows, allocations of certain assets, liabilities, and cash flows among reporting units, future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The estimates and projections used in the calculation of fair value are consistent with the Company's current and long-range plans, including anticipated changes in market conditions, industry trends, growth rates, and planned capital expenditures. Changes in forecasted operations and other estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.
At April 30, 2011, goodwill totaled $2.8 billion. Goodwill is substantially concentrated within the U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segments. No goodwill impairment was recognized as a result of the annual evaluation performed as of February 1, 2011. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual test date, with the exception of the former U.S. Retail Oils and Baking reporting unit. A sensitivity analysis was performed for this reporting unit, which decreased the expected long-term growth rate by 50 basis points, and still yielded an estimated fair value which supported its carrying value.
The Company's other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting entirely of trademarks, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. To test these assets for impairment, the Company estimates the fair value of each asset based on a discounted cash flow model using various inputs, including projected revenues, an assumed royalty rate, and a discount rate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future.
At April 30, 2011, other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $1.8 billion. The Company has eight trademarks which represent several of its leading, iconic brands and comprise more than 95 percent of the total carrying value of its other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Each of these trademarks had an estimated fair value substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual test date.
 
To determine the Company's ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, management must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works. Various actuarial assumptions must be made in order to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date, the most significant being the interest rates used to discount the obligations of the plans, the long-term rates of return on the plans' assets, assumed pay increases, and the health care cost trend rates. Management, along with third-party actuaries and investment managers, reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered. For 2012 expense recognition, the Company will use a discount rate of 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent, and a rate of compensation increase of 4.1 percent and 4.0 percent for the U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. The Company anticipates using an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.0 percent for U.S. plans. For the Canadian plans, the Company will use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.5 percent for the hourly plan and 6.75 percent for all other plans.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined criteria. The Company evaluates the collectibility of trade receivables based on a combination of factors. When aware that a specific customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and an evaluation of current and projected economic conditions at the balance sheet date. Actual collections of trade receivables could differ from management's estimates due to changes in future economic or industry conditions or specific customers' financial conditions.
Recovery of Trade Receivables.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Market Risk
The following discussions about the Company's market risk disclosures involve forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
 
The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.
The fair value of the Company's cash and short-term investment portfolio at April 30, 2011, approximates carrying value. Exposure to interest rate risk on the Company's long-term debt is mitigated due to fixed-rate maturities. In an effort to achieve a mix of variable versus fixed-rate debt under currently favorable market conditions, the Company entered into an interest rate swap in the fourth quarter of 2011 on a portion of fixed-rate Senior Notes. The Company receives a fixed rate and pays variable rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate. The interest rate swap is designated as a fair value hedge and is used to hedge against the changes in the fair value of the debt. The instrument is recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at April 30, 2011, and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense. The change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is offset by the change in the fair value of the long-term debt.
Interest Rate Risk.
Based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended April 30, 2011, including derivatives and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, a hypothetical 10 percent movement in interest rates would not materially affect the Company's results of operations. In measuring interest rate risk by the amount of net change in the fair value of the Company's financial liabilities, a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates at April 30, 2011, would increase the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by approximately $54.0 million.
The Company has operations outside the U.S. with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily denominated in Canadian currency. Because the Company has foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, financial exposure may result, primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates. The foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of April 30, 2011, are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or cash flows.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.
 
The Company utilizes foreign currency exchange forwards and options contracts to manage the price volatility of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash transactions. The contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. Instruments currently used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment and the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in cost of products sold. If the contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, to the extent the hedge is deemed effective, the associated mark-to-market gains and losses are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These gains or losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the contract is executed. The ineffective portion of these contracts is immediately recognized in earnings. Based on the Company's hedged foreign currency positions as of April 30, 2011, a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates would result in a loss of fair value of approximately $4.7 million.
Revenues from customers outside the U.S. represented 10 percent of net sales during 2011. Thus, certain revenues and expenses have been, and are expected to be, subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results.
Raw materials and other commodities used by the Company are subject to price volatility caused by supply and demand conditions, political and economic variables, weather, investor speculation, and other unpredictable factors. To manage the volatility related to anticipated commodity purchases, the Company uses futures and options with maturities generally less than one year. Certain of these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The mark-to-market gains or losses on qualifying hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified to cost of products sold in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The mark-to-market gains or losses on nonqualifying, excluded, and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in cost of products sold immediately.
Commodity Price Risk.
 
The following sensitivity analysis presents the Company's potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent change in market prices.
The estimated fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on the Company's net derivative position by commodity at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that the Company expects to incur. In practice, as markets move, the Company actively manages its risk and adjusts hedging strategies as appropriate. The commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument; thus, the Company would expect that any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of its derivatives would generally be offset by an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures.

(Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted, except per share data)
Note A: Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and its majority-owned investments, if any. Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Principles of Consolidation:
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include: allowances for doubtful trade receivables, estimates of future cash flows associated with assets, asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, accruals for trade marketing and merchandising programs, income taxes, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Use of Estimates:
The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and allowances, when all of the following criteria have been met: a valid customer order with a determinable price has been received; the product has been shipped and title has transferred to the customer; there is no further significant obligation to assist in the resale of the product; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenue Recognition:
 
Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to approximately 26 percent, 27 percent, and 24 percent of net sales in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These sales are primarily included in the two U.S. retail segments. No other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales for any year. Trade receivables at April 30, 2011 and 2010, included amounts due from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries of $87,623 and $61,176, respectively.
Major Customer:
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold.
Shipping and Handling Costs:
In order to support the Company's products, various promotional activities are conducted through retail trade, distributors, or directly with consumers, including in-store display and product placement programs, feature price discounts, coupons, and other similar activities. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when it deems necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by retail trade, distributors, or consumers. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual performance are recognized as a change in management's estimate in a subsequent period. As the Company's total promotional expenditures, including amounts classified as a reduction of net sales, represented approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2011, a possibility exists of materially different reported results if factors such as the level and success of the promotional programs or other conditions differ from expectations.
Trade Marketing and Merchandising Programs:
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $115,066, $130,583, and $77,363 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
Advertising Expense:
Total research and development costs, including product formulation costs, were $20,981, $20,963, and $14,498 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
Research and Development Costs:
 
Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which includes a one-year performance period plus the defined forfeiture period, which is typically four years of service or the attainment of a defined age and years of service.
Share-Based Payments:
The following table summarizes amounts related to share-based payments.
As of April 30, 2011, total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to nonvested share-based awards was approximately $33,703. The weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized is approximately three years.
Corporate income tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings, referred to as excess tax benefits, are presented in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as a financing activity. Realized excess tax benefits are credited to additional capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits, amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings, are first offset against the cumulative balance of excess tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense. For 2011, 2010, and 2009, the actual tax deductible benefit realized from share-based compensation was $7,310, $3,005, and $2,353, including $6,990, $2,908, and $2,372, respectively, of excess tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of share-based compensation, and classified as other-net under financing activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.
 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the applicable tax rate is recognized in income or expense in the period that the change is effective. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained.
Income Taxes:
The Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers. Trade receivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts, reflect the net realizable value of receivables and approximate fair value. The Company evaluates its trade receivables and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. When aware that a specific customer has been impacted by circumstances such as bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position, potentially making it unable to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and an evaluation of current and projected economic conditions at the balance sheet date. Trade receivables are charged off against the allowance after management determines the potential for recovery is remote. At April 30, 2011 and 2010, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,882 and $1,521, respectively. The net provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts increased $361 and $1,091 in 2011 and 2009, respectively, and decreased $480 in 2010. The Company believes there is no concentration of risk with any single customer
Trade Receivables:
 
whose failure or nonperformance would materially affect the Company's results other than as discussed in Major Customer.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for all inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out method.
Inventories:
The cost of finished products and work-in-process inventory includes materials, direct labor, and overhead. Work-in-process is included in finished products in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was $77,594 and $49,214 at April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The Company utilizes derivative instruments such as basis contracts, commodity futures and options contracts, foreign currency forwards and options, and an interest rate swap to manage exposures in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. The Company accounts for these derivative instruments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 815, . FASB ASC 815 requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. For derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are used to hedge an anticipated transaction, changes in fair value are deferred and recognized in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent the hedge is effective and then recognized in the Statements of Consolidated Income in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge effectiveness is measured at inception and on a monthly basis. Any ineffectiveness associated with the hedge or changes in fair value of derivatives that are nonqualifying are recognized immediately in the Statements of Consolidated Income. The Company's interest rate swap is designated as a fair value hedge and is used to hedge against changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The interest rate swap is recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at April 30, 2011, and changes in the fair value are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Income for the year ended April 30, 2011. The change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. By policy, the

Property, plant, and equipment is recognized at cost and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset (3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment, 3 to 7 years for capitalized software costs, and 5 to 40 years for buildings, fixtures, and improvements).
Property, Plant, and Equipment:
The Company leases certain land, buildings, and equipment for varying periods of time, with renewal options. Rent expense in 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $57,572, $55,010, and $36,547, respectively. As of April 30, 2011, the Company's minimum operating lease obligations are as follows: $26,110 in 2012, $21,887 in 2013, $18,956 in 2014, $14,121 in 2015, and $22,565 in 2016 and beyond.
In accordance with FASB ASC 360, long-lived assets, except goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated by the Company to be generated by such assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of by sale are recognized as held for sale at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
Property, Plant, and Equipment,
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company conducts its annual test for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of February 1 of each year. A discounted cash flow valuation technique and a market-based approach are utilized to estimate the fair value of the Company's reporting units. For annual impairment
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:
Intangibles  Goodwill and Other,
 
testing purposes, the Company's reporting units are its operating segments. The discount rates utilized in the analysis are developed using a weighted-average cost of capital methodology. In addition to the annual test, the Company will test for impairment if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. For additional information, see Note G: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Under the Company's investment policy, it may invest in debt securities deemed to be investment grade at the time of purchase for general corporate purposes. The Company determines the appropriate categorization of debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company has categorized all debt securities as available for sale because it currently has the intent to convert these investments into cash if and when needed. Classification of these available-for-sale marketable securities as current or noncurrent is based on whether the conversion to cash is expected to be necessary for operations in the upcoming year, which is currently consistent with the security's maturity date.
Marketable Securities and Other Investments:
Securities categorized as available for sale are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities was $18,600 and was included in other current assets at April 30, 2011. Approximately $57,100, $13,519, and $3,013 of proceeds have been realized upon maturity or sale of available-for-sale marketable securities in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Company uses specific identification to determine the basis on which securities are sold.
The Company also maintains funds for the payment of benefits associated with nonqualified retirement plans. These funds include investments considered to be available-for-sale marketable securities. At April 30, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of these investments was $41,560 and $34,895, respectively, and was included in other noncurrent assets. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at April 30, 2011 and 2010, were unrealized gains of $2,817 and $693, respectively.
 
Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while income and expenses are translated using average rates. Translation adjustments are reported as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Foreign Currency Translation:
In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2010-06, , which requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements including transfers in and out of different levels of the fair value hierarchy and a higher level of disaggregation for different types of financial instruments. These disclosure requirements were effective in the current fiscal year for the Company. In addition to these disclosure requirements, ASU 2010-06 requires information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of Level 3 assets to be presented separately. These additional disclosure requirements will be effective May 1, 2011, for the Company.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards:
Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, ASU 2011-04 provides clarification about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and expands certain other disclosure requirements. This ASU will be effective February 1, 2012, for the Company.

The raw materials used by the Company in each of its segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Glass, plastic, steel cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate are the principle packaging materials used by the Company. The fruit and vegetable raw materials used by the Company in the production of its food products are purchased from independent growers and suppliers. Green coffee, peanuts, edible oils, sweeteners, milk, flour, corn, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The availability, quality, and cost of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. Green coffee is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and
Risks and Uncertainties:
 
price are subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, pest damage, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. Raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although the Company has elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary year to year, the Company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to single-sourced materials are available. The Company has not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials. The Company considers its relationships with key material suppliers to be good.
Approximately 32 percent of the Company's employees, located at 10 facilities, are covered by union contracts. The contracts vary in term depending on the location with three contracts expiring in 2012.
The Company insures its business and assets in each country against insurable risks, to the extent that it deems appropriate, based upon an analysis of the relative risks and costs.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year classifications.
Reclassifications:
Note B: Subsequent Event  Rowland Coffee Acquisition
On May 16, 2011, the Company completed an acquisition of the coffee brands and business operations of Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc. ("Rowland Coffee"), a privately-held company headquartered in Miami, Florida, for $360.0 million. The Company utilized cash on hand and borrowed $180.0 million under its revolving credit facility.
Rowland Coffee is a leading producer of espresso coffee in the U.S., generating total net sales in excess of $110.0 million in calendar 2010. The acquisition strengthens and broadens the Company's leadership in the U.S. retail coffee category by adding the leading Hispanic brands, and , to the Smucker family of brands.

Caf Pilon
The purchase price allocation is in the preliminary stages of the valuation process. The purchase price will be allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
 
upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company will determine the estimated fair values based on independent appraisals, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, such excess will be allocated to goodwill.
Note C: Folgers Merger
On November 6, 2008, the Company merged The Folgers Coffee Company ("Folgers"), previously a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company ("P&G"), with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the terms of the agreement, P&G distributed the Folgers common shares to electing P&G shareholders in a tax-free transaction, which was immediately followed by the conversion of Folgers common stock into Company common shares. As a result of the merger, Folgers became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In the merger, P&G shareholders received approximately 63.2 million common shares of the Company valued at approximately $3,366.4 million. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $3,735.8 million. The transaction with Folgers, a leading producer of retail packaged coffee products in the U.S., is consistent with the Company's strategy to own and market number one brands in North America.
The Folgers purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the merger. The Company determined the estimated fair values based on independent appraisals, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management. The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the excess was allocated to goodwill.
 
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the transaction date.
Folgers goodwill of $1,643.6 million was assigned to the U.S. Retail Coffee and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segments. Of the total goodwill, $1,634.3 million is not deductible for tax purposes.
The purchase price allocated to the identifiable intangible assets acquired is as follows:
The results of operations of the Folgers business are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of the transaction. Had the transaction occurred on May 1, 2008, unaudited, pro forma consolidated results for the year ended April 30, 2009, would have been as follows:
The unaudited, pro forma consolidated results are based on the Company's historical financial statements and those of the Folgers business and do not necessarily indicate the results of
 
operations that would have resulted had the merger been completed at the beginning of the applicable period presented. The unaudited, pro forma consolidated results do not give effect to the synergies of the merger and are not indicative of the results of operations in future periods.
Note D: Restructuring
During 2010, the Company announced its plan to restructure certain operations as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance the long-term strength and profitability of its leading brands. The initiative is a long-term investment to optimize production capacity and lower the overall cost structure and includes capital investments for a new state-of-the-art food manufacturing facility in Orrville, Ohio, and consolidation of coffee production in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Company expects to incur restructuring costs of approximately $190.0 million related to this plan.
In 2011, the Company expanded its restructuring plan and committed to an initiative to improve the overall cost structure of its Canadian pickle and condiments operations by transitioning production to third-party manufacturers in the U.S. The Company expects to incur additional restructuring costs of approximately $45.0 million related to this initiative.
The Company expects total restructuring costs of approximately $235.0 million, of which $107.7 million has been incurred through April 30, 2011. The balance of the costs is anticipated to be recognized over the next three fiscal years.
Upon completion, the restructuring will result in a reduction of approximately 850 full-time positions and the closing of six of the Company's facilities  Memphis, Tennessee; Ste. Marie, Quebec; Sherman, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Dunnville, Ontario; and Delhi Township, Ontario. The Sherman facility closed in April 2011.
 
The following table summarizes the restructuring activity, including the reserves established and the total amount expected to be incurred.
Total restructuring charges of $102.0 million and $5.7 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, were reported in the Statements of Consolidated Income. Of the total restructuring charges, $54.1 million and $3.9 million were reported in cost of products sold in 2011 and 2010, respectively, while the remaining charges were reported in other restructuring costs. The restructuring costs classified as cost of products sold primarily include long-lived asset charges for accelerated depreciation related to property, plant, and equipment that will be used at the affected production facilities until they are closed or sold.
Expected employee separation costs include severance, retention bonuses, and pension costs. Severance costs and retention bonuses are being recognized over the estimated future service period of the affected employees. The obligation related to employee separation costs is included in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on the impact of the restructuring plan on defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see Note H: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.
Other costs include professional fees, costs related to closing the facilities, and miscellaneous expenditures associated with the Company's restructuring initiative and are expensed as incurred.
 
The Company incurred total restructuring costs of approximately $10.2 million in 2009, related to a separate restructuring program completed in 2009, consisting primarily of a $9.1 million noncash defined benefit pension settlement charge.
Note E: Reportable Segments
The Company operates in one industry: the manufacturing and marketing of food products. The Company's reportable segments have been modified to align segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, consistent with the executive appointments announced in March 2011. As a result, the Company now presents the following three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. The new U.S. Retail Consumer Foods reportable segment is a combination of the former U.S. Retail Consumer and U.S. Retail Oils and Baking reportable segments, and the Special Markets segment has been renamed International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. The U.S. Retail Coffee segment represents the domestic sales of and branded coffee to retail customers; the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of and branded products; and the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment is comprised of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, schools and universities, health care operators), and health and natural foods stores and distributors.
Folgers, Dunkin' Donuts,
Millstone
Smucker's, Crisco, Jif, Pillsbury, Eagle Brand, Hungry Jack,
Martha White
In addition, certain specialty brands which were previously included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment are included in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment ("product realignments"). Segment performance for 2011, 2010, and 2009 has been reclassified for these product realignments and the organizational changes described above.
 
The calculation of segment profit was modified at the beginning of 2011 to include intangible asset amortization and impairment charges related to segment assets, along with certain other items in each of the segments. These items were previously considered corporate expenses and were not allocated to the segments. This change more accurately aligns the segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, most notably in the area of intangible assets. Segment profit for 2010 and 2009 has been presented to be consistent with the current methodology.
 
The following table sets forth reportable segment and geographical information.
Segment profit represents revenue less direct and allocable operating expenses.
 
The following table presents product sales information.
Note F: Earnings per Share
In 2010, the Company adopted the two-class method of computing earnings per share as required by FASB ASC 260, . FASB ASC 260 provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method described in FASB ASC 260. The Company's unvested restricted shares contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends and are participating securities. All presented prior period earnings per share data has been adjusted to retrospectively reflect the application of the two-class method. The conversion to the two-class method resulted in a reduction of net income per common share and net income per common share  assuming dilution for the year ended April 30, 2009, of $0.03 and $0.01 per share, respectively.
Earnings Per Share
 
The following table sets forth the computation of net income per common share and net income per common share assuming dilution.

The following table reconciles the weighted-average common shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share disclosures to the total weighted-average shares outstanding.
 
Note G: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
A summary of changes in the Company's goodwill during the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010, by reportable segment is as follows:
The Company's other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization and impairment charges are as follows:
Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $73,438, $72,417, and $38,094 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The weighted-average useful life of the finite-lived
 
intangible assets is 19 years. Based on the amount of intangible assets subject to amortization at April 30, 2011, the estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding five years is approximately $73,000.
Pursuant to FASB ASC 350, the Company is required to review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. The annual impairment review was performed as of February 1, 2011. Goodwill impairment is tested at the reporting unit level which is the Company's operating segments. Impairment of $17,599, $11,658, and $1,491 was recognized related to certain intangible assets in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
The majority of the impairment recognized in 2011 was recognized in the third quarter when the Company became aware of a significant future reduction in its frozen vegetable business with a customer in Canada. This was subsequent to declines in net sales and profit margins of the frozen fruit and vegetable business during 2011. The Company determined that these events constituted a potential indicator of impairment of the indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets recognized in its International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment under FASB ASC 350 and FASB ASC 360, respectively.

The Company determined the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark based on an analysis of the projected cash flows for the brand, discounted at a rate developed using a risk-adjusted, weighted-average cost of capital methodology. As a result, an impairment charge of $3,621 was recognized in 2011 to reduce this trademark to its estimated fair value. During 2010, an impairment charge of $7,282 was recognized related to the trademark after the Company became aware of a significant reduction in the frozen fruit business.

The Company determined that the carrying value of the finite-lived customer relationship intangible asset associated with the business was not recoverable based on the undiscounted projected net cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. The estimated fair value of the customer relationship was then calculated based on a discounted cash flow model which utilized a forecast of future revenues and expenses related to the intangible asset. As a result, an impairment charge of $13,534 was recognized in 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the customer relationship to its estimated fair value. No additional impairment was

Note H: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and Canadian employees. Benefits are based on the employee's years of service and compensation. The Company's plans are funded in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government regulations.
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company sponsors several unfunded, defined postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits to certain retired domestic and Canadian employees. These plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted periodically, and contain other cost-sharing features, such as deductibles and coinsurance. Covered employees generally are eligible for these benefits when they reach age 55 and have attained 10 years of credited service.
Upon completion of the restructuring activity discussed in Note D: Restructuring, approximately 850 full-time positions will be reduced. The Company has included the estimated impact of the planned reductions in measuring the U.S. and Canadian benefit obligation of the pension plans and other postretirement plans at April 30, 2011. As a result, the benefit obligation of the pension plans and other postretirement plans increased by approximately $10,500 and $4,200, respectively. Included in the following tables are charges recognized for termination benefits and curtailment as a result of the restructuring plan. In 2012, the Company expects to recognize additional expense of $1,800 related to a reduction in the expected remaining future service lifetime of certain participants in the Canadian plans. These costs are being recognized over the estimated future service period of the affected participants.
 
The following table summarizes the components of net periodic benefit cost and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
The Company uses a measurement date of April 30 to determine defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits' assets and benefit obligations.
 
The following table sets forth the combined status of the plans as recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table summarizes amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, before income taxes.
 
During 2012, the Company expects to recognize amortization of net actuarial losses and prior service cost of $8,973 and $746, respectively, in net periodic benefit cost.
The following table sets forth the assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations.
For 2012, the assumed health care trend rates are 8.5 percent and 7.0 percent for the U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. The rate for participants under age 65 is assumed to decrease to 5.0 percent in 2019 and 4.5 percent in 2017 for the U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the other postretirement benefits obligation and periodic other postretirement benefits cost reported.
A one-percentage point annual change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect as of April 30, 2011:
 
The following table sets forth selective information pertaining to the Company's Canadian pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
The following table sets forth additional information related to the Company's defined benefit pension plans.
The Company employs a total return on investment approach for the defined benefit pension plans' assets. A mix of equity, fixed-income, and alternative investments is used to maximize the long-term rate of return on assets for the level of risk. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on the defined benefit pension plans' assets, management considers the historical rates of return, the nature of investments, the asset allocation, and expectations of future investment strategies.
 
The following table summarizes the fair value of the major asset classes for the U.S. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans and the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall.
 
 
 
The following table presents a rollforward of activity for Level 3 assets between May 1, 2010 and April 30,2011.
The Company's current investment policy is to have approximately 42 percent of assets invested in equity securities, 39 percent in fixed-income securities, and 19 percent in cash and other investments. Included in equity securities were 317,552 of the Company's common shares at April 30, 2011 and 2010. The market value of these shares was $23,839 at April 30, 2011. The Company paid dividends of $521 on these shares during 2011.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $20 million to the defined benefit pension plans in 2012. The Company expects to make the following benefit payments for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans: $36 million in 2012, $34 million in each of the years 2013 through 2016, and $185 million in 2017 through 2021.
Note I: Savings Plans
The Company sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust ("ESOP") for certain domestic, nonrepresented employees. The Company has entered into loan agreements with the Trustee of the ESOP for purchases by the ESOP of the Company's common shares in amounts not to exceed a total of 1,134,120 unallocated common shares of the Company at any
ESOP:
 
one time. These shares are to be allocated to participants over a period of not less than 20 years.
ESOP loans bear interest at one-half percentage point over prime, are secured by the unallocated shares of the plan, and are payable as a condition of allocating shares to participants. Interest expense incurred on ESOP debt was $127, $115, and $261 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. A contribution to the plan, representing compensation expense, is made annually in the amount sufficient to fund ESOP debt repayment and was $614 in 2009. Due to the payment by the Company of a $5.00 per share one-time special dividend in 2009, no contribution was necessary in 2011 or 2010 to fund ESOP debt repayment. Dividends on unallocated shares are used to reduce expense and were $262, $281, and $1,461 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The principal payments received from the ESOP in 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $735, $761, and $649, respectively.
Dividends on allocated shares are credited to participant accounts and are used to purchase additional common shares for participant accounts. Dividends on allocated and unallocated shares are charged to retained income by the Company.
As permitted by FASB ASC 718, the Company will continue to recognize future compensation using the cost basis as all shares currently held by the ESOP were acquired prior to 1993. At April 30, 2011, the ESOP held 155,986 unallocated and 856,318 allocated shares. All shares held by the ESOP were considered outstanding in earnings per share calculations for all periods presented.
Compensation  Retirement Benefits,
The Company offers employee savings plans for domestic and Canadian employees. The Company's contributions under these plans are based on a specified percentage of employee contributions. Charges to operations for these plans in 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $16,440, $15,625, and $10,900, respectively.
Defined Contribution Plans:
 
Note J: Share-Based Payments
The Company provides for equity-based incentives to be awarded to key employees and non-employee directors. Currently, these incentives consist of restricted shares, restricted stock units, deferred shares, deferred stock units, performance units, and stock options. These awards are administered primarily through the 2010 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan approved by the Company's shareholders in August 2010. Awards under this plan may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units (which may also be referred to as deferred stock units), performance shares, performance units, incentive awards, and other share-based awards. Awards under this plan may be granted to the Company's and its subsidiaries' non-employee directors, consultants, officers, and other employees. Deferred stock units granted to non-employee directors vest immediately. At April 30, 2011, there were 7,600,347 shares available for future issuance under this plan. As a result of this plan becoming effective in November 2010, no further awards will be made under the previously existing equity compensation plans.
Under the 2010 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, the Company has the option to settle share-based awards by issuing common shares from treasury, issuing new Company common shares, or issuing a combination of common shares from treasury and new Company common shares.
The following table is a summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information.
Stock Options:
 
At April 30, 2011, the weighted-average remaining contractual term for stock options outstanding and exercisable was approximately 2.6 years and the aggregate intrinsic value of these stock options was approximately $6,673.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was approximately $13,355, $5,876, and $2,871, respectively.
The following table is a summary of the Company's restricted shares, deferred shares, deferred stock units, and performance units.
Other Equity Awards:
The total fair value of equity awards other than stock options vesting in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was approximately $17,680, $16,273, and $11,117, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares, deferred shares, deferred stock units, and performance units is the average of the high and the low share price on the date of grant. The following table summarizes the weighted-average grant date fair values of the equity awards granted in 2011, 2010, and 2009.
 
The performance units column represents the number of restricted shares received by certain executive officers, subsequent to year end, upon conversion of the performance units earned during the year. Restricted stock generally vests four years from the date of grant or upon the attainment of a defined age and years of service.
Note K: Debt and Financing Arrangements
Long-term debt consists of the following:
On June 15, 2010, the Company issued $400.0 million of 4.50 percent Senior Notes with a final maturity on June 1, 2025. The Senior Notes have a 12-year average maturity. Proceeds from the Senior Notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes. On September 1, 2010, the Company repaid the $10.0 million of 7.94 percent Series C Senior Notes utilizing cash on hand.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company entered into an interest rate swap on the 6.63 percent Senior Notes due November 1, 2018. The notional amount was $376.0 million, converting the Senior Notes from a fixed to a variable-rate basis until maturity. The interest rate swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the underlying debt obligation. The fair value
 
adjustment of the interest rate swap at April 30, 2011, was $4.0 million and was recorded as an increase in the long-term debt balance. For additional information, see Note M: Derivative Financial Instruments.
All of the Company's Senior Notes are unsecured and interest is paid semiannually. Scheduled payments are required on the 5.55 percent Senior Notes, the first of which is $50.0 million on April 1, 2013, and on the 4.50 percent Senior Notes, the first of which is $100.0 million on June 1, 2020.
Interest paid totaled $62,075, $76,461, and $52,918 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. This differs from interest expense due to the timing of payments, amortization of the fair value adjustment on the 6.60 percent Senior Notes prior to maturity, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest capitalized.
On January 31, 2011, the Company's $180.0 million revolving credit facility matured and the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of six banks. The credit facility, which amends and restates in its entirety the $400.0 million credit agreement dated as of October 29, 2009, provides for an unsecured revolving credit line of $600.0 million and matures January 31, 2016. The Company's borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest based on prevailing U.S. Prime Rate, Canadian Base Rate, London Interbank Offered Rate, or Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, as determined by the Company. Interest is payable either on a quarterly basis or at the end of the borrowing term. At April 30, 2011, the Company did not have a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year end, the Company borrowed $240.0 million under its revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including the Rowland Coffee acquisition. For additional information, see Note B: Subsequent Event  Rowland Coffee Acquisition. At April 30, 2011, the Company had standby letters of credit of approximately $7.1 million outstanding.
 
The Company's debt instruments contain certain financial covenant restrictions including consolidated net worth, leverage ratios, and an interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with all covenants.
Note L: Contingencies
The Company, like other food manufacturers, is from time to time subject to various administrative, regulatory, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is a defendant in a variety of legal proceedings. The Company cannot predict with certainty the results of these proceedings or reasonably determine a range of potential loss. The Company's policy is to accrue costs for contingent liabilities when such liabilities are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on the information known to date, the Company does not believe the final outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Note M: Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative transactions. By policy, the Company historically has not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or for speculation.
The Company enters into commodity futures and options contracts to manage the price volatility and reduce the variability of future cash flows related to anticipated inventory purchases of green coffee, edible oils, flour, milk, corn, and corn sweetener. The Company also enters into commodity futures and options contracts to manage price risk for energy input costs, including natural gas and diesel fuel. The derivative instruments generally have maturities of less than one year.
Commodity Price Management:
 
Certain of the derivative instruments associated with the Company's U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segments meet the hedge criteria according to FASB ASC 815 and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The mark-to-market gains or losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent effective, and reclassified to cost of products sold in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Cash flows related to qualifying hedges are classified consistently with the cash flows from the hedged item in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. In order to qualify as a hedge of commodity price risk, it must be demonstrated that the changes in the fair value of the commodity's futures contracts are highly effective in hedging price risks associated with the commodity purchased. Hedge effectiveness is measured at inception and on a monthly basis.
The mark-to-market gains or losses on nonqualifying and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in cost of products sold immediately.
The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards and options contracts to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash payments primarily related to purchases of certain raw materials, finished goods, and fixed assets. The contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. At the inception of the contract, the derivative is evaluated and documented for hedge accounting treatment. Instruments currently used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment and the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in cost of products sold. If the contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, to the extent the hedge is deemed effective, the associated mark-to-market gains and losses are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These gains or losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the contract is executed. The ineffective portion of these contracts is immediately recognized in earnings.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Hedging:
The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage changes in the fair value of its debt. Interest rate swaps mitigate the risk associated with the underlying hedged item. At the inception of the contract, the instrument is evaluated and documented for hedge accounting treatment. The Company's interest rate swap met the criteria to be designated as a fair value hedge. The Company receives a fixed rate and pays variable rates, hedging the underlying debt and the associated changes in the fair value of the debt. The
Interest Rate Hedging:
 
interest rate swap is recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at April 30, 2011, and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense. Gains and losses recognized in interest expense on the instrument have no net impact to earnings as the change in the fair value of the derivative is equal to the change in fair value of the underlying debt.
The following table sets forth the fair value of derivative instruments as recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at April 30, 2011 and 2010.
The Company has elected to not offset fair value amounts recognized for commodity derivative instruments and its cash margin accounts executed with the same counterparty. The Company maintained cash margin accounts of $12,292 and $5,714 at April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, that are included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table presents information on gains recognized on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, all of which hedge commodity price risk.
Included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at April 30, 2011 and 2010, were deferred pre-tax gains of $9,430 and $3,128, respectively. The related tax
 
impact recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $3,430 and $1,134 at April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The entire amount of the deferred gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at April 30, 2011, is expected to be recognized in earnings within one year as the related inventory is sold.
The following table presents the realized and unrealized losses recognized in cost of products sold on derivatives not designated as qualified hedging instruments.
The following table presents the gross contract notional value of outstanding derivative contracts at April 30, 2011 and 2010.
Note N: Other Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
Financial instruments, other than derivatives, that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and trade receivables. With respect to trade receivables, the Company believes there is no concentration of risk with any single customer whose failure or nonperformance would materially affect the Company's results other than as discussed in Major Customer of Note A: Accounting Policies. The Company does not require collateral from its customers. The fair value of the Company's financial instruments, other than its long-term debt, approximates their carrying amounts.
 
The following table provides information on the carrying amount and fair value of the Company's financial instruments.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions.
The following table summarizes the fair values and the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall for the Company's financial assets (liabilities).
 
 
The following tables present the Company's nonfinancial assets adjusted to fair value during the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
 
During 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized fair value adjustments related to the impairment of certain indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets. Other adjustments related to foreign currency exchange and amortization were recognized during the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010.
Note O: Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
 
The following table summarizes domestic and foreign loss and credit carryforwards at April 30, 2011.
The Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Included in the overall valuation allowance is $137 for other deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not those assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance decreased by $146, $5,556, and $864 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, primarily due to the expiration of loss carryforwards that had full valuation allowances.
Deferred income taxes have not been provided on approximately $194,058 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since these amounts are considered to be permanently reinvested. Any additional taxes payable on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if remitted, would be partially offset by domestic tax deductions for foreign taxes paid. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on such undistributed earnings.
Income (loss) before income taxes is as follows:
 
The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate is as follows:
The Company accounts for the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under FASB ASC 740, . FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
Income Taxes
In accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 740, unrecognized tax benefits have been classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as long term, except to the extent payment is
 
expected within one year. The Company recognizes net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to examination of U.S. federal income taxes for years prior to 2008 and, with limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examination of state, local, or foreign income taxes for years prior to 2007. The Company is a voluntary participant in the Compliance Assurance Process ("CAP") offered by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). Through the contemporaneous exchange of information with the IRS, this program is designed to identify and resolve tax positions with the IRS prior to the filing of a tax return, which allows the Company to remain current with its IRS examinations. The Company is currently under a CAP examination for the tax year ending April 30, 2011. During 2011, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS on proposed adjustments resulting from an examination of its federal income tax returns for the years ended April 30, 2008, June 30, 2009, and April 30, 2010. In May 2009, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS on proposed adjustments resulting from an examination of its federal income tax returns for years ended in 2007 and 2006. The agreements did not have a material effect on the Company's effective tax rate or financial position.
Within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the Company could decrease its unrecognized tax benefits by an estimated $1,874, primarily as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations periods.
The Company's unrecognized tax benefits as of April 30, 2011 and 2010, were $20,261 and $15,322, respectively. Of the unrecognized tax benefits, $13,939 and $11,321 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized, as of April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company's accrual for tax-related net interest and penalties totaled $1,792 and $2,289 as of April 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The amount of tax-related net interest and penalties credited to earnings totaled $497, $594, and $1,982 during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
 
A reconciliation of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
Note P: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income is included in the Statements of Consolidated Shareholders' Equity. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
 
Income tax benefit (expense) is determined using the applicable deferred tax rate for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Note Q: Common Shares
The Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation ("Articles") provide that each holder of an outstanding common share is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders except for the following specific matters:
Voting:
 
On the matters listed above, common shares are entitled to 10 votes per share, if they meet the requirements set forth in the Articles. Common shares which would be entitled to 10 votes per share must meet one of the following criteria:
In the event of a change in beneficial ownership, the new owner of that common share will be entitled to only one vote with respect to that share on all matters until four years pass without a further change in beneficial ownership of the share.
Pursuant to a Shareholders' Rights Plan adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on May 20, 2009, one share purchase right is associated with each of the Company's outstanding common shares.
Shareholders' Rights Plan:
Under the plan, the rights will initially trade together with the Company's common shares and will not be exercisable. In the absence of further action by the directors, the rights generally will become exercisable and allow the holder to acquire the Company's common shares at a discounted price if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of the outstanding common shares. Rights held by persons who exceed the applicable threshold will be void. Shares held by members of the Smucker family are not subject to the threshold. If exercisable, each right entitles the shareholder to buy one common share at a discounted price. Under certain circumstances, the rights will entitle the holder to buy shares in an acquiring entity at a discounted price.
The plan also includes an exchange option. In general, if the rights become exercisable, the directors may, at their option, effect an exchange of part or all of the rights, other than rights that have become void, for common shares. Under this option, the Company would issue one common share for each right, in each case subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
 
The Company's directors may, at their option, redeem all rights for $0.001 per right, generally at any time prior to the rights becoming exercisable. The rights will expire June 3, 2019, unless earlier redeemed, exchanged, or amended by the directors.
Note R: Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Financial Information

Note A 
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year classifications.
Operating results for the three-month period ended July 31, 2011, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending April 30, 2012. For further information, reference is made to the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2011.
Note B 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-04, . ASU 2011-04 provides clarification about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and expands certain other disclosure requirements. This ASU will be effective February 1, 2012, for the Company.
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, , which eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders' equity and requires the presentation of net income and other comprehensive income to be in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance does not change the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income. This ASU will be effective May 1, 2012, for the Company and requires retrospective application. Adoption of this guidance will affect the presentation of certain elements of the Company's financial statements, but these changes in presentation will not otherwise have an impact on the financial statements.

Note C 
Rowland Coffee Acquisition
On May 16, 2011, the Company completed an acquisition of the coffee brands and business operations of Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc. ("Rowland Coffee"), a privately-held company headquartered in Miami, Florida, for $362.8 million. The acquisition includes a manufacturing, distribution, and office facility in Miami. The Company utilized cash on hand and borrowed $180.0 million under its revolving credit facility. In addition, the Company incurred one-time costs of $2.4 million to date, that were directly related to the merger and integration of Rowland Coffee, which includes approximately $0.8 million in noncash expense items that were reported in cost of products sold, while the remaining charges were reported in other merger and integration costs in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income. Total one-time costs related to the acquisition are estimated to be between $25.0 million and $30.0 million, including approximately $15.0 million of noncash charges associated with consolidating coffee production currently in Miami, into the Company's existing facilities in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Company expects these costs to be incurred over the next two to four years.
Rowland Coffee is a leading producer of espresso coffee in the U.S., generating total net sales in excess of $110.0 million in calendar 2010. The acquisition strengthens and broadens the Company's leadership in the U.S. retail coffee category by adding the leading Hispanic brands, and , to the Company's family of brands.

The purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company determined the estimated fair values based on independent appraisals, discounted cash flow analyses, and estimates made by management. The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, and as such the excess was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to adjustment following the finalization of the valuation. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
 
Goodwill of $84.9 million and $6.8 million was assigned to the U.S. Retail Coffee and the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segments, respectively, all of which is deductible for tax purposes.
The purchase price allocated to the identifiable intangible assets acquired is as follows:
The results of operations of the Rowland Coffee business are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and include $23.2 million of net sales and $1.7 million of total segment profit included in the U.S. Retail Coffee and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment financial results for the three months ended July 31, 2011. Had the acquisition occurred on May 1, 2010, there would not have been a material impact to consolidated results for the three months ended July 31, 2010.
Note D 
Restructuring
During calendar 2010, the Company announced its plan to restructure its coffee, fruit spreads, and Canadian pickle and condiments operations as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance the long-term strength and profitability of its leading brands. The initiative is a long-term investment to optimize production capacity and lower the overall cost structure. It includes capital investments for a new state-of-the-art food manufacturing facility in Orrville, Ohio, and consolidation of coffee production in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Company's pickle and condiments production will be transitioned to third-party manufacturers.
The Company expects to incur restructuring costs of approximately $235.0 million, of which $127.2 million has been incurred through July 31, 2011. The balance of the costs is anticipated to be recognized over the next three fiscal years.
Upon completion in 2014, the restructuring plan will result in a reduction of approximately 850 full-time positions and the closing of six of the Company's facilities  Memphis, Tennessee; Ste.
 
Marie, Quebec; Sherman, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Dunnville, Ontario; and Delhi Township, Ontario. The Sherman facility closed in April 2011.
The following table summarizes the restructuring activity, including the reserves established and the total amount expected to be incurred.
Total restructuring charges of $19,563 and $27,557 in the three months ended July 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were reported in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income. Of the total restructuring charges, $9,666 and $9,453 were reported in cost of products sold in the three months ended July 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, while the remaining charges were reported in other restructuring costs. The restructuring costs classified as cost of products sold primarily include long-lived asset charges for accelerated depreciation related to property, plant, and equipment that will be used at the affected production facilities until they are closed or sold.
Expected employee separation costs include severance, retention bonuses, and pension costs. Severance costs and retention bonuses are being recognized over the estimated future service period of the affected employees. The obligation related to employee separation costs is included in other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on the impact of the restructuring plan on defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see Note J  Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.
Other costs include professional fees, costs related to closing the facilities, and miscellaneous expenditures associated with the Company's restructuring initiative and are expensed as incurred.
 
Note E 
Share-Based Payments
The Company provides for equity-based incentives to be awarded to key employees and non-employee directors. These incentives are administered primarily through the 2010 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan, and currently consist of restricted shares, restricted stock units, deferred shares, deferred stock units, performance units, and stock options.
The following table summarizes amounts related to share-based payments.
As of July 31, 2011, total compensation cost related to nonvested share-based awards not yet recognized was approximately $46,541. The weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized is approximately 3.6 years.

Note H 
Debt and Financing Arrangements
Long-term debt consists of the following:
In 2011, the Company entered into an interest rate swap on the 6.63 percent Senior Notes due November 1, 2018. The notional amount was $376.0 million, converting the Senior Notes from a fixed to a variable-rate basis until maturity. The interest rate swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the underlying debt obligation. The fair value adjustment of the interest rate swap at July 31, 2011 and April 30, 2011, was $18.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and was recorded as an increase in the long-term debt balance.
Subsequent to July 31, 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreement prior to maturity. As a result of the early termination, the Company received $27.0 million in cash, which included $2.8 million of interest receivable, and will realize a $24.2 million reduction of future interest expense through November 1, 2018. For additional information, see Note M  Derivative Financial Instruments.
All of the Company's Senior Notes are unsecured and interest is paid semiannually. Scheduled payments are required on the 5.55 percent Senior Notes, the first of which is $50.0 million on April 1, 2013, and on the 4.50 percent Senior Notes, the first of which is $100.0 million on June 1, 2020.
On July 29, 2011, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with a group of ten banks. The credit facility, which amends and restates in its entirety the $600.0 million credit agreement dated as of January 31, 2011, provides for an unsecured revolving credit line of $1.0 billion and matures July 29, 2016. The Company's borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest based on prevailing U.S. Prime Rate, Canadian Base Rate, London Interbank Offered Rate, or Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, as determined by the Company. Interest is payable either on a quarterly basis or at the end of the borrowing term. At July 31, 2011, the Company had an outstanding balance of $306.7 million under the revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 1.52 percent. Subsequent to July 31, 2011, the Company borrowed additional funds, bringing the total outstanding balance under the
 
revolving credit facility to $480.0 million at August 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.42 percent.
The Company's debt instruments contain certain financial covenant restrictions including consolidated net worth, a leverage ratio, and an interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with all covenants.

Included above are charges recognized during the three months ended July 31, 2010, for termination benefits and curtailment as a result of the restructuring plan.
Note K 
Comprehensive Income
The following table summarizes the components of comprehensive income.
Note L 
Contingencies
The Company, like other food manufacturers, is from time to time subject to various administrative, regulatory, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is a defendant in a variety of legal proceedings. The Company cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of these proceedings or reasonably determine a range of potential loss. The Company's policy is to accrue costs for contingent liabilities when such
 
liabilities are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on the information known to date, the Company does not believe the final outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Note M 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to market risks, such as changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative transactions. By policy, the Company historically has not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or for speculation.
Commodity Price Management. The Company enters into commodity futures and options contracts to manage the price volatility and reduce the variability of future cash flows related to anticipated inventory purchases of green coffee, edible oils, flour, milk, corn, and corn sweetener. The Company also enters into commodity futures and options contracts to manage price risk for energy input costs, including natural gas and diesel fuel. The derivative instruments generally have maturities of less than one year.
Certain of the derivative instruments associated with the Company's U.S. Retail Consumer Foods and U.S. Retail Coffee segments meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The mark-to-market gains or losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to the extent effective, and reclassified to cost of products sold in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Cash flows related to qualifying hedges are classified consistently with the cash flows from the hedged item in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. In order to qualify as a hedge of commodity price risk, it must be demonstrated that the changes in the fair value of the commodity's futures contracts are highly effective in hedging price risks associated with the commodity purchased. Hedge effectiveness is measured and assessed at inception and on a monthly basis. The mark-to-market gains or losses on nonqualifying and ineffective portions of commodity hedges are recognized in cost of products sold immediately.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Hedging. The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards and options contracts to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash payments primarily related to purchases of certain raw materials, finished goods, and fixed assets. The contracts generally have maturities of less than one year. At the inception of the contract, the derivative is evaluated and documented for hedge accounting treatment. Instruments currently used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment and the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in cost of products sold. If the contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, to the extent the hedge is deemed effective, the associated mark-to-market gains and losses are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
 
(loss) income. These gains or losses are reclassified to earnings in the period the contract is executed. The ineffective portion of these contracts is immediately recognized in earnings.
Interest Rate Hedging. The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage changes in the fair value of its debt. Interest rate swaps mitigate the risk associated with the underlying hedged item. At the inception of the contract, the instrument is evaluated and documented for hedge accounting treatment. The Company's interest rate swap met the criteria to be designated as a fair value hedge. The Company receives a fixed rate and pays variable rates, hedging the underlying debt and the associated changes in the fair value of the debt. The interest rate swap is recognized at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense. Gains and losses recognized in interest expense on the instrument have no net impact to earnings as the change in the fair value of the derivative is equal to the change in fair value of the underlying debt.
Subsequent to July 31, 2011, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreement prior to maturity. For additional information, see Note H  Debt and Financing Arrangements.
The following table sets forth the fair value of derivative instruments recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company has elected to not offset fair value amounts recognized for commodity derivative instruments and its cash margin accounts executed with the same counterparty. The Company maintained cash margin accounts of $4,077 and $12,292 at July 31, 2011 and April 30, 2011, respectively, that are included in other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
The following table presents information on gains and losses recognized on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, all of which hedge commodity price risk.
Included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at July 31, 2011 and April 30, 2011, were deferred pre-tax losses of $2,692 and deferred pre-tax gains of $9,430, respectively. The related tax impact recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income was $979 and $3,430 at July 31, 2011 and April 30, 2011, respectively. The entire amount of the deferred loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at July 31, 2011, is expected to be recognized in earnings within one year as the related commodity is sold.
The following table presents the net realized and unrealized gains recognized in cost of products sold on derivatives not designated as qualified hedging instruments.
The following table presents the gross contract notional value of outstanding derivative contracts.
 
Note N 
Other Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
Financial instruments, other than derivatives, that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and trade receivables. Under the Company's investment policy, it may invest in securities deemed to be investment grade at the time of purchase. The Company determines the appropriate categorization of debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of the Company's financial instruments, other than its long-term debt, approximates their carrying amounts. The following table provides information on the carrying amount and fair value of the Company's financial instruments.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions.
 
The following table summarizes the fair values and the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall for the Company's financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
 
 
Note O 
Income Taxes
Income tax expense increased $8.4 million in the three months ended July 31, 2011, resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate to 33.2 percent, compared to 31.3 percent in the first quarter of 2011. The effective tax rate in the three months ended July 31, 2010, benefited from a favorable federal income tax determination related to a prior year, a higher domestic manufacturing deduction, and lower state income tax expense relative to the three months ended July 31, 2011.
During the three months ended July 31, 2011, the effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due to the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state income taxes.
Within the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the Company could decrease its unrecognized tax benefits by an additional $1.1 million, primarily as a result of expiring statute of limitations periods.
Note P: Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Financial Information
The Company anticipates filing a registration statement on Form S-3 which, when such registration statement becomes effective, will register certain securities described therein, including debt securities which may be guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company may sell debt securities pursuant to the registration statement and, if so, it is expected that such securities would be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by the following 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries of the Company: J.M. Smucker LLC and The Folgers Coffee Company (the "subsidiary guarantors"). Therefore, the Company is providing the following condensed consolidating financial information for the Company, the subsidiary guarantors, and the non-guarantor subsidiaries. The principal elimination entries relate to investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions, including transactions with the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantor subsidiaries. The Company has accounted for investments in subsidiaries under the equity method.
