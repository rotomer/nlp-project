We delivered record sales growth in the quarter including robust contributions from product innovation such as our and seasonal offerings.  As we head into the key holiday period, our strong leading brands are trusted and remain well positioned to meet the varying needs of our consumers, including helping to bring their families together to share memorable meals and moments, commented Richard Smucker, Chief Executive Officer.  Additionally, we are effectively managing this period of significant cost inflation, where our cost of goods sold increased approximately 30 percent for the quarter, yet, we posted gross profit growth.  As always, our focus remains on effectively managing the balance between volume, market share, and profitability, while continuing to invest in our brands.

Net Sales
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
Net sales in the second quarter of 2012 increased $235.0 million, or 18 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2011, due primarily to net price realization across many of the Companys brands.  The Rowland Coffee brands acquired earlier in the year contributed approximately 2 percent to net sales for the second quarter of 2012 and, combined with the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, offset a 1 percent decline in volume, compared to the second quarter of 2011.  Volume gains were realized in baking mixes and peanut butter, but were more than offset by declines in nonbranded beverages,  oils,coffee, andflour.  The overall impact of sales mix was favorable.

Margins
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
Gross profit increased $4.0 million, or 1 percent, in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, and increased $4.6 million, excluding special project costs.  Price increases taken over the past year effectively offset higher commodity costs and contributed to gross profit, while margin contracted as expected.  Gross margin declined from 39.6 percent in the second quarter of 2011 to 33.8 percent in the second quarter of 2012, excluding special project costs.  Significantly higher costs were realized for green coffee in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011.  Costs were also higher for edible oils, flour, milk, sweetener, peanuts, and other raw materials.  The net unfavorable impact of a $4.3 million change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, also impacted gross profit.
While green coffee costs have moderated from earlier in the calendar year, the Company expects that it will continue to recognize considerably higher green coffee costs through the remainder of its fiscal year, compared to the prior year.  Additionally, peanut costs are expected to escalate during the remainder of the year.  Pricing actions to date take into account the Companys current cost expectations through the remainder of the fiscal year.
 
Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses in the second quarter of 2012 increased 6 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2011, but decreased as a percentage of net sales from 17.4 percent to 15.6 percent.  Marketing expenses in the second quarter of 2012, were comparable to the second quarter of 2011.  Over the same period, selling and general and administrative expenses increased 17 percent and 10 percent, respectively, while distribution expenses decreased 1 percent.  The addition of the Rowland Coffee business represented approximately one-half of the overall increase in SD&A expenses.  In addition, higher amortization expense was recognized in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, primarily related to the intangible assets associated with the Rowland Coffee acquisition.

Operating income decreased $28.4 million, or 12 percent, in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011.  Excluding special project costs in both periods, operating income decreased $21.7 million, or 8 percent, and declined from 20.6 percent of net sales in 2011 to 16.0 percent in 2012.  Both operating income measures include a loss of $11.3 million on the divestiture of the  business in 2012.

Interest and Income Taxes
Interest expense increased $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, representing the costs of higher debt outstanding somewhat offset by the benefit of the Companys interest rate swap activities and higher capitalized interest associated with the Companys capital expenditures.  During the second quarter of 2012, the Company terminated two interest rate swaps prior to maturity resulting in a net settlement gain of $17.7 million, to be recognized over the remaining life of the underlying debt instruments, including $0.6 million in the current quarter.
On October 18, 2011, the Company completed a public placement of $750.0 million of 3.5 percent, 10-year Notes.  A portion of the proceeds from the Notes was used to repay borrowings under the Companys revolving credit agreement.  Remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and for funding of acquisitions, including the anticipated acquisition of the majority of Sara Lee Corporations North American foodservice coffee and hot beverage business, expected to close in early calendar 2012.
Income taxes decreased $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2012, reflecting a $28.5 million decrease in income before income taxes and the offsetting impact of an increase in the effective tax rate to 34.1 percent, compared to 32.5 percent in the second quarter of 2011.  The increase in the effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2012 is primarily due to a higher Canadian effective tax rate and an increase in state income tax expense, compared to the second quarter of 2011.

Segment Performance
Effective May 1, 2011, the Companys reportable segments have been modified to align segment financial results with the responsibilities of segment management, consistent with the executive appointments announced in March 2011.  Also effective May 1, 2011, certain specialty brands which were previously included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment are included in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment (product realignments).   Segment performance for 2011 has been reclassified for these product realignments and the organizational changes described above.
The U.S. Retail Consumer Foods reportable segment is a combination of the former U.S. Retail Consumer Market and U.S. Retail Oils and Baking Market reportable segments, adjusted for product realignments.  The former Special Markets segment has been renamed International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment and also reflects product realignments.  The Companys method of calculating segment profit remains consistent with 2011.

U.S. Retail Coffee
 
The U.S. Retail Coffee segment net sales increased 29 percent in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting price increases taken over the last 12 months.  Segment volume decreased 4 percent for the second quarter of 2012, excluding Rowland Coffee, compared to the second quarter of 2011.  Volume declines for the  brand were in line with the overall segment while  packaged coffee experienced a 3 percent decline.  The acquisition of Rowland Coffee contributed approximately $26.7 million to segment net sales, representing 6 percentage points of the segment net sales increase.  Contributing to favorable sales mix in the second quarter of 2012, net sales of  and increased $29.8 million, compared to the second quarter of 2011, also representing 6 percentage points of segment net sales growth, while contributing only 1 percentage point growth to volume.

U.S. Retail Coffee segment profit decreased $9.1 million, or 6 percent, in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the second quarter of 2011, including the unfavorable impact of $7.4 million of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity contracts.  While overall pricing was higher in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, it was more than offset by higher green coffee costs recognized.
Although a portion of the favorable price-to-cost relationship in the first quarter of 2012 reversed in the second quarter as expected, segment profit for the first six months of 2012 is up $18.7 million, or 7 percent.  Higher green coffee costs will continue to be recognized through the remainder of fiscal 2012, compared to 2011, most significantly in the third quarter.
U.S. Retail Consumer Foods
The U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment net sales increased 13 percent in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, primarily reflecting the impact of price increases while volume remained consistent with the prior year.   peanut butter net sales increased 22 percent and volume was up 10 percent in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, reflecting the resumption of promotional activities and incremental demand in advance of the previously announced significant price increase effective earlier this month.   fruit spreads net sales increased 9 percent and volume was up 3 percent during the same period.   brand net sales increased 14 percent as a result of price increases, as volume was down 10 percent in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011.  For the same period, net sales and volume for the  brand increased 10 percent and 2 percent, respectively, as volume gains in baking mixes exceeded declines in flour.  Canned milk net sales increased 6 percent and volume was flat during the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011.

The U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment profit increased $2.8 million, or 2 percent, in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the second quarter of 2011.  Higher raw material costs were recognized in the quarter, most significantly for oils, flour, milk, sweetener, and peanuts.  Peanut costs are expected to escalate during the remainder of the year, with more impact on the Companys results in the fourth quarter.  Selling, distribution, and marketing expenses were also higher, generally in line with the increase in net sales.  Price increases and the net favorable impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity contracts in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the second quarter of 2011, more than offset these higher costs.  Segment profit margin was 18.8 percent in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 20.8 percent in 2011.
International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods
Net sales in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment increased 9 percent in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011.  Excluding the impact of acquisition, divestiture, and foreign exchange, segment net sales increased 6 percent over the same period.  Price increases more than offset a 3 percent decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix.  Volume gains in  beverages,  flour, and  pickles did not fully offset declines in nonbranded beverages, and  coffee.

Excluding the $11.3 million loss on the divestiture of the  business, segment profit decreased $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in marketing expenses in the second quarter of 2012.  Excluding the 4.0 percentage point impact of the loss on the divestiture, segment profit margin was 17.9 percent, compared to 19.9 percent in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Other Financial Results and Measures
Cash provided by operations was $118.2 million and $46.8 million during the second quarter of 2012 and 2011, resulting in $59.9 million and $19.5 million provided during the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The Company typically expects a significant use of cash to fund working capital requirements during the first half of each fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal fruit and vegetable procurement, the buildup of inventories to support the Fall Bake and Holiday period, and the additional increase of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season.  As of October 31, 2011, inventory levels also include an additional buildup in preparation for the coffee production consolidation that is scheduled for later in fiscal 2012 under the Companys previously announced restructuring plan as well as the impact of commodity cost increases on overall higher inventory levels.
During the second quarter of 2011, the Company repurchased 540,900 common shares for approximately $38.9 million under the Companys March 2011 Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, completing the purchase of shares included under the plan.  At October 31, 2011, the Company had 2.5 million common shares remaining for repurchase under its Board of Directors authorization.
Outlook
The Company continues to expect net price realization to result in a significant 2012 net sales increase, compared to 2011.  Including the impact of announced pricing actions, net sales percentage growth is expected to be in the mid-teens for 2012, compared to 2011.  The Company has updated its earnings estimate to include the $11.3 million loss on divesture and incremental interest expense associated with the October issuance of $750.0 million of long-term debt.  Income per diluted share is now expected to range from $4.90 to $5.00, excluding special project costs of $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share.  This outlook does not include the impact of the anticipated acquisition of the majority of Sara Lee Corporations North American foodservice coffee and hot beverage business.  The acquisition is anticipated to close in early calendar 2012 and is not expected to have a material impact on earnings for the current fiscal year.
