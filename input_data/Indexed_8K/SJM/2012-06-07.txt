For Immediate Release
 
The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
 
 
ORRVILLE, Ohio, June 7, 2012  The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended April 30, 2012. Results for the quarter and year ended April 30, 2012, include the operations of Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc. (Rowland Coffee) and the North American foodservice coffee and hot beverage business acquired from Sara Lee Corporation (Sara Lee foodservice business) since the completion of each acquisition on May 16, 2011 and January 3, 2012, respectively.
 
Executive Summary
 
 
 
 
 
We are pleased to have delivered another year of record sales and year-over-year earnings per share growth in a complex macroeconomic environment, commented Richard Smucker, Chief Executive Officer. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in our portfolio of trusted brands, build upon our recent acquisitions, advance our extensive pipeline of innovation, further our supply chain productivity initiatives, and build upon the foundation being laid in China. We are well-positioned for continued growth.
 
While higher food prices continue to pose a challenge to consumers, we believe that softening commodity costs should provide some relief to improve volume. We remain committed to price leadership as demonstrated by our recent six percent price decrease on coffee, said Vince Byrd, President and Chief Operating Officer. In this economic environment, it is important to continue to build our brands for the long term while maintaining our ability to quickly adjust our marketing tactics to meet ever-changing consumer needs.
 
Net Sales
 
 
Amounts may not add due to rounding.
 
Net sales increased 14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions and higher realized prices. The Sara Lee foodservice business and Rowland Coffee acquisitions during the year contributed $97.4 million and $28.4 million to net sales in the fourth quarter of 2012, respectively, and combined represented 11 percentage points of the net sales increase. The impact of sales mix was favorable primarily due to .

Overall volume, excluding acquisitions, was down 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily driven by peanut butter,  baking mixes,and  coffee. The overall volume decline, compared to last years fourth quarter, was generally in line with the Companys expectation of continued weak consumer purchases, attributed mostly to significantly higher retail prices and the competitive environment.

Amounts may not add due to rounding.
 
Gross profit increased $28.8 million, or 7 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, and increased $20.0 million, excluding special project costs, due to acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of 2012, commodity costs were higher, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, most significantly for green coffee and peanuts. The impact of lower volume in the base business more than offset the net benefit of higher prices taken in response to higher costs. Included in overall higher costs, the net effect of the change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts was $5.9 million unfavorable and primarily related to coffee. Gross margin contracted from 36.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 33.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, excluding special project costs.
 
 
Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses decreased 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and decreased as a percentage of net sales from 18.8 percent to 15.8 percent, primarily due to an $11.7 million, or 18 percent, decrease in marketing expenses during the period. A portion of the marketing expense decline was redeployed to trade and consumer promotions, which were reflected as a reduction of net sales. Over the same period, general and administrative and distribution expenses both decreased 3 percent. Contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expenses, incentive compensation costs were lower in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011. Selling expenses increased 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, generally in line with the increase in net sales.
 
Higher amortization expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, primarily related to the intangible assets associated with the Companys recent acquisitions. In addition, noncash impairment charges of $4.6 million were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
Operating income increased $19.5 million, or 12 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011. Excluding special project costs in both periods, operating income increased $15.9 million, or 8 percent, and declined from 16.7 percent of net sales in 2011 to 15.8 percent in 2012.
 
Interest and Income Taxes
Interest expense increased $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, representing the costs of higher debt outstanding, primarily due to the Companys October 2011 public debt issuance. The increased borrowing costs were somewhat offset by the benefit of the Companys interest rate swap activities and higher capitalized interest associated with the Companys capital expenditures.
 
Income taxes increased $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting a $14.0 million increase in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 36.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 36.7 percent in 2011.
 
 
Segment Performance
 
 
U.S. Retail Coffee
The U.S. Retail Coffee segment net sales increased 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, including the realization of higher price. The acquisition of Rowland Coffee contributed approximately $24.0 million to segment net sales, representing 5 percentage points of the segment net sales increase. Segment volume decreased 8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding Rowland Coffee. Volume declined 7 percent for the  brand and 13 percent for  packaged coffee. Coffee volume declines were primarily attributed to a combination of lower consumer purchases in response to higher retail prices, inventory level management by key retailers in anticipation of a price decline, which the Company announced on May 15, 2012, and promotional activities by competitors. Net sales of  and increased $34.7 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and represented 7 percentage points of segment net sales growth, while contributing only 1 percentage point growth to volume.

U.S. Retail Coffee segment profit increased $7.9 million, or 7 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, despite base volume declines, primarily due to lower marketing and distribution costs, and the contribution from Rowland Coffee. The net benefit of higher prices related to higher costs in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, contributed slightly to segment profit.
 
 
U.S. Retail Consumer Foods
The U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment net sales increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, due to the impact of price increases. Segment volume declined 11 percent.  peanut butter net sales increased 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, reflecting price increases over the past year and lower promotional activity, somewhat offset by a 17 percent volume decline. The Company attributed the overall decline in peanut butter volume equally to both consumer response to significantly higher retail prices and lost peanut butter distribution with a key retailer in nonmeasured channels earlier in the fiscal year.  fruit spreads net sales declined 8 percent and volume was down 11 percent during the same period, primarily due to competitive activity.  brand net sales increased 7 percent and volume was down 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011. For the same period, net sales and volume for the  brand decreased 20 percent and 14 percent, respectively, with declines mostly in baking mixes resulting from lower promotional activity in the current year and strong results in the prior year. Canned milk net sales decreased 3 percent and volume decreased 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011.

The U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment profit decreased $6.1 million, or 6 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to volume. Price increases taken earlier in the fiscal year, most notably on peanut butter, more than offset higher commodity costs. Segment selling and marketing expenses were down, however, a noncash impairment charge of approximately $4.6 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to a regional canned milk trademark. Segment profit margin was 19.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 22.1 percent in 2011.
 
International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods
Net sales in the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment increased 47 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestiture, and foreign exchange, segment net sales increased 9 percent over the same period last year led by a 4 percent increase in volume. Volume gains in  and  flour,  beverages, and  fruit spreads and  sandwiches more than offset declines in  beveragesand pickles.

Segment profit increased $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2011, primarily due to lower marketing expenses, the contribution from recent acquisitions, and volume growth. Segment profit margin was 14.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, partially reflecting the acquisition of the lower-margin Sara Lee foodservice business.
 
 
Other Financial Results and Measures
 
 
The significant cash generated in the fourth quarter of 2012 is consistent with the Companys long-term expectation, whereby cash provided by operations in the second half of its fiscal year exceeds the amount in the first half of the year, upon completion of the Companys key Fall Bake and Holiday period. The Company typically expects a significant use of cash to fund working capital requirements during the first half of each fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal fruit procurement, the buildup of inventories to support the Fall Bake and Holiday period, and the additional increase of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season. Cash provided by operating activities was $261.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. However, this compares to cash used by operating activities of $2.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2011, which reflected above average working capital requirements during that period, primarily for inventory and accounts receivable.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company invested $35.9 million to acquire a noncontrolling minority interest in Guilin Seamild Biologic Technology Development Co., Ltd. (Seamild), a privately owned manufacturer and marketer of oats products headquartered in China. Seamild is accounted for as an equity method investment and did not materially impact results for the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
Also during the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company repurchased 3 million common shares under its Board of Directors authorization for approximately $225.3 million. At April 30, 2012, the Company had 3.9 million common shares remaining for repurchase under its Board authorization.
 
 
Outlook
For fiscal 2013, net sales are expected to increase approximately 7 percent, compared to 2012, including an incremental eight-month contribution from the Sara Lee foodservice business. Non-GAAP income per diluted share is expected to range from $5.00 to $5.10, excluding special project costs of approximately $0.50 per diluted share. For fiscal 2013, the Companys definition of special project costs has been expanded to include costs the Company expects to incur related to its initiative to settle certain pension liabilities, which are not related to the Companys current restructuring project.
