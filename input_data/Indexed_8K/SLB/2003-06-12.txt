Each offer (an "Offer" and together, the "Offers") is made upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Tender Offer Document.
 
Pricing
 
The price payable for each series (the "Purchase Price") will be based upon a fixed spread over the yield to maturity of the reference government bond as described in the table below, based on the average of the bid and the offer price for such reference government bond as reported by Bloomberg (pages PXGB and PXUK, as applicable) at 2:00 PM CET on the date which is two business days prior to the applicable expiration date of the Offer for that series using standard market practice.
 
Key Terms of the Offers
 
SSA and SPLC are seeking to retire Bonds for an aggregate Total Consideration not to exceed U.S.$1.4 billion (based on exchange rates on the relevant price determination date).
 
The Offer by SSA for the SSA Series A Bonds expires at 5:00 PM CET on 27 June 2003 unless extended or terminated by SSA. The Offer by SSA for the Series B Bonds and the Offer by SLPC for the SPLC Series A Bonds each expire at 5:00 PM CET on 15 July 2003 unless extended or terminated by SSA or SPLC, respectively.
