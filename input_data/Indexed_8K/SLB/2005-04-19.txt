Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On April 13, 2005, the stockholders of Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V.), a Netherlands Antilles corporation ("Schlumberger"), adopted the Schlumberger 2005 Stock Option Plan (the "2005 Plan") and approved an amendment (the "DSPP Amendment") to the Schlumberger Discounted Stock Purchase Plan (the "DSPP"). The 2005 Plan provides for the grant to Schlumberger employees of stock options covering up to 9,000,000 shares of common stock, and the DSPP Amendment increases the number of shares of common stock available for purchase under the DSPP by 6,000,000 shares. Both the 2005 Plan and the DSPP Amendment were approved by Schlumberger's Board of Directors on January 20, 2005, subject to stockholder approval, and are effective as of that date.
