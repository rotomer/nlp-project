On April 12, 2006, the stockholders of Schlumberger N.V. (Schlumberger Limited), a Netherlands Antilles corporation ("Schlumberger"), approved the amendment and restatement of the Schlumberger 2005 Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan"). The amendments to the Option Plan (1) changed the name of the plan to the Schlumberger 2005 Stock Incentive Plan; (2) provided for the grant of restricted stock and restricted stock units with respect to up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock; (3) provided for certain limits on the vesting or holding period for restricted stock and restricted stock units; (4) provided that restricted stock or restricted stock units may not be granted to executive officers of Schlumberger unless the grants are subject to performance-based vesting; (5) made certain other conforming amendments; and (6) restated the plan in its entirety (such plan, as amended and restated, the "Amended and Restated Plan"). The Amended and Restated Plan was approved by Schlumberger's Board of Directors on January 19, 2006, subject to stockholder approval, and is effective as of that date.
