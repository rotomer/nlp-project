The number of persons constituting the whole Board of Directors shall, until changed at any succeeding general meeting of stockholders
,
be the number so fixed and elected. Directors may be suspended or dismissed at any general meeting of stockholders. A suspension automatically terminates if the person concerned has not been dismissed within 2 months after the day of suspension.

Meetings may be held through telephone conference, video conference or other real time communication allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other or through any other device permitted by then applicable law, and participation in a meeting through any such lawful device or arrangement shall constitute presence at such meetings. The Chairman or, in the absence or disability of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman shall preside at their meetings. In the absence or disability of both the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, such meetings shall be presided over by such person as may be chosen by the Board of Directors.

The first meeting of the Board of Directors following an annual general meeting of stockholders, whether a regular or special meeting of the Board, shall be an organizational meeting for the election of officers of the Company and at which any other matters may also be acted upon by the Board. Meetings may be held at any time without notice if all the directors are present or if those not present and who are entitled to notice under the provisions of this Section waive notice of the meeting in writing before or after the meeting. Matters to be acted upon by the Board at any regular or special meeting need not be specified in the notice thereof.
SECTION 2.5
Action by Directors Without Meeting
When action by the Board of Directors is required or permitted to be taken, action at a meeting may be dispensed with if all commercially reasonable efforts have been taken to notify all the directors and if three fourths of the directors shall consent in writing, by telefax, electronic mail or other communication device to such action taken or being taken, and provided that all directors are promptly notified of such action taken or having been taken.
SECTION 2.6
Quorum
A majority of the whole Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of any business, and the action of the majority of the directors present in person or by proxy, as hereinafter provided, at a meeting at which a quorum is so present shall constitute the action of the Board of Directors.

Such proxy must be another director of the Company, provided, however, that at any meeting of the Board of Directors a director may not act as proxy for more than one director.
 
SECTION 2.7
Vacancies
In the event that the office of any directorbecomes vacant for any reason, the remaining directors (or the remaining director, if there should be only one) may appoint one or more persons to fill the vacancy or vacancies thereby created on the Board of Directors until the next general meeting of stockholders, provided that, if at any time the number of directors then in office shall be reduced to less than a majority of the number constituting the whole Board of Directors, the remaining directors or director shall forthwith call a general meeting of stockholders for the purpose of filling the vacancies on the Board of Directors, and, provided further that in the event that all of the directors are prevented from or are incapable of acting as directors, the Company shall be temporarily managed by any person or persons previously appointed by the Board of Directors so to act, who shall forthwith call a general meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing a Board of Directors.

Meetings may be held through telephone conference, video conference or other real time communication allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other or through any other device permitted by then applicable law, and participation in a meeting through any such lawful device or arrangement shall constitute presence at such meetings.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that, except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement, the Company shall indemnify any such person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person (including claims and counterclaims, whether such counterclaims are asserted by (a) such person, or (b) the Company in a proceeding initiated by such person) only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company.

SECTION 5.2
Indemnification In Actions by or in the Right of the Company
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify any current or former, director or officer of the Company who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or entity against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been finally adjudged to be liable to the Company for improper conduct unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or any other court having appropriate jurisdiction shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement which the court in which the action or suit was brought or such other court having appropriate jurisdiction shall deem proper.

Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate.
SECTION 5.5
Non-Exclusivity of By-Laws
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to the other Sections of this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

SECTION 5.7
Definition of the Company
For purposes of this Article V, references to the Company shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
