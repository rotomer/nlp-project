The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. Upon receipt of instructions (which may be given orally) from the Company, you will as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than one business day after receipt of such instructions, suspend solicitation of offers to purchase until such time as the Company has advised you that such solicitation may be resumed.
     You are authorized to solicit orders for the Notes only in denominations of $1,000 or more (in multiples of $1,000). You are not authorized to appoint subagents or to engage the service of any other broker or dealer in connection with the offer or sale of the Notes without the consent of the Company; provided, however, the Purchasing Agent may engage the service of any other broker or dealer without the consent of the Company. The Purchasing Agent will, however, on a periodic basis, provide the Company with a listing of those brokers or dealers so engaged.

The Purchasing Agent and the other Agents will share the Concession in such proportions as they may agree.
Zero-Coupon Note
     Except as provided in Section IV(b) hereof, in soliciting offers to purchase Notes from the Company, you are acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal. If acting on behalf of the Company on an agency basis, you will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company, but you shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase is not consummated for any reason, other than to repay to the Company any Concession with respect thereto.
     (b)  Purchases as Principal. Each sale of Notes to an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a separate agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, to be entered into on behalf of such Agent(s) by the Purchasing Agent, which will provide for the sale of such Notes to, and the purchase and reoffering thereof by, the Purchasing Agent as principal. Each such separate agreement (which may be an oral agreement and confirmed in writing as described below between the Purchasing Agent and the Company) is herein referred to as a "". A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent's agreement to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Except pursuant to a Terms Agreement, under no circumstances shall you be obligated to purchase any Notes for your own account. Each Terms Agreement, whether oral (and confirmed in writing which may be by facsimile transmission) or in writing, shall describe the Notes to be purchased pursuant thereto by the Purchasing Agent as principal, and may specify, among other things, the principal amount of Notes to be purchased, the interest rate or formula and maturity date or dates of such Notes, the interest payment dates, if any, the price to be paid to the Company for such Notes, the initial public offering price at which the Notes are proposed to be reoffered, and the time and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes (the ""), whether the Notes provide for a survivor's option or for optional redemption by the Company and on what terms and conditions, and any other relevant terms.

Terms Agreement
Settlement Date
     In connection with the resale of the Notes purchased, without the consent of the Company, you are not authorized to appoint subagents or to engage the service of any other broker or dealer, nor may you reallow any portion of the discount paid to you by the Company in excess of the designated reallowance portion; provided, however, that the Purchasing Agent may engage the service of any other broker or dealer without the consent of the Company. The Purchasing Agent will however, on a periodic basis, provide the Company with a listing of those brokers or dealers so engaged. Unless authorized by the Purchasing Agent in each instance, each Agent agrees not to purchase and sell Notes for which an order from a client has not been received.
 
     Each purchase of Notes by the Purchasing Agent from the Company shall be at a discount from the principal amount of each such Note on the date of issue not in excess of the applicable Concession set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Zero-Coupon Notes, each purchase of Zero-Coupon Notes by the Purchasing Agent from the Company shall be at a discount from the initial offering price of each such Note on the date of issue not in excess of the applicable Concession set forth in Exhibit A hereto.
     (c)  Public Offering Price. Unless otherwise authorized by the Company, all Notes shall be sold to the public at a purchase price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, with the exception of Zero-Coupon Notes. Zero-Coupon Notes shall be sold to the public at a purchase price no greater than an amount, expressed as a percentage of the principal face amount of such Notes, equal to (i) the net proceeds to the Company on the sale of such Notes, plus (ii) the Concession, plus (iii) accrued interest, if any. Such purchase price shall be set forth in the confirmation statement of the Selling Group (as defined in Exhibit B) member responsible for such sale, and delivered to the purchaser along with a copy of the Prospectus (if not previously delivered) and Pricing Supplement.
     (d)  Procedures. Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of, and the solicitation of offers to purchase and payment for, the Notes, whether under Section IV(a) or IV(b) of this Agreement, are set forth in the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit B, as amended from time to time (the "").

     (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless you, each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) you and each of your and such controlling person's officers and directors against any and all losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) to which any of them may become subject (including all reasonable legal and other costs of investigating, disputing or defending any such claim or action), insofar as such losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable for any such loss, liability, cost, action or claim arising from any statements or omissions made in reliance on and in conformity with written information provided by you through the Purchasing Agent to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (b)  Each Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, and the Company's and such controlling person's officers and directors from and against any and all losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) to which any of them may become subject (including all reasonable legal and other costs of investigating, disputing or defending any such claim or action), insofar as such losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein.
     (c)  If any claim, demand, action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or alleged against an indemnified party in respect of which indemnity is to be sought against an indemnifying party pursuant to the preceding paragraphs, the indemnified party shall, promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any such claim, demand, action or proceeding, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such claim, demand, action or proceeding, enclosing a copy of all papers served, if any; provided, that, the omission to so notify such indemnifying party will not relieve
 
the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provisions of this Section VI unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section VI for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of such proceeding and has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate law firm (in addition to local counsel where reasonably necessary) for all such indemnified parties. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section VI is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under the preceding paragraphs of this Section VI in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) of Section VI were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d) of Section VI. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) of Section VI shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d) of Section VI, no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Notes purchased by it in the offering giving rise to the damages were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) of Section VI to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
     (e)  The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section VI and the representations and warranties of the Company and you in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any termination of this Agreement; (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents; (iii) any investigation by an indemnified party or on such party's behalf or any person controlling an indemnified party or by or on behalf of the indemnifying party, its directors or officers or any person controlling the indemnifying party; and (iv) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
     This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the Agents, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, upon the giving of five (5) business days written notice of such termination to the other party. In the event of any such termination, neither party shall have any liability to the other party hereto, except for obligations hereunder which expressly survive the termination of this Agreement and except that, if at the time of termination an offer for the purchase of Notes shall have been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto shall not yet have occurred, the Company shall have the obligations provided herein with respect to such Note or Notes.
 
     Subsequent to the execution of a Terms Agreement, (i) the Purchasing Agent may terminate such Terms Agreement, and (ii), if the Purchasing Agent does not elect to terminate such Terms Agreement pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, upon the request of an Agent with respect to Notes to be purchased through the Purchasing Agent by such Agent, the Purchasing Agent shall terminate such Terms Agreement to the extent of the Notes that were to be purchased through the Purchasing Agent by such requesting Agent, in each case immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if there shall have occurred:
 
     If this Agreement is terminated, the last sentence of the second paragraph of Section IV(a), Sections III(c), (d) and (e), Section VI, and the first paragraph of Section XII shall survive; provided, that, if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of Section III(a) and (b), and Section IV(b) and (d) shall also survive until time of delivery.
     Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to you shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered in person or sent by telex, facsimile transmission (confirmed in writing), or registered mail to you at your address, telex or telecopier number set forth below by your signature and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by telex, telecopier or registered mail to the Company at SLM Corporation, 11600 Sallie Mae Drive, Reston, Virginia 20193, Attention: Corporate Finance, telecopier number: 703-810-7728, with a copy to: SLM Corporation, 11600 Sallie Mae Drive, Reston, Virginia 20193, Attention: General Counsel's Office, telecopier number: 703-810-7568. All such notices shall be effective on receipt.
     This Agreement shall be binding upon you and the Company, and inure solely to the benefit of you and the Company and any other person expressly entitled to indemnification hereunder and the respective personal representatives, successors and assigns of each, and no other person shall acquire or have any rights under or by virtue of this Agreement.
     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding against it arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered against it in connection with this Agreement may be brought in any Federal or New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, such party hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the jurisdiction of each of the aforesaid courts in personam, generally and unconditionally with respect to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, assets and revenues. Each party hereby also irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
 
     If this Agreement is executed by or on behalf of any party, such person hereby states that at the time of the execution of this Agreement he has no notice of revocation of the power of attorney by which he has executed this Agreement as such attorney.
     The Company will pay the expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement; (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Notes; (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and auditors, of the Trustee and of any paying agents appointed by the Company; (iv) the printing and delivery to you in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (v) if the Company lists Notes on a securities exchange, the costs and fees of such listing; and (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes.
     This Agreement may be executed by each of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, and by each of the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
     As used herein, "business day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to be closed in the City of New York.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof, and upon acceptance hereof by you, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and you.

Dear Selected Dealer:

You agree that in selling Securities pursuant to any Offering (which agreement shall also be for the benefit of the issuer or other seller of such Securities) you will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, the applicable rules and regulations of the NASD, the applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange having jurisdiction over the Offering and the applicable laws, rules and regulations specified in Section 3(b) hereof.
     (i)  Registration of the Securities. You are aware that no action has been or will be taken by the issuer of the Securities that would permit the offer or sale of the Securities or possession or distribution of the Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Securities in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required, other than registering the Securities under the Securities Act in the case of a Registered Offering. Accordingly, you agree that you will observe all applicable laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in or from which you may directly or indirectly acquire, offer, sell, or deliver Securities or have in your possession or distribute the Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Securities, and you will obtain any consent, approval or permission required by you for the purchase, offer, or sale by you of the Securities under the laws and regulations in force in any such jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer, or sale. Neither the issuer of the Securities nor AAFS or any Selected Dealers or Underwriters shall have any responsibility for determining what compliance is necessary by you or for your obtaining such consents, approvals, or permissions. You further agree that you will take no action that will impose any obligations on the issuer of the Securities, AAFS, or any Selected Dealers or Underwriters. Subject as provided above, you shall, unless prohibited by applicable law, furnish to each person to whom you offer, sell or deliver Securities a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) or (unless delivery of the Prospectus is required by applicable law) inform each such person that a copy thereof (as then amended or supplemented) will be made available upon request. You are not authorized to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference or specifically referred to therein in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities.

Losses

Such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     The indemnity agreements contained in this Section and the representations and warranties by you in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any termination of this Agreement; (ii) any investigation made by an indemnified party or on such party's behalf or any person controlling an indemnified party or by or on behalf of the indemnifying party, its directors or officers or any person controlling the indemnifying party; and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any Securities.
     5.     Termination, Supplements and Amendments. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and supercedes all prior oral or written agreements between the parties hereto or their predecessors with regard to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be terminated by Written Communication from you to AAFS or from AAFS to you. Until so terminated, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may be supplemented or amended by us by written notice thereof to you, and any such supplement or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective with respect to any Offering to which this Agreement applies after the date you received such supplement or amendment. Each reference to "this Agreement" herein shall, as appropriate, be
 
to this Agreement as so amended and supplemented. The terms and conditions set forth in Section 3(c) hereof with regard to any Offering will terminate at the close of business on the 30th day after the commencement of the public offering of the Securities to which such Offering relates, but in our discretion may be extended by us for a further period not exceeding 30 days and in our discretion, whether or not extended, may be terminated at any earlier time.
     6.     Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and other persons specified in Section 1 hereof, and the respective successors and assigns of each of them.
     7.     Governing Law. This Agreement and the terms and conditions set forth herein with respect to any Offering together with such supplementary terms and conditions with respect to such Offering as may be contained in any Written Communication from us to you in connection therewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or portions thereof) that have been accepted pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option during such year has not exceeded the Annual Put Limitation, if applied, for such year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to this Note (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened the Individual Put Limitation, if applied, with respect to an individual deceased owner of beneficial interests therein will be accepted in the order all such Notes (or portions thereof) were tendered, to the extent that any such exercise would not trigger the Annual Put Limitation for such calendar year.
          C. This Note (or any portion hereof) accepted for payment pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option will be repaid on the earlier of the June 15 and December 15 following such acceptance so long as repayment occurs at least twenty (20) calendar days after the date of acceptance. If the date of repayment is not a Business Day, payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day.
          D. In the event that this Note (or any portion hereof) tendered for repayment pursuant to the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted because of the Annual Put Limitation or the Individual Put Limitation, the EdNotes Trustee will deliver a notice by first-class mail to the Representative who tendered such Note for repayment, at the address identified by the Representative in connection with such tender, or in the case of a tender by a Representative that has not made such Representative's mailing address known to the EdNotes Trustee, to the registered holder of this Note at its last known address as indicated in the register for the Notes, or in the case of Notes represented by Global Securities, to the broker or other
 
entity through which the beneficial interest in this Note is held by the deceased owner, which notice states the reason such Note (or portion thereof) has not been accepted for payment.
          E. The Representative may withdraw the tender of this Note (but only with respect to any portion of this Note that was not paid because of the application of the Annual Put Limitation or the Individual Put Limitation) prior to the earlier of (i) the date that is ninety (90) days from the date of receipt by the Representative of notice from the EdNotes Trustee of the foregoing notice of non-acceptance of the tender of this Note (or any portion thereof) or (ii) the regular record date for the next scheduled interest payment date, if any, on this Note.
          F. If this Note (or any portion hereof) tendered for repayment is not accepted in any calendar year due to the application of the Annual Put Limitation or the Individual Put Limitation, it will be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order in which all Notes subject to the Survivor's Option (or portions thereof) were originally tendered, unless this Note (or portion thereof) is withdrawn by the Representative for the deceased owner.
     VI.     . The death of a person owning this Note in joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety with another or others will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of this Note, and the entire principal amount of this Note so held will be subject to repayment, together with interest accrued thereon to the repayment date. The death of a person owning this Note by tenancy in common will be deemed the death of a holder of this Note only with respect to the deceased holder's interest in this Note so held by tenancy in common; except that in the event this Note is held by a husband and wife as tenants in common, the death of either will be deemed the death of the holder of this Note, and the entire principal amount of this Note will be subject to repayment. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of this Note will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner thereof for the purpose of this provision, regardless of the registered holder, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the EdNotes Trustee and the Company. Such beneficial ownership will be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife and trust arrangements where one person has substantially all of the beneficial ownership interest in this Note during his or her lifetime.

This Note is designated as a Medium Term Note, Series B due ______, 20______. The Interest Accrual Period for each Interest Payment Date begins on each Interest Payment Date and ends on the calendar day before the next Interest Payment Date, that the first Interest Accrual Period begins on ______, 20______and ends on ______, 20______, the calendar day before the first Interest Payment Date. Commencing with the first Interest Determination Date, and thereafter on each succeeding Interest Determination Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable will be adjusted. Each such adjusted rate will be applicable to the Interest Accrual Period to which it relates. Unless otherwise set forth in the pricing supplement applicable to a particular issuance of Notes (""), interest will be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Interest Accrual Period. All percentages resulting from any calculations will be carried to five decimal places (that is, to the one hundred-thousandths place), with five one-millionths being rounded upwards, if necessary. In addition, the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate, if any, permitted by applicable law.
provided
Pricing Supplement
Subject to applicable law and except as specified in this Note, the rate of interest on this Note for each Interest Accrual Period after the first will be the Commercial Paper Rate for the Index Maturity [plus][minus] the Spread (all as specified on the face of this Note).
The EdNotes Trustee will calculate the interest payable on this Note in accordance with the foregoing and will confirm in writing such calculation to the Company and the EdNotes Paying Agent (if other than the EdNotes Trustee) immediately after each determination. All
 
determinations made by the EdNotes Trustee will be, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holders of the Notes. At the request of the Holder, the EdNotes Trustee will provide to the Holder the interest rate on this Note then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective as of the next Interest Accrual Period. Unless otherwise set forth in the Pricing Supplement, the "calculation agent" will be the Company.
The Commercial Paper Rate for any relevant Interest Determination Date equals the Bond Equivalent Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on such date for commercial paper having the index maturity specified on the face of this Note, as published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date under the heading "Commercial Paper  Financial."
If the Commercial Paper Rate described above is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination Date, then the commercial paper rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on the relevant Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face of this Note, as published in H.15 Daily Update or any other recognized electronic source used for displaying that rate under the heading "Commercial Paper  Financial." H.15 Daily Update is the daily update for H.15(519), available through the world wide web site of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H15/update, or any successor site or publications. The bond equivalent yield will be calculated as follows:
where "D" refers to the per annum rate determined as set forth above, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and "N" refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be.
If the Commercial Paper Rate described in the prior paragraph cannot be determined, the Commercial Paper Rate will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
If this Note is subject to a lock-in period, such lock-in period will be set forth in the applicable pricing supplement.
If no redemption right is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may not be redeemed at the option of the Company prior to the Maturity Date. If a redemption right is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may be redeemed at the option of the Company on any Business Day on and after the date, if any, specified on the face of this Note (each, a "").

Redemption Date
 
If no repayment right by Survivor's Option is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may not be repaid at the option of the Holder prior to the Maturity Date. If a repayment right by Survivor's Option is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note will be repayable in whole or in part on the terms set forth in the Survivor's Option Rider attached to this Note.
In the event of redemption or repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor in the aggregate principal amount to and in exchange for the portion of this Note that is not redeemed or repaid will be issued in the name of the Holder of this Note upon its cancellation.
As described on the face of this Note, the entire principal amount of this Note (except if this Note is Original Issue Discount, as described below) will be due and payable on the Maturity Date, which amount includes accrued amortization of original issue discount, if any. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the EdNotes Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Notes, by notice to the Company and the EdNotes Trustee, may declare the principal of all the Notes due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
If this Note is specified on the face of this Note to be Original Issue Discount, the amount of principal payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment upon exercise of Survivor's Option or acceleration of maturity will be such portion of the principal amount as may be specified, or determined as specified, in the terms of the Notes and in the Pricing Supplement, with the amount of interest payable equal to any unpaid interest accrued on this Note to, but not including, the Redemption Date, date of repurchase upon exercise of Survivor's Option or date of acceleration of maturity, as applicable.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as provided in the Indenture, the amendment of the Indenture and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes at any time by the Company and the EdNotes Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note will be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer of, exchange for or substitution of this Note, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have given, made or taken any action under the Indenture, the principal amount of any Note that is Original Issue Discount which is deemed to be outstanding will be the amount of the principal of such Note which would be due and payable if the maturity date of such Note had been accelerated to such date.
Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference in this Note to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or the Indenture will alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
 
unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, prescribed in this Note.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, and this Note duly executed by, the Holder of this Note or by his attorney duly authorized in writing and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denomination as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to the due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the EdNotes Trustee and any agent of the Company or the EdNotes Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner of this Note for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the EdNotes Trustee nor any such agent will be affected by notice to the contrary.

Unless otherwise provided in the pricing supplement applicable to a particular issuance of Notes (""), interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Interest Accrual Period. All percentages resulting from any calculations will be carried to five decimal places (that is, to the one hundred-thousandths place), with five one-millionths being rounded upwards, if necessary.

Pricing Supplement
Subject to applicable law and except as specified in this Note, the rate of interest on this Note for each Interest Accrual Period after the first will be ______-month LIBOR, [plus] [minus] the Spread (all as shown on the face of this Note). Interest for the first Interest Accrual Period will be [______].
The EdNotes Trustee will calculate the interest payable on this Note in accordance with the foregoing and will confirm in writing such calculation to the Company and the EdNotes Paying Agent (if other than the EdNotes Trustee) immediately after each determination. All determinations made by the EdNotes Trustee will be, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive
 
for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holders of the Notes. At the request of the Holder, the EdNotes Trustee will provide to the Holder the interest rate on this Note then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective as of the next Interest Accrual Period. Unless otherwise set forth in the Pricing Supplement, the "calculation agent" will be the Company.
[______-month] LIBOR, for any Interest Accrual Period, is the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having a maturity equal to the Index Maturity, commencing on the first day of the Interest Accrual Period, which appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. London time, on the related Interest Determination Date. If this rate does not appear on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750, the rate for that day will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars, having the Index Maturity and in a principal amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000, are offered at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market by the Reference Banks.

The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each Reference Bank to provide a quotation of its rate. If the Reference Banks provide at least two quotations, the rate for that day will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If the Reference Banks provide fewer than two quotations, the rate for that day will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by major banks in New York City, selected by the calculation agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Interest Determination Date, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having the Index Maturity and in a principal amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000.

     This is one of the Notes referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of notes of the Company issued and to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of October 1, 2000 (the ""), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee, and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 16, 2003 (the ""), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the ""), for the Medium Term Notes, Series B, also known as "EdNotes" (the "") (the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, as amended or supplemented from time to time, collectively, the "").

Indenture
This Note is designated as a Medium Term Note, Series B due ________, 20____. The Interest Accrual Period for each Interest Payment Date begins on each Interest Payment Date and ends on the calendar day before the next Interest Payment Date, that the first Interest Accrual Period begins on ________ __, 20__ and ends on ________ __, 20__, the calendar day before the first Interest Payment Date. Commencing with the first Interest Determination Date, and thereafter on each succeeding Interest Determination Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable will be adjusted. Each such adjusted rate will be applicable to the Interest Accrual Period to which it relates. Unless otherwise set forth in the pricing supplement applicable to a particular issuance of Notes (""), interest will be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Interest Accrual Period. All percentages resulting from any calculations will be carried to five decimal places (that is, to the one hundred-thousandths place), with five one-millionths being rounded upwards, if necessary. In addition, the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate, if any, permitted by applicable law.
provided
Pricing Supplement
Subject to applicable law and except as specified in this Note, the rate of interest on this Note for each Interest Accrual Period after the first will be the Prime Rate in effect, [plus] [minus] the Spread (all as shown on the face of this Note).
The EdNotes Trustee will calculate the interest rate on this Note in accordance with the foregoing and will confirm in writing such calculation to the Company and the EdNotes Paying Agent (if other than the EdNotes Trustee) immediately after each determination. All
 
determinations made by the EdNotes Trustee will be, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holders of the Notes. At the request of the Holder, the EdNotes Trustee will provide to the Holder the interest rate on this Note then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective as of the next Interest Accrual Period. Unless otherwise set forth in the Pricing Supplement, the "calculation agent" will be the Company.
The Prime Rate for any relevant Interest Determination Date is the prime rate or base lending rate, as published on that Interest Determination Date, in the Money Rates Table in the Credit Markets Section of the Wall Street Journal.
If the Prime Rate cannot be determined because it is not published in the "Money Rates Table" in the "Credit Markets Section" of the Wall Street Journal on the relevant Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate for that Interest Determination Date as published in H15(519) on that Interest Determination Date under the heading "Bank Prime Loan". H.15(519) is the weekly statistical release designated as such, or any successor publication, published by the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve System.
If the Prime Rate cannot be determined because it is not published in H.15(519) prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time on the relevant Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate for that Interest Determination Date, as published in H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source for displaying such rate opposite the caption "Bank Prime Loan." H.15 Daily Update is the daily update for H.15(519), available through the world wide web site of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H15/update, or any successor site or publications.
If the Prime Rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source for displaying such rate by 3:00 p.m., New York City time on the relevant Interest Payment Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen designated as "USPRIME1" as that bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect on that Interest Determination Date. USPRIME1 means the display designated as page "USPRIME1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the US Prime1 page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks).
If no rates appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 page on the relevant Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates (quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360) as of the close of business on that Interest Determination Date by at least three major banks in New York City. If the banks are not quoting as described in the immediately preceding sentence, the Prime Rate in effect immediately prior to such Interest Determination Date will not change and will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
If this Note is subject to a lock-in period, such lock-in period will be set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
 
If no redemption right is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may not be redeemed at the option of the Company prior to the Maturity Date. If a redemption right is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may be redeemed at the option of the Company on any Business Day on and after the date, if any, specified on the face of this Note (each, a ""). This Note may be redeemed on any Redemption Date in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed (except if this Note is Original Issue Discount, as described below), together with interest on this Note payable to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, on notice given by the Company to the EdNotes Trustee at least ten (10) days prior to the proposed Redemption Date and to the Holder of this Note at least five (5) days prior to the proposed Redemption Date.
Redemption Date
If no repayment right by Survivor's Option is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may not be repaid at the option of the Holder prior to the Maturity Date. If a repayment right by Survivor's Option is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note will be repayable in whole or in part on the terms set forth in the Survivor's Option Rider attached to this Note.
In the event of redemption or repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor in the aggregate principal amount to and in exchange for the portion of this Note that is not redeemed or repaid will be issued in the name of the Holder of this Note upon its cancellation.
As described on the face of this Note, the entire principal amount of this Note (except if this Note is Original Issue Discount, as described below) will be due and payable on the Maturity Date, which amount includes accrued amortization of original issue discount, if any. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the EdNotes Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Notes, by notice to the Company and the EdNotes Trustee, may declare the principal of all the Notes due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
If this Note is specified on the face of this Note to be Original Issue Discount, the amount of principal payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment upon exercise of Survivor's Option or acceleration of maturity will be such portion of the principal amount as may be specified, or determined as specified, in the terms of the Notes and in the Pricing Supplement, with the amount of interest payable equal to any unpaid interest accrued on this Note to, but not including, the Redemption Date, date of repurchase upon exercise of Survivor's Option or date of acceleration of maturity, as applicable.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as provided in the Indenture, the amendment of the Indenture and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes at any time by the Company and the EdNotes Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note will be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon future Holders of
 
this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer of, exchange for or substitution of this Note, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have given, made or taken any action under the Indenture, the principal amount of any Note that is Original Issue Discount which is deemed to be outstanding will be the amount of the principal of such Note which would be due and payable if the maturity date of such Note had been accelerated to such date.
Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference in this Note to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or the Indenture will alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, prescribed in this Note.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, and this Note duly executed by, the Holder of this Note or by his attorney duly authorized in writing and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denomination as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to the due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the EdNotes Trustee and any agent of the Company or the EdNotes Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner of this Note for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the EdNotes Trustee nor any such agent will be affected by notice to the contrary.

This Note is one of a duly authorized series of notes of the Company issued and to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of October 1, 2000 (the ""), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 16, 2003 (the ""), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee () for the Medium Term Notes, Series B, also known as "EdNotes" (the "") (the Base Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, as amended or supplemented from time to time, collectively, the "").

Indenture
This Note is designated as a Medium Term Note, Series B due _________, 20__. The Interest Accrual Period for each Interest Payment Date begins on each Interest Payment Date and ends on the calendar day before the next Interest Payment Date, that the first Interest Accrual Period begins on _________, 20__and ends on ___________ __, 20__, the calendar day before the first Interest Payment Date. Commencing with the first Interest Determination Date, and thereafter on each succeeding Interest Determination Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable will be adjusted. Each such adjusted rate will be applicable to the Interest Accrual Period to which it relates. Unless otherwise set forth in the pricing supplement applicable to a particular issuance of Notes (""), interest will be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed in the applicable Interest Accrual Period. All percentages resulting from any calculations will be carried to five decimal places (that is, to the one hundred-thousandths place), with five one-millionths being rounded upwards, if necessary. In addition, the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate, if any, permitted by applicable law.
provided
Pricing Supplement
Subject to applicable law and except as specified in this Note, the rate of interest on this Note for each Interest Accrual Period after the first will be the 91-Day Treasury Bill Rate on the applicable Interest Determination Date [plus] [minus] the Spread (all as shown on the face of this Note).
The EdNotes Trustee will calculate the interest payable on this Note in accordance with the foregoing and will confirm in writing such calculation to the Company and the EdNotes Paying
 
Agent (if other than the EdNotes Trustee) immediately after each determination. All determinations made by the EdNotes Trustee will be, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and Holders of the Notes. At the request of the Holder, the EdNotes Trustee will provide to the Holder the interest rate on this Note then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective as of the next Interest Accrual Period. Unless otherwise set forth in the Pricing Supplement, the "calculation agent" will be the Company.
The 91-Day Treasury Bill Rate for any relevant Interest Determination Date is the rate equal to the weighted average per annum discount rate (expressed as a bond equivalent yield and applied on a daily basis) for direct obligations of the United States with a maturity of thirteen weeks, i.e. 91-day Treasury bills, sold at the applicable 91-day Treasury bill auction, as published in H.15(519) or otherwise or as reported by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
In the event that the results of auctions of 91-day Treasury bills cease to be published or reported as provided above, or that no 91-day Treasury bill auction is held in a particular week, then the 91-day Treasury bill rate in effect as a result of the last such publication or report will remain in effect until such time, if any, as the results of auctions of 91-day Treasury bills will again be so published or reported or such auction is held, as the case may be.
Unless otherwise set forth in the Pricing Supplement, the 91-Day Treasury Bill Rate will be subject to a lock-in period of six Business Days prior to each Interest Payment Date. If the rate is subject to a lock-in period, the interest rate or other calculations in effect on the sixth Business Day prior to the Interest Payment Date will be the rate or other such calculation in effect for the remainder of such Interest Accrual Period.
If no redemption right is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may not be redeemed at the option of the Company prior to the Maturity Date. If a redemption right is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may be redeemed at the option of the Company on any Business Day on and after the date, if any, specified on the face of this Note (each, a ""). This Note may be redeemed on any Redemption Date in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed (except if this Note is Original Issue Discount, as described below), together with interest on this Note payable to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, on notice given by the Company to the EdNotes Trustee at least ten (10) days prior to the proposed Redemption Date and to the Holder of this Note at least five (5) days prior to the proposed Redemption Date.
Redemption Date
If no repayment right by Survivor's Option is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note may not be repaid at the option of the Holder prior to the Maturity Date. If a repayment right by Survivor's Option is set forth on the face of this Note, this Note will be repayable in whole or in part on the terms set forth in the Survivor's Option Rider attached to this Note.
In the event of redemption or repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor in the aggregate principal amount to and in exchange for the portion of this Note that is not redeemed or repaid will be issued in the name of the Holder of this Note upon its cancellation.
 
As described on the face of this Note, the entire principal amount of this Note (except if this Note is Original Issue Discount, as described below) will be due and payable on the Maturity Date, which amount includes accrued amortization of original issue discount, if any. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the EdNotes Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all of the outstanding Notes, by notice to the Company and the EdNotes Trustee, may declare the principal of all the Notes due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
If this Note is specified on the face of this Note to be Original Issue Discount, the amount of principal payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment upon exercise of Survivor's Option or acceleration of maturity will be such portion of the principal amount as may be specified, or determined as specified, in the terms of the Notes and in the Pricing Supplement, with the amount of interest payable equal to any unpaid interest accrued on this Note to, but not including, the Redemption Date, date of repurchase upon exercise of Survivor's Option or date of acceleration of maturity, as applicable.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as provided in the Indenture, the amendment of the Indenture and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes at any time by the Company and the EdNotes Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note will be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer of, exchange for or substitution of this Note, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have given, made or taken any action under the Indenture, the principal amount of any Note that is Original Issue Discount which is deemed to be outstanding will be the amount of the principal of such Note which would be due and payable if the maturity date of such Note had been accelerated to such date.
Holders of Notes may not enforce their rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference in this Note to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or the Indenture will alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, prescribed in this Note.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, and this Note duly executed by, the Holder of this Note or by his attorney duly authorized in writing and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denomination as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to the due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the EdNotes Trustee and any agent of the Company or the EdNotes Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner of this Note for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the EdNotes Trustee nor any such agent will be affected by notice to the contrary.

The death of a person owning this Note by tenancy in common will be deemed the death of a holder of this Note only with respect to the deceased holder's interest in this Note so held by tenancy in common; except that in the event this Note is held by a husband and wife as tenants in common, the death of either will be deemed the death of the holder of this Note, and the entire principal amount of this Note will be subject to repayment. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of this Note will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner thereof for the purpose of this provision, regardless of the registered holder, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the EdNotes Trustee and the Company. Such beneficial ownership will be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife and trust arrangements where one person has substantially all of the beneficial ownership interest in this Note during his or her lifetime.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.
