Sale and Delivery to the Underwriters; Delivery Date.
        (a)   On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Company, the principal amount of Senior Notes set forth in
Schedule I
to this Agreement opposite the name of such Underwriter (plus any additional amount of Senior Notes that such Underwriter may become obligated to purchase pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement), at a purchase price equal to 96.85% of the principal amount thereof.
        (b)   In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, the option to request to purchase up to an additional $41,250,000 aggregate original principal amount of the Option Senior Notes, to cover over-allotments in respect of the Senior Notes, at a purchase price equal to 96.85% of the principal amount thereof. The option hereby granted will expire thirty (30) calendar days after the Initial Delivery Date (as defined hereafter) (the "
Option Expiry Time
") and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time upon written notice by the Underwriters to the Company setting forth the number of Option Senior Notes as to which the Underwriters are then requesting the exercise of the option and a proposed time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Senior Notes. The Company may in its sole discretion consent or not consent to the Underwriters' request to exercise the option and must notify the Underwriters promptly of its decision. The time and date of payment and delivery for the Option Senior Notes (the "
Subsequent Delivery Date
" and the Initial Delivery Date and the Subsequent Delivery Date, each a "
Delivery Date
") shall be determined by the Company, but shall not be later than fifteen (15) business days after the Underwriters' request to exercise of the option, nor in any event prior to the Initial Delivery Date, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company. If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the Option Senior Notes, and agreed by the Company, each of the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, will purchase that proportion of the original principal amount of the Option Senior Notes then being purchased which the original principal amount of the Initial Senior Notes set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I bears to the total principal amount of the Initial Senior Notes.
        (c)   Payment of the purchase price and delivery of the Initial Senior Notes shall be made at the offices of the Company at 11600 Sallie Mae Drive, Reston, Virginia 20193 at or before 1:00 P.M., New York time, on December 15, 2003 (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement) or such other time, place or date as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company (such time and date of payment and delivery, the "
Initial Delivery Date
").
        (d)   In addition, in the event that the Underwriters have exercised their option to purchase all or any of the Option Senior Notes, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of such Option Senior Notes shall be made at the above-mentioned offices, or at such other place as shall be
agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company, on the Subsequent Delivery Date as specified in the notice from the Company to the Underwriters.
        (e)   Payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer in federal funds at the Initial Delivery Date or Subsequent Delivery Date, as applicable, against delivery to the Underwriters of the Senior Notes. It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representatives, for each Underwriter's account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the principal amount of the Senior Notes which each Underwriter has agreed to purchase. Each Representative, individually and not as a representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be purchased by any Underwriter whose payment has not been received by the Initial Delivery Date or Subsequent Delivery Date, as applicable, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations under this Agreement.
        (f)    The delivery of the Senior Notes shall be made in fully registered form, registered in the name of Cede & Co., to the offices of The Depository Trust Company in New York, New York or its designee, and the Underwriters shall accept such delivery.

provided further,
the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this Section 6(a) with respect to the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results solely from the fact that such Underwriter sold Senior Notes to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference), whichever is most recent, if the Company has previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter.

(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
        (c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Sections 6(a) or (b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. The consent in this last sentence shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and the indemnifying party agrees that the indemnified party shall in all cases be justified in withholding consent unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
        (d)   If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 6(a) or (b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter, on the other, from the offering of the Senior Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 6(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand,
and each Underwriter, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Senior Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Underwriter with respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand or by any Underwriter, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. With respect to any Underwriter, such relative fault shall also be determined by reference to the extent (if any) to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) with respect to any preliminary prospectus result solely from the fact that such Underwriter sold Senior Notes to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) if the Company has previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter. The Company and each Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Senior Notes purchased by or through such Underwriter were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Underwriters under this Section 6(d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
        (e)   The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and each Underwriter's obligations under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
        7.     
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Senior Notes.
        8.     
Default by an Underwriter.
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Senior Notes, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Senior Notes on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Senior Notes, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Senior Notes on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Senior Notes, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Senior Notes, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Delivery Date for such Senior Notes for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
        (b)   If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Senior Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 8(a), the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, to be purchased at the Delivery Date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Senior Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase, and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Senior Notes which such Underwriter agreed to purchase) of the Senior Notes of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
        (c)   If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Senior Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 8(a), the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, to be purchased at the Delivery Date as referred to in Section 8(b), or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 8(b) to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Senior Notes of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 4 of this Agreement and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 6 of this Agreement; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
        9.     
Effect of Termination.
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Senior Notes except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 of this Agreement; but, if for any other reason Senior Notes are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the
Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Senior Notes, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Senior Notes except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 of this Agreement.
        10.   
Miscellaneous.
        (a)   
Amendments; Supplements.
This Agreement may be amended or supplemented if, but only if, such amendment or supplement is in writing and is signed by the Company and each Representative.
        (b)   
Notices.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address or facsimile transmission number of the Representatives as set forth in Schedule V to this Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to SLM Corporation, 11600 Sallie Mae Drive, Reston, Virginia 20193, Attention: Vice President, Finance, facsimile transmission number (703) 810-7655, with a copy to the Company, Attention: Marianne M.

        (c)   
Successors and Assigns.
This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, each Underwriter and the Company, and to the extent provided in Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls any Underwriter or the Company, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of a Senior Note through or from any Underwriter hereunder shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
        (d)   
Time of the Essence.
Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
        (e)   
Choice of Law.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
        (f)    
Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
