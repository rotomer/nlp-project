     (d) the Notes have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, will have been executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in the manner provided for in the Indenture against payment therefor, and will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles and the discretion of courts in granting equitable remedies; the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles and the discretion of courts in granting equitable remedies; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and the Indenture conforms and the Notes of any particular issuance of Notes will conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented that relate to such issuance of Notes;
     (e) other than as set forth in the Prospectus, the Company and each of its subsidiaries have conducted their businesses and are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, except for any noncompliance which would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole;
     (f) the issue and sale of the Notes, the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, (ii) any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, the non-compliance with which, either singly or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (B) the Company's ability to enter into this Agreement and to issue the Notes, or (iii) any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, the non-compliance with which, either singly or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (B) the Company's ability to enter into this Agreement and to issue the Notes; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes, the issue and sale of the Notes or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Terms Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Commencement Date, obtained under the Securities Act or the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue

     (g) other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, which are of a character that are required to be disclosed in the Prospectus which have not been properly disclosed therein;

Each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes and each issuance of Notes shall be deemed an affirmation by the Company that the foregoing representations and warranties are true and correct at the time, as the case may be, of such acceptance or of such issuance, in each case as though expressly made at such time. The representations, warranties and covenants of the Company shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes.
     Unless the Company has suspended the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes pursuant to paragraph (a) of Article IV, each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by means of a pricing supplement or a prospectus supplement that does not relate to the Notes) by the filing of a post-effective amendment with the Commission, or the filing by the Company of a Form 10-K or Form 10-Q pursuant to Section 13
 
of the Exchange Act, or, if so agreed in connection with a particular transaction, the Company shall furnish the Agents with (1) a written opinion, dated the date of such amendment, filing or as otherwise agreed, of the Company's general counsel, in substantially the form previously delivered under Section II(b), but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such date; (2) a letter, dated the date of such amendment, filing or as otherwise agreed, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent auditors, in substantially the form previously delivered under Section II(c), but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such date; and (3) a certificate, dated the date of such amendment, filing or as otherwise agreed and signed by an executive officer of the Company, in substantially the form previously delivered under Section II(a), but modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such date.
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless you, each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) you and each of your and such controlling person's officers and directors against any and all losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) to which any of them may become subject (including all reasonable legal and other costs of investigating, disputing or defending any such claim or action), insofar as such losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading , that the Company shall not be liable for any such loss, liability, cost, action or claim arising from any statements or omissions made in reliance on and in conformity with written information provided by you through the Purchasing Agent to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
provided
however,
     (b) Each Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, and the Company's and such controlling person's officers and directors from and against any and all losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) to which any of them may become subject (including all reasonable legal and other costs of investigating, disputing or defending any such claim or action), insofar as such losses, liabilities, costs or claims (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein.
     (c) If any claim, demand, action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or alleged against an indemnified party in respect of which indemnity is to be sought against an indemnifying party pursuant to the preceding paragraphs,
 
the indemnified party shall, promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any such claim, demand, action or proceeding, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such claim, demand, action or proceeding, enclosing a copy of all papers served, if any; , , the omission to so notify such indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provisions of this Section VI unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section VI for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of such proceeding and has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interests between them. It is agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate law firm (in addition to local counsel where reasonably necessary) for all such indemnified parties. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
provided
that
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section VI is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under the preceding paragraphs of this Section VI in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law,
 
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) of Section VI were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d) of Section VI. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) of Section VI shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d) of Section VI, no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total public offering price at which the Notes purchased by it in the offering giving rise to the damages were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) of Section VI to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
     (e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section VI and the representations and warranties of the Company and you in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any termination of this Agreement; (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents; (iii) any investigation by an indemnified party or on such party's behalf or any person controlling an indemnified party or by or on behalf of the indemnifying party, its directors or officers or any person controlling the indemnifying party; and (iv) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
     This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the Agents, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, upon the giving of five (5) business days written notice of such termination to the other party. In the event of any such termination, neither party shall have any liability to the other party hereto, except for obligations hereunder which expressly survive the
 
termination of this Agreement and except that, if at the time of termination an offer for the purchase of Notes shall have been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto shall not yet have occurred, the Company shall have the obligations provided herein with respect to such Note or Notes.
     Subsequent to the execution of a Terms Agreement, (i) the Purchasing Agent may terminate such Terms Agreement, and (ii), if the Purchasing Agent does not elect to terminate such Terms Agreement pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, upon the request of an Agent with respect to Notes to be purchased through the Purchasing Agent by such Agent, the Purchasing Agent shall terminate such Terms Agreement to the extent of the Notes that were to be purchased through the Purchasing Agent by such requesting Agent, in each case immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if there shall have occurred:
     (A) since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Supplement relating to the Notes to be delivered at the relevant Settlement Date, any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement to the Prospectus filed after the execution of a Terms Agreement and at or prior to the related Settlement Date), the effect of which is, in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasing Agent or such requesting Agent, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering of such Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of such Notes; or
     (B) any downgrading in the rating of the Company's debt securities (including the Notes) by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of such debt securities; , however that the Purchasing Agent and the Agents shall not have right to terminate a Terms Agreement if the Company shall have given the Agents notice of such downgrade or review prior to the execution of that Terms Agreement; or
provided
     (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared in the United States by Federal authorities, a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or the authorities of any country in whose currency any Notes are denominated under the applicable Terms Agreement, or a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the District of Columbia declared by either Federal or District of Columbia authorities; or
     (D) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, if, in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent or such requesting Agent, the effect of any such outbreak, escalation or
 
declaration makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering of such Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of such Notes; or
     (E) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange has been suspended or materially limited, by said exchange or by order of the Commission, or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States.
     If this Agreement is terminated, the last sentence of the second paragraph of Section IV(a), Sections III(c), (d) and (e), Section VI, and the first paragraph of Section XII shall survive; , , if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of Section III(a) and (b), and Section IV(b) and (d) shall also survive until time of delivery.
provided

     This Agreement shall be binding upon you and the Company, and inure solely to the benefit of you and the Company and any other person expressly entitled to indemnification hereunder and the respective personal representatives, successors and assigns of each, and no other person shall acquire or have any rights under or by virtue of this Agreement.
     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding against it arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered against it in connection with this Agreement may be brought in any Federal or New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, such party hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the jurisdiction of each of the aforesaid courts in personam, generally and unconditionally with respect to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, assets and revenues. Each party hereby also irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
 
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
     If this Agreement is executed by or on behalf of any party, such person hereby states that at the time of the execution of this Agreement he has no notice of revocation of the power of attorney by which he has executed this Agreement as such attorney.
     The Company will pay the expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement; (ii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and auditors, of the Trustee and of any paying agents appointed by the Company; (iii) the printing and delivery to you in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (iv) if the Company lists Notes on a securities exchange, the costs and fees of such listing; and (v) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes.
     This Agreement may be executed by each of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, and by each of the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
     As used herein, "business day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to be closed in the City of New York.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof, and upon acceptance hereof by you, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and you.

Indemnification
Losses
 
such Losses arise out of or are in connection with the breach of any representation, warranty or agreement made by you herein.

Such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
          The indemnity agreements contained in this Section and the representations and warranties by you in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any termination of this Agreement; (ii) any investigation made by an indemnified party or on such party's behalf or any person controlling an indemnified party or by or on behalf of the indemnifying party, its directors or officers or any person controlling the indemnifying party; and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any Securities.
          5. . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and supercedes all prior oral or written agreements between the parties hereto or their predecessors with regard to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be terminated by Written Communication from you to AAFS or from AAFS to you. Until so terminated, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may be supplemented or amended by us by written notice thereof to you, and any such supplement or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective with respect to any Offering to which this Agreement applies after the date you received such supplement or amendment. Each reference to "this Agreement" herein shall, as appropriate, be

          6. . This Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and other persons specified in Section 1 hereof, and the respective successors and assigns of each of them.
Successors and Assigns
          7. . This Agreement and the terms and conditions set forth herein with respect to any Offering together with such supplementary terms and conditions with respect to such Offering as may be contained in any Written Communication from us to you in connection therewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of an EdNote, shall be deemed the death of the beneficial owner thereof for purposes of this provision, regardless of the registered holder, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the EdNotes Trustee and the Company. Such beneficial interest shall be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife and trust arrangements where one person has substantially all of the beneficial ownership interest in the EdNote during his or her lifetime.
