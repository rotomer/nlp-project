     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
 
delayed), be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. The consent in this last sentence shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and the indemnifying party agrees that the indemnified party shall in all cases be justified in withholding consent unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
 
respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Shares and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     8. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Shares for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro
 
rata share (based on the number of Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
     10. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Shares with respect to which the Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 5 and 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Shares, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 5 and 7 hereof.
     11. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth herein, with a copy to Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, One World Financial Center, New York, New York, 10281, facsimile transmission number (212) 504-6666, Attention: Louis J. Bevilacqua, Esq.; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to SLM Corporation, 12061 Bluemont Way, Reston, Virginia 20190, facsimile transmission number (703) 984-6500 (fax), Attention: Eric Watson; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to
 
Section 7(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     12. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     13. Time shall be of the essence. As used herein, the term "Business Day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     14. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
     15. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us seven counterparts hereof.
Very truly yours,
SLM Corporation

Annex I
     Form of Opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, Special Counsel to the Underwriters:
     1. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
     2. The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     3. The Company has the authorized capital stock set forth in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. The issued and outstanding securities have been duly authorized and are validly issued.
     4. The Securities have been duly authorized for issuance and sale to the Underwriters pursuant to the Agreement and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Agreement, and paid for in accordance with the Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable.
     5. The Securities conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus, under the caption "Description of the Series B Preferred Stock" insofar as such descriptions purport to summarize certain provisions of documents specifically referred to therein.
     6. The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of certain provisions of the Agreement constitute a fair summary of such terms in all material respects.
     7. The statements in the Prospectus under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Tax Considerations," to the extent such statements summarize material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of the Securities to the holders thereof described therein, are correct in all material respects.
     8. The Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement (in each case, with the exception of any information incorporated by reference therein and any numerical, financial, statistical and quantitative data included therein, as to which we express no view), appeared on their respective faces to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such documents as of the relevant date.
     We are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Prospectus and have not made any independent check or verification thereof (other than as set forth in paragraphs 5-7 of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith (the "
Opinion
 
")). However, in connection with our representation of the Underwriters we participated in conferences with representatives of the Company and your representatives, at which the contents of the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. We hereby advise you that, in the course of the representation referred to above and our examination of the documents referred to in the Opinion Letter, considered in light of our understanding of applicable law and the experience we have gained through our practice, no facts came to our attention that cause us to believe that , as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, the Registration Statement contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the date hereof, the Prospectus contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that we express no view as to the adequacy or accuracy of the financial, numerical, statistical or quantitative information included in or omitted from the Prospectus.
Letter
 
Annex II(a)
     Form of Opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, Special Counsel to the Company:
     (i) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
     (ii) The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and, when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
     (iii) The statements in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Underwriting," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;
     (iv) The statements in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Description of the Series B Preferred Stock," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects; and
     (v) The Company is not and, solely after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus Supplement, will not be an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     (vi) Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that under current United States federal tax law, although the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Tax Considerations" does not purport to summarize all possible United States federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Securities, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Securities.
     In addition to the matters set forth above, such opinion shall also include a statement to the effect that, based on the procedures set forth in said opinion: (i) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the filing of the Company's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K and as of June  , 2005 and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement) and (ii) no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to
 
believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date of the filing of such Form 10-K and as of June  , 2005, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement).
 
Annex II(b)
     Form of Opinion of Robert S. Lavet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company:
     (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, with corporate power to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
     (ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; and the Shares conform to the description of the Shares contained in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
     (iii) To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
     (iv) The issue and sale of the Shares being delivered at the Time of Delivery and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the Shares and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its properties;
     (v) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Shares being delivered at the Time of Delivery or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be
 
required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriters;
     (vi) Neither the Company nor any of its material subsidiaries is in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound; and
     (vii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other financial information therein, as to which I express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and they have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading.
