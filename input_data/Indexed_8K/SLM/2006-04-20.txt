Exhibit 99.1
RESTON, Va., April 20, 2006
SLM Corporation (NYSE: SLM), commonly known as Sallie Mae, today reported first-quarter 2006 earnings and performance results that include a 14-percent increase in the managed student loan portfolio to $126.9 billion from the year-ago quarter's $111.7 billion. Also during the quarter, the company originated $3.6 billion through its internal lending brands, a 51-percent increase over the year-ago period.
        "We are pleased with our portfolio growth and the strong performance of our lending brands. Our pipeline of new school wins is impressive," said Tim Fitzpatrick, chief executive officer. "This quarter's results put us on the right path to deliver on our 2006 projections."
        During the first-quarter 2006, the company originated $7.6 billion in preferred-channel loans, of which $2.2 billion were private education loans. Preferred-channel loan originations include loans originated by the company's internal lending brands and external lending partners.
        Sallie Mae reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also presents certain non-GAAP or "core earnings" performance measures. The company's management, equity investors, credit rating agencies and debt capital providers use these "core earnings" measures to monitor the company's business performance.
        Sallie Mae reported first-quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $152 million, or $.34 per diluted share, compared to $223 million, or $.49 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Included in these GAAP results are pre-tax losses on derivative and hedging activities of $(87) million, compared to $(34) million in the year-ago quarter, and a decrease of $(44) million in servicing and securitization revenue.
        "Core earnings" net income for the quarter was $287 million, or $.65 per diluted share, up from $256 million, or $.57 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. During the first-quarter 2006, the company began expensing stock-based compensation. Recognizing stock-based compensation expense in both the current and year-ago periods, "core earnings" per diluted share were $.63 in the 2006 first quarter after eliminating the $.02 impact of a revision to borrower benefit estimates, up from $.55 in the same quarter in 2005, a 15-percent increase.
        "Core earnings" net interest income was $596 million for the quarter, a 21-percent increase over the year-ago quarter's $494 million. "Core earnings" other income, which consists primarily of fees earned from guarantor servicing and collection activity, was $245 million for the 2006 first quarter, up from $221 million in the year-ago quarter. "Core earnings" operating expenses were $309 million, compared to $249 million in the same quarter last year.

        Total equity for the company at March 31, 2006, was $3.8 billion, up from $3.1 billion a year ago. The company's tangible capital at March 31, 2006, was 1.86 percent of managed assets, compared to 1.63 percent at the same time last year.

In December 2004, the Company adopted the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 04-8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share," as it relates to the Company's $2 billion in contingently convertible debt instruments ("Co-Cos") issued in May 2003. EITF No. 04-8 requires the shares underlying Co-Cos to be included in diluted earnings per common share computations regardless of whether the market price trigger or the conversion price has been met, using the "if-converted" method. The impact of Co-Cos due to the application of EITF No. 04-8 was to decrease diluted earnings per common share by the following amounts:

Non-GAAP "Core Earnings"
        In accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In addition to evaluating the Company's GAAP-based financial information, management evaluates the Company's business segments under certain non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as "core earnings" for each business segment, and we refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies and lenders. While "core earnings" are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, we rely on "core earnings" to manage each operating segment because we believe these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management.
        Our "core earnings" are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a "core earnings" basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision maker. Our "core earnings" are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Company's core business activities. Our "core earnings" are not
defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. "Core earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP as described below. Accordingly, the Company's "core earnings" presentation does not represent another comprehensive basis of accounting. A more detailed discussion of the differences between GAAP and "core earnings" follows.
Limitations of "Core Earnings"
        While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, management believes that "core earnings" are an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations. Nevertheless, "core earnings" are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, as stated above, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our "core earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Unlike GAAP, "core earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP. Accordingly, the Company's "core earnings" presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not compare our Company's performance with that of other financial services companies based upon "core earnings." "Core earnings" results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, the Company's board of directors, rating agencies and lenders to assess performance.
        Other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive "core earnings" results. For example, in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for "hedge treatment," as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges, we focus on the long-term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price on the fair value of such instruments during the period. Under GAAP, the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments (but not on the underlying hedged item) tend to show more volatility in the short term. While our presentation of our results on a Managed Basis provides important information regarding the performance of our Managed portfolio, a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold to a trust managed by us. While we believe that our Managed Basis presentation presents the economic substance of our Managed loan portfolio, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains. Our "core earnings" results exclude certain Floor Income, which is real cash income, from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods. Management's financial planning and valuation of operating results, however, does not take into account Floor Income because of its inherent uncertainty, except when it is economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts.
Pre-Tax Differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP
        Our "core earnings" are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a "core earnings" basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision maker. Our "core earnings" are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Company's core business activities. "Core earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP, as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between GAAP and "core earnings" that follows, which includes further detail on each specific adjustments required to reconcile our "core earnings" segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.
1)
Securitization Accounting
: Under GAAP, certain securitization transactions in our Lending operating segment are accounted for as sales of assets. Under "core earnings" for the Lending operating segment, we present all securitization transactions on a Managed Basis as long-term non-recourse financings. The upfront "gains" on sale from securitization transactions as well as ongoing "servicing and securitization revenue" presented in accordance with GAAP are excluded from "core earnings" and are replaced by the interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitization loans. We also exclude transactions with our off-balance sheet trusts from "core earnings" as they are considered intercompany transactions on a Managed Basis.
2)
Derivative Accounting:
"Core earnings" exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses arising primarily in our Lending business segment, and to a lesser degree in our Corporate and Other business segment, that are caused primarily by the one-sided mark-to-market derivative valuations prescribed by SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for "hedge treatment" under GAAP. Under "core earnings," we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged item's life. "Core earnings" also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts that under SFAS No. 133 are required to be accounted for as derivatives and marked-to-market through earnings.
3)
Floor Income:
The timing and amount (if any) of Floor Income earned in our Lending operating segment is uncertain and in excess of expected spreads. Therefore, we exclude such income from "core earnings" when it is not economically hedged. We employ derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and futures, to economically hedge Floor Income. As discussed above in "Derivative Accounting," these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges, and therefore, under GAAP, they are marked-to-market through the "gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net" line on the income statement with no offsetting gain or loss recorded for the economically hedged items. For "core earnings," we reverse the fair value adjustments on the Floor Income Contracts and futures economically hedging Floor Income and include the amortization of net premiums received (net of Eurodollar futures contracts' realized gains or losses) in income.
4)
Other items:
We exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. For the three months ended March 31, 2006, reported net income attributable to common stock included $11 million related to employee stock option compensation expense, net of related tax effects. The following table is a pro-forma presentation of our results had SFAS No. 123(R) been in effect for all periods presented.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Consolidated Earnings Summary
Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2005
        For the three months ended March 31, 2006, net income was $152 million ($.34 diluted earnings per common share), a 65 percent decrease from the $431 million in net income for the three months ended December 31, 2005. On a pre-tax basis, first quarter of 2006 net income of $290 million was a 55 percent decrease from the $648 million in net income earned in the fourth quarter of 2005. The larger percentage decrease in quarter-over-quarter, after-tax net income versus pre-tax net income is driven by the increase in the effective tax rate from 33 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 to 47 percent in the first quarter of 2006, which is caused by the permanent impact of excluding non-taxable gains and losses on equity forward contracts in the Company's stock from taxable income. Under the SFAS No. 150, we are required to mark the equity forward contracts to market each quarter and recognize the change in their value in income. Conversely, these unrealized gains and losses are not recognized on a tax basis. In the first quarter of 2006, the unrealized loss on our outstanding equity forward contracts was $122 million, a decrease of $178 million versus the unrealized gain of $56 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005.
        When comparing the pre-tax results of the first quarter to the fourth quarter, there were several factors contributing to the decrease, the two largest of which were a $157 million decrease in the net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities, and a decrease in securitization gains of $211 million. The net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities primarily relate to the unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on our derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment, with the greatest impact in the first quarter coming from an unrealized loss of $122 million on our equity forward contracts. The decline in the value of the equity forward contracts is caused by the quarter-over-quarter decline in the stock price of SLM Corporation that resulted in the $178 million decrease in value discussed above. This decrease was partially offset by unrealized gains on our Floor Income Contracts due to higher interest rates.
        The decrease in securitization gains can primarily be attributed to a Private Education Loan securitization in the fourth quarter of 2005, which had a pre-tax gain of $222 million or 15 percent of
the amount securitized, versus no such gains in the first quarter of 2006. The 2006 gains of $30 million or .4 percent of the amount securitized were the result of two FFELP Stafford securitizations and one Consolidation Loan securitization. Private Education Loan securitizations generally have significantly higher gains as a percentage of assets securitized due to the higher earning spreads on those loans. Also in the first quarter, we recorded impairment losses in servicing and securitization income to our Retained Interests in securitizations of $52 million versus $65 million in the fourth quarter. These impairments were primarily the result of continued high consolidation loan activity and an impairment of the Embedded Floor Income included in the Retained Interest due to higher interest rates. The reduction in impairment losses was the major factor in the $19 million increase in servicing and securitization revenue.
        Net interest income was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter as off-balance sheet securitizations along with principal paydowns approximately equaled the acquisition of new loans, leaving the average balance of on-balance sheet student loans relatively unchanged.
        During the first quarter we acquired $8.6 billion in student loans, including $2.0 billion in Private Education Loans. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we acquired $6.5 billion in student loans, of which $1.5 billion were Private Education Loans. In the first quarter of 2006, we originated $7.6 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel compared to $4.6 billion originated in the fourth quarter of 2005. Within our Preferred Channel $3.6 billion or 51 percent were originated under Sallie Mae owned brands.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2005
        For the three months ended March 31, 2006, net income of $152 million ($.34 diluted earnings per share) was a 32 percent decrease from net income of $223 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005. On a pre-tax basis, first quarter of 2006 income of $290 million was a 30 percent decrease from $412 million earned in the first quarter of 2005. The larger percentage decrease in year-over-year, after-tax net income versus pre-tax net income is driven by the increase in the effective tax rate from 45 percent in the first quarter of 2005 to 47 percent in the first quarter of 2006, which is caused by fluctuations in the unrealized gains and losses on equity forward as described above. In the first quarter of 2006, the unrealized loss on our outstanding equity forward contracts was $122 million versus an unrealized loss of $108 million in the first quarter of 2005, both of which were caused by a decrease in the Company's stock price.
        There were several factors that contributed to the decline in the pre-tax results of the first quarter of 2006 versus the year-ago quarter, the two largest of which were a $53 million decrease in the net gain on derivative and hedging activities, and a decrease in securitization gains of $20 million. The decrease in net gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities primarily relates to a smaller unrealized gain on Floor Income Contracts and to the increase in the unrealized loss on equity forward contracts discussed above. Forward interest rates rose in both quarters, but the unrealized gain on the Floor Income Contracts was smaller in the first quarter of 2006 because the market interest rate was above the strike rate on a number of Floor Income Contracts resulting in a portion of the Floor Income Contracts having little or no value at the beginning of the period; the further rise in interest rates had no effect on their value.
        As discussed above, securitization gains in the first quarter of 2006 were $30 million on three off-balance sheet transactions versus the first quarter of 2005 where there were two off-balance sheet transactions which resulted in securitization gains of $50 million. There were no Private Education Loan securitizations in either quarter. We incurred impairment losses in the first quarter of 2006 to our Retained Interests in securitizations of $52 million versus $9 million in the year-ago quarter. The 2006 losses were primarily the result of the combined high level of Consolidation Loan activity and the impairment of Embedded Floor Income as a result of interest rates. The increase in year-over-year
impairment losses was the major driver of the $44 million decrease in servicing and securitization revenue.
        Net interest income increased by $40 million or 12 percent year-over-year. The increase was due to the 19 percent increase in average interest earning assets, offset by a 19 basis point decrease in the on-balance sheet student loan spread. The decrease in on-balance sheet student loan spread is primarily due to higher interest rates, which reduced Floor Income. In the first quarter of 2006, fee and other income and collections revenue totaled $244 million, an increase of 13 percent over the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the $21 million or 60 percent increase in collections revenue.
        Our Managed student loan portfolio grew by $15.2 billion, from $111.7 billion at March 31, 2005 to $126.9 billion at March 31, 2006. This growth was fueled by the acquisition of $8.6 billion of student loans, including $2.0 billion in Private Education Loans, in the quarter ended March 31, 2006, a 13 percent increase over the $7.5 billion acquired in the year-ago quarter, of which $1.4 billion were Private Education Loans. In the quarter ended March 31, 2006, we originated $7.6 billion of student loans through our Preferred Channel, an increase of 12 percent over the $6.8 billion originated in the year-ago quarter.
NET INTEREST INCOME
Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Income
        The amounts in the following table are adjusted for the impact of certain tax-exempt and tax-advantaged investments based on the marginal federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent.
Average Balance Sheets
        The following table reflects the rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
        The decrease in the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2006 versus year-ago quarter is primarily due to fluctuations in the student loan spread as discussed under "Student Loans
Student Loan Spread Analysis
."
Student Loans
        For both federally insured and Private Education Loans, we account for premiums paid, discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination and acquisition of student loans in accordance with SFAS No. 91, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases." The unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts, as well as interest rate reductions and rebates expected to be earned through borrower benefit programs. Discounts on Private Education Loans are deferred and accreted to income over the lives of the student loans. In the table below, this accretion of discounts is netted with the amortization of the premiums.
Student Loan Spread Analysis
        The following table analyzes the reported earnings from student loans both on-balance sheet and those off-balance sheet in securitization trusts. For student loans off-balance sheet, we will continue to
earn securitization and servicing fee revenues over the life of the securitized loan portfolios. The off-balance sheet information is discussed in more detail in "SECURITIZATION PROGRAMServicing and Securitization Revenue" where we analyze the on-going servicing revenue and Residual Interest earned on the securitized portfolios of student loans. For an analysis of our student loan spread for the entire portfolio of Managed student loans on a similar basis to the on-balance sheet analysis, see "LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENTStudent Loan Spread AnalysisManaged Basis."
Discussion of Student Loan SpreadEffects of Floor Income and Derivative Accounting
        One of the primary drivers of fluctuations in our on-balance sheet student loan spread is the level of gross Floor Income (Floor Income earned before payments on Floor Income Contracts) earned in the period. For the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005, we earned gross Floor Income of $14 million (7 basis points), $26 million (12 basis points) and $66 million (40 basis points), respectively. The reduction in gross Floor Income is primarily due to the increase in short-term interest rates. We believe that we have economically hedged most of the Floor Income through the sale of Floor Income Contracts, under which we receive an upfront fee and agree to pay the counterparty the Floor Income earned on a notional amount of student loans. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and as a result the payments on the Floor Income Contracts are included on the income statement with "gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net" rather than in student loan interest income. Payments on Floor Income Contracts associated with on-balance sheet student loans for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005 totaled $14 million (7 basis points), $26 million (12 basis points) and $60 million (36 basis points), respectively.
        In addition to Floor Income Contracts, we also extensively use basis swaps to manage our basis risk associated with interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. These swaps generally do not qualify as
accounting hedges and are likewise required to be accounted for in the "gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net" line on the income statement. As a result, they are not considered in the calculation of the cost of funds in the above table.
Discussion of Student Loan SpreadEffects of Significant Events in the Quarters Presented
        In the first quarter of 2006, we updated our assumptions for the qualification for Borrower Benefits to reflect trends in borrower behavior versus qualification requirements. These updates resulted in a reduction of our liability for Borrower Benefits of $10 million or 5 basis points.
        In the fourth quarter of 2005, we continued to process Consolidation Loan applications from the record volume in the second quarter of 2005. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, a significant volume of our Consolidation Loans were consolidated with third party lenders through the Direct Lending program (see "LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENTConsolidation Loan Activity" for further discussion). Both of these factors resulted in an increase in student loan premium write-offs for both FFELP Stafford and Consolidation Loans consolidated with third parties in the fourth quarter. Loans lost through consolidation benefit the student spread to a lesser extent through the write-off of borrower benefit reserves associated with these loans.
Discussion of Student Loan SpreadOther Quarter-over-Quarter Fluctuations
        After giving effect to the items discussed above, the increase in the first quarter of 2006 on-balance sheet spread as compared to the fourth and first quarter of 2005 was due primarily to the increase in the average balance of higher yielding Private Education Loans, partially offset by the higher average balance of Consolidation Loans. The average balance of on-balance sheet Private Education Loans in the first quarter of 2006 increased 15 percent and 44 percent over the average balances in the fourth and first quarter of 2005, respectively.
On-Balance Sheet Floor Income
        For on-balance sheet student loans, gross Floor Income is included in student loan income whereas payments on Floor Income Contracts are included in the "gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net" line in other income. The following table summarizes the components of Floor Income from on-balance sheet student loans, net of payments under Floor Income Contracts, for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
        The decrease in the first quarter 2006 net Floor Income versus the prior and year-ago quarters is primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates.
SECURITIZATION PROGRAM
Securitization Activity
        The following table summarizes our securitization activity for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
(1)
In certain Consolidation Loan securitization structures, we hold certain rights that can affect the remarketing of certain bonds, such that these securitizations did not qualify as qualifying special purpose entities ("QSPEs"). Accordingly, they are accounted for on-balance sheet as variable interest entities ("VIEs").
        The decrease in the FFELP Stafford/PLUS gain as a percentage of loans securitized over last year from 1.4 percent for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005 to 0.3 percent for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006 is primarily due to: 1) an increase in the CPR assumption to account for continued high levels of consolidation loan activity; 2) an increase in the discount rate to reflect higher long term rates; 3) the re-introduction of Risk Sharing with the legislation reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act; (see RECENT DEVELOPMENTSReauthorization) and 4) an increase in the amount of student loan premiums included in the carrying value of the loans sold. The higher premiums on these loans was primarily due to the allocation of the purchase price to student loans acquired through acquisition and to loans acquired through zero-fee lending and the school-as-lender channel.
Servicing and Securitization Revenue
        Servicing and securitization revenue, the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools accounted for off-balance sheet as QSPEs, includes the interest earned on the Residual Interest and the revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts. Interest income recognized on the Residual Interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by estimating future cash flows each quarter.
        The following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
        Servicing and securitization revenue is primarily driven by the average balance of off-balance sheet student loans and the amount of and the difference in the timing of Embedded Floor Income recognition on off-balance sheet student loans. Servicing and securitization revenue can also be negatively impacted by impairments of the value of our Retained Interest, caused primarily by the effect of higher than expected Consolidation Loan activity on FFELP Stafford/PLUS student loan securitizations and the effect of market interest rates on the Embedded Floor Income included in the Retained Interest. The majority of the consolidations bring the loans back on-balance sheet so for those loans we retain the value of the asset on-balance sheet versus in the trust. For the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2005, we recorded impairments to the Retained Interests of $52 million, $65 million and $9 million, respectively. The impairment charge for the first quarter of 2006 was primarily a result of the continued consolidation activity ($24 million of impairment) as well as impairment related to our Embedded Floor Income ($28 million of impairment), due to the increase in interest rates during the first quarter of 2006. The impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 was primarily caused by the effect of record levels of consolidation activity ($42 million of impairment) and by the effect of the one percent Risk Sharing loss applied to student loans receiving the EP designation ($23 million of impairment) that was imposed by legislation reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act (see RECENT DEVELOPMENTSReauthorization). The level and timing of Consolidation Loan activity is highly volatile, and in response we continue to revise our estimates of the effects of Consolidation Loan activity on our Retained Interests and it may result in additional impairment recorded in future periods if Consolidation Loan activity remains higher than projected.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
        The results of operations of the Company's Lending and DMO operating segments are presented below. These defined business segments operate in distinct business environments and are considered reportable segments under SFAS No. 131 based on quantitative thresholds applied to the Company's financial statements. In addition, we provide other complementary products and services, including guarantor and student loan servicing, through smaller operating segments that do not meet such thresholds and are aggregated in the Corporate and Other reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.
        The management reporting process measures the performance of the Company's operating segments based on the management structure of the Company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Management, including the Company's chief operating decision maker, evaluates the performance of the Company's operating segments based on their profitability as measured by "core earnings." Accordingly, information regarding the Company's reportable segments is provided herein based on "core earnings," which are discussed in detail below. Our "core earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. "Core earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP as described below. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting and as a result, our management reporting is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. The Company's operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Intersegment revenues and expenses are netted within the appropriate financial statement line items consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management. Changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information.
        "Core earnings" are the primary financial performance measures used by management to develop the Company's financial plans, track results, and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation. While "core earnings" are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, the Company relies on "core earnings" in operating its business because "core earnings" permit management to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of our operating segments. Accordingly, the tables presented below reflect "core earnings" which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of the Company's reportable segments. Included below under "Alternative Performance Measures" is further discussion regarding "core earnings" and its limitations, including a table that details the pre-tax differences between "core earnings" and GAAP by reportable segment.
        The Lending operating segment includes all discussion of income and related expenses associated with the net interest margin, the student loan spread and its components, the provisions for loan losses, and other fees earned on our Managed portfolio of student loans. The DMO operating segment reflects the fees earned and expenses incurred in providing accounts receivable management and collection services. Our Corporate and Other reportable segment includes our remaining fee businesses and other corporate expenses that do not pertain directly to the primary segments identified above.
        In the first quarter of 2006, the Company changed its method for allocating certain Corporate and Other expenses to the other business segments. All periods presented have been updated to reflect the new allocation methodology.
(1)
Operating expenses for the Lending, DMO, and Corporate and Other Business segments include $10 million, $3 million, and $5 million, respectively, of stock-based employee compensation expense due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006.

Reconciliation of "Core Earnings" Net Income to GAAP Net Income
(2)
Such tax effect is based upon the Company's "core earnings" effective tax rate for the year. The net tax effect results primarily from the exclusion of the permanent income tax impact of the equity forward contracts.
Limitations of "Core Earnings"
        While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, management believes that "core earnings" are an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations. Nevertheless, "core earnings" are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, as stated above, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our "core earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Unlike GAAP, "core earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP. Accordingly, the Company's "core earnings" presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not compare our Company's performance with that of other financial services companies based upon "core earnings." "Core earnings" results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, the Company's board of directors, rating agencies and lenders to assess performance.
        Other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive "core earnings" results. For example, in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for "hedge treatment," as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges, we focus on the long-term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price on the fair value of such instruments during the period. Under GAAP, the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments (but not on the underlying hedged item) tend to show more volatility in the short term. While our presentation of our results on a Managed Basis provides important information regarding the performance of our Managed portfolio, a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold to a trust managed by us. While we believe that our Managed Basis presentation presents the economic substance of our Managed loan portfolio, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains. Our "core earnings" results exclude certain Floor Income, which is real cash income, from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods. Management's financial planning and valuation of operating results, however, does not take into account Floor Income because of its inherent uncertainty, except when it is economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts.
Pre-tax Differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP
        Our "core earnings" are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a "core earnings" basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision maker. Our "core earnings" are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Company's core business activities. "Core earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP, as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between GAAP and "core earnings" that follows, which includes further detail on each specific adjustments required to reconcile our "core earnings" segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.
1)
Securitization:
    Under GAAP, certain securitization transactions in our Lending operating segment are accounted for as sales of assets. Under "core earnings" for the Lending operating segment, we present all securitization transactions on a Managed Basis as long-term non-recourse financings. The upfront "gains" on sale from securitization transactions as well as ongoing "servicing and securitization revenue" presented in accordance with GAAP are excluded from "core earnings" and are replaced by the interest income, provisions for loan losses, and interest expense as they are
earned or incurred on the securitization loans. We also exclude transactions with our off-balance sheet trusts from "core earnings" as they are considered intercompany transactions on a Managed Basis.
The following table summarizes the securitization adjustments in our Lending business segment for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005.
2)
Derivative Accounting:
"Core earnings" exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses arising primarily in our Lending operating segment, and to a lesser degree in our Corporate and Other reportable segment, that are caused primarily by the one-sided mark-to-market derivative valuations prescribed by SFAS No. 133 on derivatives that do not qualify for "hedge treatment" under GAAP. Under "core earnings," we recognize the economic effect of these hedges, which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged item's life. "Core earnings" also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts that under SFAS No. 133, are required to be accounted for as derivatives and are marked-to-market through earnings.
SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria, as specified by SFAS No. 133, are met. We believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges, and as such, are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy. However, some of our derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts, certain Eurodollar futures contracts and certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts (discussed in detail below), do not qualify for "hedge treatment" as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the stand-alone derivative must be marked-to-market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item. "Gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net" are primarily caused by interest rate volatility, changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment.
Our Floor Income Contracts are written options which must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness under SFAS No. 133. Specifically, our Floor Income Contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the Floor Income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written Floor Income Contracts. Under SFAS No. 133, the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract. The change in the value of Floor Income Contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of Floor Income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary. This is
economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio, including our Retained Interests, earning Floor Income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under SFAS No. 133. We believe the Floor Income Contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of Floor Income earned over the contract period, thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on Floor Income for that period. Prior to SFAS No. 133, we accounted for Floor Income Contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts.
Basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt. We primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our fixed rate and LIBOR-based debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper, Prime or Treasury bill index. SFAS No. 133 requires that when using basis swaps, the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability. Our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk, however they do not meet this effectiveness test because our FFELP student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates. We also have basis swaps that do not meet the SFAS No. 133 effectiveness test that economically hedge off-balance sheet instruments. As a result, under GAAP these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in the income statement.
Generally, a decrease in current interest rates and the respective forward interest rate curves results in an unrealized loss related to our written Floor Income Contracts which is offset by an increase in the value of the economically hedged student loans. This increase is not recognized in income. We will experience unrealized gains/losses related to our basis swaps if the two underlying indices (and related forward curve) do not move in parallel.
Under SFAS No. 150, equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the Company's stock are required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133. As a result, we account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and mark them to market through earnings. They do not qualify as effective SFAS No. 133 hedges, as a requirement to achieve hedge accounting is the hedged item must impact net income and the settlement of these contracts through the purchase of our own stock does not impact net income.
The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133 on our net income for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005, and for the year ended December 31, 2005, when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the SFAS No. 133 implementation.

See "Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities" below for a detailed breakdown of the components of realized losses on derivative and hedging activities.
Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities
SFAS No. 133 requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as "realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities") that do not qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133 to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities, and the associated reclassification on a "core earnings" basis for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005.
(1)
"Unrealized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net" is comprised of the following unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses):
3)
Floor Income:
    The timing and amount (if any) of Floor Income earned in our Lending operating segment is uncertain and in excess of expected spreads. Therefore, we exclude such income from "core earnings" when it is not economically hedged. We employ derivatives, primarily Floor Income Contracts and futures, to economically hedge Floor Income. As discussed above in "Derivative Accounting," these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges, and therefore, under GAAP, they are marked-to-market through the "gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities, net" line on the income statement with no offsetting gain or loss recorded for the economically hedged items. For "core earnings," we reverse the fair value adjustments on the Floor Income Contracts and futures economically hedging Floor Income and include the amortization of net premiums received (net of Eurodollar futures contracts' realized gains or losses) in income.
The following table summarizes the Floor Income adjustments in our Lending business segment for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005 and for the year ended December 31, 2005.
4)
Other items:
    We exclude certain amortization of acquired intangibles. For the three months ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005, and for the year ended December 31, 2005, amortization of acquired intangibles totaled $14 million, $16 million, $13 million, and $61 million, respectively.
LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENT
        In our Lending business segment, we originate and acquire federally guaranteed student loans, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Education ("ED"), and Private Education Loans, which are not federally guaranteed. The majority of our Private Education Loans is made in conjunction with a FFELP Stafford loan and as a result is marketed through the same marketing channels as FFELP Stafford loans. While FFELP student loans and Private Education Loans have different overall risk profiles due to the federal guarantee of the FFELP student loans, they share many of the same characteristics such as similar repayment terms, the same marketing channel and sales force, and are originated and serviced on the same servicing platform. Finally, where possible, the borrower receives a single bill for both the federally guaranteed and privately underwritten loans.
        The following table includes "core earnings" results for our Lending business segment.

Student Loan Spread AnalysisManaged Basis
        The following table analyzes the earnings from our portfolio of Managed student loans on a "core earnings" basis (see "BUSINESS SEGMENTSPre-tax Differences between 'Core Earnings' and GAAP"). This presentation includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet student loans and derivatives that are economically hedging the student loans on the debt funding such loans. The table below also excludes Floor Income earned on the student loan portfolio but does include the amortization of upfront payments on Floor Income Contracts that we believe are economically hedging the Floor Income.
Discussion of Managed Basis Student Loan SpreadEffects of Significant Events in the Quarters Presented
        In the first quarter of 2006, we updated our assumptions for the qualification for Borrower Benefits to reflect trends in borrower behavior versus qualification requirements. These changes resulted in a reduction of our liability for Borrower Benefits of $15 million or 5 basis points. For the first quarter of 2005, the Managed Basis student loan spread before this impact was 1.82 percent.
        In the fourth quarter of 2005, we continued to process Consolidation Loan applications from the record volume received in the second quarter of 2005. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, a significant volume of our Consolidation Loans were consolidated with third party lenders through the Direct Lending program (see "LENDING BUSINESS SEGMENTConsolidation Loan Activity" for further discussion). Both of these factors resulted in an increase in student loan premium write-offs for
both FFELP Stafford and Consolidation Loans consolidated with third parties in the fourth quarter. Loans lost through consolidation benefit the student spread to a lesser extent through the write-off of Borrower Benefit reserves associated with these loans.
Discussion of Managed Basis Student Loan SpreadOther Quarter-over-Quarter Fluctuations
        The change in the first quarter 2006 spread versus the fourth quarter of 2005, after giving effect to the items discussed above, was impacted by the 9 percent increase in the average balance of higher yielding Private Education Loans, partially offset by the increase in the average balance of Consolidation Loans, which have lower spreads than other FFELP loans due primarily to the 105 basis point Consolidation Loan Rebate Fee.
        The average balance of Managed Private Education Loans now represents 14 percent of the average Managed student loan portfolio, up from 13 percent and 11 percent in the fourth and first quarter of 2005, respectively. Private Education Loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads, which averaged 4.88 percent in the first quarter of 2006 for the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio versus a spread of 1.37 percent (1.31 percent before the Borrower Benefit impact discussed above) in the first quarter of 2006 for the Managed guaranteed student loan portfolio.
Private Education Loans
        All Private Education Loans are initially acquired on-balance sheet. When we securitize Private Education Loans, we no longer legally own the loans and they are accounted for off-balance sheet. For our Managed presentation in the table above, we reduce the on-balance sheet allowance for amounts previously provided and then provide for these loans in the off-balance sheet section with the total of both on and off-balance sheet residing in the Managed presentation.
        When Private Education Loans in the majority of our securitized trusts become 180 days delinquent, we typically exercise our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and record a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase. If these loans reach the 212-day delinquency, a charge-off for the remaining balance of the loan is triggered. On a Managed Basis, the losses recorded under GAAP for loans repurchased at day 180 are reversed and the full amount is charged-off at day 212.
        The off-balance sheet allowance is increasing as more loans are securitized but is lower than the on-balance sheet percentage when measured as a percentage of ending loans in repayment because of the different mix of loans on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet, as described above. Additionally, a larger percentage of the off-balance sheet loan borrowers are still in-school status and not required to make payments on their loans. Once repayment begins, the allowance requirements increase to reflect the increased risk of loss as loans enter repayment.
Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses
        The following tables summarize changes in the allowance for Private Education Loan losses for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
        The increase in the provision in the first quarter of 2006 versus the fourth quarter of 2005 is primarily driven by the seasonality of loans entering repayment. The majority of loans typically enter repayment in the second and fourth quarters. This increase in loans entering repayment often leads to a near-term increase in early-stage delinquencies, or forbearance usage in the first and third quarters for the affected borrowers, which in turn leads to a spike in the provision for those quarters. Therefore, all other factors being equal, the provision for loan losses will be higher in the first and third quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the provision was also reduced by lower default rates based on improved default experience caused by an increased emphasis by our internal DMO collection efforts on our portfolios.
Delinquencies
        The tables below present our Private Education Loan delinquency trends as of March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005. Delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings through increased servicing and collection costs in the event the delinquent accounts charge off.

ForbearanceManaged Basis Private Education Loans
        Private Education Loans are made to parent and student borrowers by our lender partners in accordance with our underwriting policies. These loans generally supplement federally guaranteed student loans, which are subject to federal lending caps. Private Education Loans are not guaranteed or insured against any loss of principal or interest. Traditional student borrowers use the proceeds of these loans to obtain higher education, which increases the likelihood of obtaining employment at higher income levels than would be available without the additional education. As a result, the borrowers' repayment capability improves between the time the loan is made and the time they enter the post-education work force. We generally allow the loan repayment period on traditional Private Education Loans, except those generated by our SLM Financial subsidiary, to begin six to nine months after the student leaves school. This provides the borrower time to obtain a job to service his or her debt. For borrowers that need more time or experience other hardships, we permit additional delays in payment or partial payments (both referred to as forbearances) when we believe additional time will improve the borrower's ability to repay the loan. Forbearance is also granted to borrowers who may experience temporary hardship after entering repayment, when we believe that it will increase the likelihood of ultimate collection of the loan. Such forbearance is only granted within established guidelines and is closely monitored for compliance. Our policy does not grant any reduction in the repayment obligation (principal or interest) but does allow the borrower to stop or reduce monthly payments for an agreed period of time. When a loan that was delinquent prior to receiving forbearance, ends forbearance and re-enters repayment, that loan is returned to current status.
        Forbearance is used most heavily immediately after the loan enters repayment. As indicated in the tables below showing the composition and status of the Managed Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment, the percentage of loans in forbearance decreases the longer the loans have been in repayment. At March 31, 2006, loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance is 16.1 percent for loans that have been in repayment one to twenty-four months. The percentage drops to 4.5 percent for loans that have been in repayment more than 48 months. Approximately 79 percent of our Managed Private Education Loans in forbearance have been in repayment less than 24 months. These borrowers are essentially extending their grace period as they transition to the workforce. Forbearance continues to be a positive collection tool for the Private Education Loans as we believe it can provide the borrower with sufficient time to obtain employment and income to support his or her obligation. We consider the potential impact of forbearance in the determination of the loan loss reserves.
        The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment:
(1)
Includes all loans in-school/grace/deferment.

Includes all loans in-school/grace/deferment.
        The increase in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance in the first quarter of 2006 is due to seasonality.
        The table below stratifies the portfolio of Managed Private Education Loans in forbearance by the cumulative number of months the borrower has used forbearance as of the dates indicated. As detailed in the table below, six percent of loans currently in forbearance have been in loan repayment more than 24 months, which is one percent lower versus the prior quarter and three percent lower than the year-ago period.
Total Loan Net Charge-offs
        The following tables summarize the total loan net charge-offs on both an on-balance sheet basis and a Managed Basis for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.

Student Loan Premiums Paid
        The following table illustrates the amount and rate of the student loan premiums paid.
(1)
Primarily includes spot purchases, other commitment clients, and subsidiary acquisitions.
Consolidation Loan Activity
        The following table presents the effect of Consolidation Loan activity on our Managed FFELP portfolio.
(1)
FFELP category is primarily Stafford loans and also includes PLUS and HEAL loans.
(2)
On a Managed Basis, internal consolidations include FFELP student loans in securitization trusts that were consolidated back on-balance sheet. Such loans totaled $.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005, respectively.
        The net reduction in FFELP loans from consolidations is primarily due to some FFELP lenders reconsolidating Consolidation Loans using the Direct Lending program as a pass-through entity to circumvent the statutory prohibition on the reconsolidation of Consolidation Loans. The legislation reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act (see RECENT DEVELOPMENTSReauthorization) eliminates this practice by June 30, 2006, however, on March 17, 2006, ED issued a "Dear Colleague" letter that prohibits the reconsolidation of Consolidation Loans through the Direct Lending program unless the borrower applied for a Direct Loan consolidation by March 31, 2006. Accordingly, we expect a temporary increase in the reconsolidation of Consolidation Loans through April, as the back log of Direct Loan applications are processed, after which we expect to see the consolidation activity return to recent historical levels.
Other IncomeLending Business Segment
        The following table summarizes the components of other income for our Lending business segment for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
        At March 31, 2006, we had investments in leveraged and direct financing leases, net of impairments, totaling $116 million that are primarily general obligations of American Airlines and Federal Express Corporation. Based on an analysis of the potential losses on certain leveraged leases plus the increase in incremental tax obligations related to the forgiveness of debt obligations and/or the
taxable gain on the sale of the aircraft, our remaining after-tax accounting exposure from our investment in American Airlines is $56 million at March 31, 2006.
Operating ExpensesLending Business Segment
        Operating expenses for our Lending business segment include costs incurred to service our Managed student loan portfolio and acquire student loans, as well as other general and administrative expenses. The increase in first quarter operating expenses is primarily due to the increase in sales expenses as we shift more volume to our internal brands. First quarter 2006 operating expenses for the Lending business segment also include $10 million of stock-based employee compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) (see "RESULTS OF OPERATIONSStock-Based Employee Compensation Expense").
DEBT MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS ("DMO") BUSINESS SEGMENT
        The following table includes "core earnings" results for our DMO business segment.
DMO Revenue by Product
(1)
United Student Aid Funds, Inc. ("USA Funds")
        Total DMO revenue increased by $1 million in the first quarter of 2006 versus the fourth quarter of 2005. The fourth quarter of 2005 benefited from revenue generated through state tax collections in the other contingency category. The $27 million, or 22 percent, increase in DMO revenue for the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005 can be attributed to the year-over-year growth in the purchased paper businesses of Arrow Financial Services and to revenue generated by GRP Financial Services (acquired in August 2005). The year-over-year growth in contingency fee revenue was primarily driven by the growth in the credit card and guaranty agency collections.
Purchased PaperNon-Mortgage
        The amount of face value of purchases in any quarter is a function of a combination of factors including the amount of receivables available for purchase in the marketplace, average age of each portfolio, the asset class of the receivables, and competition in the marketplace. As a result, the percentage of principal purchased will vary from quarter to quarter. The decrease in collections revenue as a percentage of GCC can primarily be attributed to the increase in new portfolio purchases in the second half of 2005. Typically, revenue recognition based on a portfolio's effective interest rate is a lower percentage of cash collections in the early stages of servicing a portfolio.
Purchased PaperMortgage/Properties
(1)
GRP was purchased in August 2005. Prior to this acquisition, the Company was not in the mortgage purchased paper business.
        The purchase price for sub-performing and non-performing mortgage loans is generally determined as a percentage of the underlying collateral. Fluctuations in the purchase price as a percentage of collateral value can be caused by a number of factors including the percentage of second mortgages in the portfolio and the level of private mortgage insurance associated with particular assets.
Contingency Inventory
        The following table presents the outstanding inventory of receivables serviced through our DMO business.
Operating ExpensesDMO Business Segment
        Operating expenses for our DMO business segment increased by $5 million, or 6 percent, to $89 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 versus the prior quarter, and by $25 million or 39 percent versus the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating expenses versus the prior and year-ago quarters was primarily due to increased expenses for outsourced collections and recovery costs associated with large fourth quarter portfolio purchases. The increases in DMO contingency fee expenses are consistent with the growth in revenue and accounts serviced, as a high percentage of DMO expenses are variable.
        First quarter 2006 operating expenses for the DMO business segment also include $3 million of stock-based employee compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) (see "RESULTS OF OPERATIONSStock-Based Employee Compensation Expense").
CORPORATE AND OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT
        The following table includes "core earnings" results for our Corporate and Other business segment.
Fee and Other IncomeCorporate and Other Business Segment
        The following table summarizes the components of fee and other income for our Corporate and Other business segment for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
        The increase in guarantor servicing fees over the prior quarter can primarily be attributed to the seasonality of the issuance fee received from new loan guarantees made on behalf of USA Funds. The decrease in guarantor servicing fees versus the year-ago quarter is due to an $8 million reduction in account maintenance fees caused by a cap on payments from ED to guarantors. This cap is removed by legislation reauthorizing the student loan programs of the Higher Education Act (see RECENT DEVELOPMENTSReauthorization) that will not go into effect before October 1, 2006, so it will negatively impact guarantor servicing earnings at least through that date.
        USA Funds, the nation's largest guarantee agency, accounted for 82 percent, 79 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of guarantor servicing fees and 31 percent, 22 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of revenues associated with other products and services for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and March 31, 2005.
Operating ExpensesCorporate and Other Business Segment
        Operating expenses for our Corporate and Other business segment include direct costs incurred to service loans for unrelated third parties and to perform guarantor servicing on behalf of guarantor agencies, as well as information technology expenses related to these functions. First quarter 2006 operating expenses for our Corporate and Other business segment also include $5 million of stock-based employee compensation expense, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) (see "RESULTS OF OPERATIONSStock-Based Employee Compensation Expense").
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Reauthorization
        On February 8, 2006, the President signed the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 ("Reconciliation Legislation"). The Reconciliation Legislation was included as Title VIII of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (S. 1932), an omnibus budget bill that cut nearly $40 billion in spending over five years, with $12 billion coming from federal student loan programs. The vast majority of the savings are generated by requiring lenders to rebate Floor Income under the new loans issued after April 1, 2006. The major new student loan provisions include the following, with effective dates generally July 1, 2006 unless otherwise indicated:
 - 
Lenders rebate Floor Income on new loans after April 1, 2006.
 - 
Borrower origination fees are gradually reduced to zero in FFELP by 2010, and to one percent in Direct Loan program by 2010.
 - 
Collection of one percent FFELP guaranty fee is mandated for all guarantors, including those with voluntary flexible agreements, but can be paid on behalf of the borrower by lenders or guarantors.
 - 
Lender reinsurance is reduced to 99 percent with Exceptional Performer designation for claims filed after July 1, 2006, and 97 percent without designation on loans disbursed after July 1, 2006.
 - 
"Super 2-Step" and in-school consolidation loopholes will be closed as of July 1, 2006.
 - 
Recycling of 9.5 percent loans is prohibited for loan holders with more than $100 million in 9.5 percent loans, as of date of enactment, and other 9.5 percent reforms enacted in 2004 are made permanent.
 - 
The limitation on SAP for PLUS loans made after January 1, 2000 is repealed.
 - 
Loan limits are increased as of July 1, 2007.
 - 
A moratorium on new schools-as-lender is created after April 1, 2006, and additional requirements are created for schools continuing to participate in this program.
 - 
Graduate students become eligible to take out PLUS loans.
 - 
Compensation for guarantor collections via loan consolidation is reduced from a maximum of 18.5 percent to 10 percent, along with a cap on the proportion of collection via consolidations. Requirements for collections via loan rehabilitations are made somewhat easier.
 - 
New grant programs are available for Pell-eligible students.
        The Reconciliation Legislation does not change the interest rates on Stafford loans which, under legislation enacted in 2002, are scheduled to become fixed 6.8 percent for all loans disbursed after July 1, 2006. Under the previous legislation, the PLUS rate was scheduled to become fixed at 7.9 percent after July 1, 2006. The Reconciliation Legislation raises this rate to 8.5 percent for FFELP PLUS loans. Due to a drafting error in the bill, the PLUS rate for the FDLP was not changed and
remains at 7.9 percent in the statute. Committee Staff have acknowledged this error and we expect it to be corrected prior to the July 1 effective date. The rates for Consolidation Loans are unchanged by the Reconciliation Legislation; the formula remains the weighted average of the rates on the underling loans, rounded up to the nearest eighth.
st
        The Reconciliation Legislation reauthorizes the student loan programs through 2012. However, the reauthorization of the rest of the Higher Education Act is still pending, with that authorization only temporarily extended to June 30, 2006. On March 30, 2006, the House passed H.R. 609, which would complete HEA reauthorization. It is unclear whether the Senate will take up this legislation this session. Should the Senate proceed, there may be amendments affecting the student loan programs, but because the Reconciliation Legislation reauthorized the student loan programs, we believe there should not be significant political pressure for major changes this year. In the House-passed legislation, there were only a few provisions that affected the student loan programs. Included in that bill was the repeal of the single holder rule of consolidation loans which had been included in the Deficit Reduction Act until it was dropped for procedural reasons.
