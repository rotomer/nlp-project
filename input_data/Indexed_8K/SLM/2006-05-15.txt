In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. The consent in this last sentence shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and the indemnifying party agrees that the indemnified party shall in all cases be justified in withholding consent unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 6(a) or 6(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other, from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 6(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Notes (before deducting expenses) received
21
by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent from the Company in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand or by any Agent, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by or through such Agent were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Agents under this Section 6(d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
(e)           The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

Prior to the specified exchange date, the Trustee will deliver to the CUSIP Service Bureau written notice setting forth such exchange date and the new CUSIP number and stating that, as of such exchange date, the CUSIP numbers of the Global Notes to be exchanged will no longer be valid.
On the specified exchange date, the Trustee will exchange such Global Notes for a single Global Note bearing the new CUSIP number. The CUSIP numbers of the exchanged Global Notes will, in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedures, be cancelled and not immediately reassigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Global Notes to be exchanged exceed $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, one replacement Global Note will be authenticated and issued to represent each $500,000,000 of principal amount of the exchanged Global Notes and an additional Global Note will be authenticated and issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Global Notes, subject to the minimum denomination restrictions described in General Procedures - Denominations (see "Denominations" below).
Global Notes representing Book-Entry Notes will be denominated in principal amounts not in excess of $500,000,000. If one or more Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate principal amount in excess of $500,000,000 would, but for the preceding sentence, be represented by a single Global Note, then one Global Note will be issued to represent each $500,000,000 principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Book-Entry Notes and an additional Global Note will be issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Book- Entry Note or Book-Entry Notes, subject to the minimum denomination restrictions described in General Procedures - Denominations. In such a case, each of the Global Notes representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes shall be assigned the same CUSIP number.

                                                                                                                                   60;

If withdrawal messages are processed with respect to a portion of the Book-Entry Notes represented by a Global Note, the Trustee will exchange such Global Note for two Global Notes, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Notes (which shall be cancelled immediately after issuance), and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry Notes previously represented by the surrendered Global Note and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Note. If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Note is not timely paid to the Participants with respect to such Note by the beneficial purchaser (other than a Purchasing Agent) thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in DTC, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such Participants and, in turn, the related Agent may enter SDFS deliver orders through DTC's Participant Terminal System debiting such Note free to such Agent's Participant Account and crediting such Note free to the Participant Account of the Trustee and shall notify the Trustee and the Company thereof.

therefor:
                                                                                                                                     60;                                                 
If either (i) the Certificated Note is denominated in U.S. dollars or (ii) the Certificated Note is denominated in a currency or currency unit other than U.S. dollars and, at or prior to the Settlement Date, the Company and the Selling Agent have entered into, or the Selling Agent has arranged for the Company to enter into, a contract with respect to the sale of the Specified Currency, the amount payable by the Selling Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be the issue price of the Certificated Note (or the U.S. dollar equivalent pursuant to such contract) less the Selling Agent's commission determined in accordance with Section 3(a) of the Distribution Agreement. In all other cases, the Selling Agent's commission shall not be discounted from the gross proceeds but shall be paid separately by the Company in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds on the Settlement Date. The payment by the Selling Agent shall be made only upon prior receipt by such Agent of immediately available funds from or on behalf of the purchaser in the Specified Currency unless such Agent decides, at its option, to advance its own funds for such payment against subsequent receipt of funds from the purchaser.

If the Certificated Note has been delivered to the Selling Agent on behalf of the purchaser, the Selling Agent will immediately return the Certificated Note to the Trustee. If funds have been advanced by the Selling Agent for the purchase of such Note, the Trustee will, upon instruction by the Company and upon receipt of the Certificated Note, debit the account of the Company in an amount equal to the amount previously credited thereto in respect of the Note and will either credit the account of or return such funds to the Selling Agent. Such debits and credits or returns will be made on the Settlement Date if possible and, in any event, not later than the business day following the Settlement Date. If such failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the Selling Agent in the performance of its obligations under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Selling Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of the funds during the period when they were credited to the account of the Company. In addition, if such failure shall have occurred by reason of a default by the Company in the performance of its obligations under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will pay the Selling Agent any commission to which it would have been entitled in connection with such sale.
Failures:

Exchange Act
(x)            To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;

In the event that the results of auctions of 91-day Treasury bills cease to be published or reported as provided above, or that no 91-day Treasury bill auction is held in a particular week, then the 91-day Treasury bill rate in effect as a result of the last such publication or report will remain in effect until such time, if any, as the results of auctions of 91-day Treasury bills will again be so published or reported or such auction is held, as the case may be.
