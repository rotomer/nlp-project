("Barclays"), Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ("Credit Suisse"), Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("Deutsche Bank") and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC ("Wachovia") in connection with our offering of $2 billion of the Company's common stock.

Item 5.03 
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Changes in Fiscal Year
 
                On December 28, 2007, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations. The Certificate of Designations classified 1,000,000 unissued shares of Company preferred stock, par value $0.20 per share, as "7.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C" (the "Series C Preferred Stock"). The 1,000,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock have the preferences and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption as set forth in the Certificate of Designations.  On December 31, 2007, the Company consummated its public offering of 1,000,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock; net proceeds to it from the sale of the Series C Preferred Stock, after deducting underwriting fees and before other fees and expenses of the offering, are approximately $970 million.
 
Copies of the (1) Certificate of Designations and (2) forms of stock certificates evidencing the 7.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C, are attached as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
Item 8.01  .
Other Events
 
                Set forth below is a brief summary of certain recent developments relating to our business that were disclosed in the offering documents in connection with our concurrent public offerings of the Series C Preferred Stock and $2 billion of SLM Corporation common stock.
 
Merger-related developments
 
                On December 12, 2007, we announced an update of the transaction (the "Merger") with the buyer group led by J.C. Flowers & Co., Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (the "Buyer Group"). Over the prior eight weeks, in a series of discussions between the Company and senior representatives of the Buyer Group, to resolve the dispute between the parties, we offered to consider an alternative transaction with the Buyer Group, and to give them the opportunity to update their due diligence and submit a new proposal to acquire the Company with no pre-conditions. The Buyer Group responded that it did not wish to pursue these opportunities. For additional developments relating to the Merger, see "Legal proceedings" below and "Recent DevelopmentsMerger-Related Developments" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.
 
 
Business trends
 
                On December 12, 2007, we announced that our business has recently been negatively affected as a result of higher funding costs (including the costs of utilizing, and the expected costs of refinancing, the Interim ABCP Facility, defined below), and increased reserves for our Federal Family Education Loan Program ("FFELP") loan portfolio. In addition, our business has been negatively affected by an index mismatch between the commercial paper rate, the index for determining the interest rate we earn on the vast majority of our FFELP student loan assets, and LIBOR, the index for determining the interest rates on a substantial portion of our debt used to fund these assets.
 
                Our management team is evaluating certain aspects of our business as a response to the impact on our business of The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (the "Act"), and current challenges in the capital markets. The Act has a number of important implications for the profitability of our FFELP business, including a reduction in special allowance payments, the elimination of the "Exceptional Performer" designation and the corresponding reduction in default payments to 97% through 2012 and 95% thereafter, an increase in the lender paid origination fees for certain loan types and reduction in default collections retention fees, and account maintenance fees related to guaranty agency activities. As a result, we expect that the Act will significantly reduce and, combined with higher financing costs, could possibly eliminate the profitability of new FFELP loan originations, while increasing our risk sharing from our FFELP loan portfolio.
 
                In response to the Act and market conditions, we plan to be more selective in pursuing origination activity, in both FFELP loans and private education loans. In addition, we plan to curtail less profitable student loan acquisition activities such as spot purchases and wholesale consolidation loan purchases, which will reduce our funding needs. We expect to see many participants exit the student loan industry in response to the Act as well as current market conditions and we therefore expect to partially offset declining loan volumes caused by our more selective lending policies with increased market share taken from participants exiting the industry. We expect to continue to focus on generally higher-margin Private Education Loans, both through our school channel and our direct to consumer channel, although in the case of the latter, with particular attention to continuing the more stringent underwriting standards that are necessary in this market. We also expect to adjust our private education loan pricing to reflect the current financing and market conditions. We also plan to eliminate certain borrower benefits offered in connection with both our FFELP loans and our private education loans. We will further de-emphasize pursuing incremental consolidation loans, in particular FFELP consolidation loans, as a result of significant margin erosion for FFELP consolidation loans created by the combined effect of the Act and the increased cost of borrowing in the current capital markets. Nevertheless we will continue our efforts to protect selected FFELP assets existing in our portfolio. We expect to continue to aggressively pursue other FFELP-related fee income opportunities such as FFELP loan servicing, guarantor servicing and collections.
 
Liquidity
 
                In light of the decision of the Buyer Group not to close the Merger, our management team has been working to refinance the aggregate interim $30 billion asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities (collectively, the "Interim ABCP Facility") entered into in connection with the Merger and to secure additional financing in order to fund our business, to strengthen our balance sheet and to support our credit ratings. Our Interim ABCP Facility effectively terminates on May 16, 2008, but our cost of funding under the facility will increase substantially if the facility is not refinanced on or prior to February 15, 2008 and we will not be able to borrow additional amounts thereunder after that date.
 
 
                For 2006 and for the first nine months of 2007, our primary source of cost-effective funding was student loan asset-backed securities, or ABS, financings. Upon the announcement of the Merger on April 16, 2007, credit spreads in our unsecured debt widened considerably, significantly increasing our cost of accessing the unsecured debt markets. More recently, as with similarly sized financial companies, adverse conditions in the securitization markets have increased the cost of issuance and borrowing spreads in the market for student loan ABS. In the third quarter of 2007, we completed only one $2.5 billion securitization transaction, compared to four securitization transactions totaling $13.0 billion in the first quarter of 2007, the last full quarter before we entered into the merger agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed three securitization transactions totaling $5.0 billion. Although we expect ABS financings to remain our primary source of funding, we expect our transaction volumes in the ABS market to be more limited and pricing terms less favorable than in the past, with significantly reduced opportunities to issue subordinated tranches of ABS. Consequently in order to meet our financing needs, we are exploring other sources of funding, including unsecured debt, a financing source we have not used to fund our core businesses since the announcement of the Merger. We expect the terms and conditions of new unsecured debt issuances, including pricing terms and covenant requirements, will be less favorable to us than our recent ABS financings and other unsecured debt we have incurred in the past. In addition, our ability to access the unsecured market on attractive terms, or at all, will depend on our credit rating and prevailing market conditions.
 
                We also fund our liquidity needs through our existing $6.0 billion asset-backed commercial paper, or ABCP facility, our cash and investment portfolio and by selectively disposing of FFELP student loans in the secondary market. In addition, we maintain, to supplement our funding sources, $6.5 billion in unsecured revolving credit facilities. However, we have not in the past relied upon, and do not expect to rely on, our unsecured revolving credit facilities as a primary source of liquidity. Although we have never borrowed under these facilities, they provide liquidity support for general corporate purposes, including backup for our unsecured commercial paper program.
 
                Our ability to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities will depend upon our ability to meet financial covenants set forth in the credit agreements, including a covenant to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least $1.38 billion, compliance with which will be affected by a variety of factors, including mark-to-market accounting adjustments applied principally to our derivatives, including our equity forwards, and our residual interests in off-balance sheet securitized loans. One of the purposes of our recent offerings of common stock and the Series C Preferred Stock was to provide us with additional assurance that we will be able to comply with the consolidated tangible net worth covenant as of December 31, 2007.  If we fail to comply with the consolidated tangible net worth covenant in our revolving credit facilities at that date or in the future, the banks party to the facilities (which include Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, members of the Buyer Group against whom we have filed a lawsuit, as lenders and agents under the facilities) may elect to terminate their commitments, and if they did elect to terminate the facilities, our available liquidity could be materially impaired.
 
                We have an aggregate of $8.4 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2008 in addition to our Interim ABCP Facility. With respect to our Interim ABCP Facility, we are in substantive discussion with 10 financial institutions to provide short-term warehouse funding in excess of $30 billion. While we are in substantive discussions with these parties, with the goal of replacing the Interim ABCP Facility before February 15, 2008, we do not hold commitments for any such replacement financing and cannot be sure that we will come to mutually satisfactory terms and conditions.
 
 
                In addition, in order to provide funding for our business, repay maturing debt and enhance our liquidity, we may enter into new credit facilities and issue additional equity-linked securities or common stock.
 
Ratings
 
                Our management team intends to focus on maintaining, and ultimately improving, our credit ratings. Our credit ratings may affect, among other things, our cost of funding, especially in the unsecured debt markets, and, to a lesser extent, the volume and price of securitization transactions we can execute. Also, as discussed in "Risk factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, a decrease in our credit ratings may affect the ability of counterparties to terminate our swap contracts.  We cannot provide any assurance that our recent offerings of common stock and Series C Preferred Stock, or any other amount of equity capital will be sufficient to maintain our ratings at any particular level. We may issue additional equity in the form of common stock as we deem necessary to maintain, and ultimately improve, our credit ratings.
 
Forward agreements
 
                The Company intends to use approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds from the concurrent offerings described above to settle its outstanding equity forward contract with Citibank, N.A. and repurchase the 44,039,890 shares of common stock deliverable to the Company under the contract.  The Company and Citibank, N.A. have agreed to physically settle the contract, and the Company has paid Citibank, N.A. approximately $1.1 billion, the difference between the contract purchase price and the market closing price on December 28, 2007 on the approximate 44 million shares.  Consequently, the common shares outstanding on the Company's year-end balance sheet will reflect the shares issued in the public offerings and the physical settlement of the equity forward contract.  The Company will pay Citibank, N.A. the remaining balance due under the contract in early January 2008.
 
Dividends
 
                We have not paid any dividends on our common stock since the execution of the merger agreement with the Buyer Group in April 2007. While the restriction on the payment of dividends under the merger agreement has been terminated, we expect to continue not paying dividends in the near term in order to focus on balance sheet improvement and expect to re-examine our dividend policy in the second half of 2008.
 
Management changes and sales of securities
 
                On December 14, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors added the Chief Executive Officer title and responsibilities to our Executive Chairman Albert L. Lord. C.E. Andrews, our previous CEO, assumed the role of President.
 
                On the same date, we announced we had opened our trading window for directors and executive officers for the first time since we commenced discussions with the Buyer Group in March 2007. Mr. Lord sold approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 97% of the common stock that he owned before the sale, on the open market on December 14, 2007. Also on December 14, 2007, Mr. Charles Daley, a director, sold approximately 80,023 shares of our common stock or approximately 68% of the common stock that he owned before the sale. Messrs. Lord and Daley have advised us that these actions were required under their respective borrowing arrangements.
 
Legal proceedings
 
                With respect to the lawsuit that we filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Buyer Group, on November 21, 2007, we withdrew our October 19, 2007 motion for partial summary judgment on the pleadings. Discovery proceedings have commenced and the Court has indicated that the trial will commence in early December 2008.
 
                On December 14, 2007, we sent a letter to the Buyer Group in which we asked the Buyer Group either to confirm that it had terminated the merger agreement or provide adequate assurances that the Buyer Group intended to close the Merger. Our letter further asserted that the Buyer Group had breached the merger agreement in a variety of ways and gave the Buyer Group notice as provided for under the merger agreement that if such breaches were not timely cured, we reserved the right to terminate the merger agreement and to seek damages thereunder for such breaches. The Buyer Group responded to us in a letter dated December 21, 2007, in which the Buyer Group failed to provide the requested adequate assurances of its intent to consummate the Merger and failed to address the notices of default in our letter. In its letter the Buyer Group asserted that the "required information" previously provided by us pursuant to the merger agreement had proven to be inaccurate, that the Buyer Group nevertheless continued to seek FDIC approval for the change of control of Sallie Mae Bank in connection with the Merger and that, were the conditions to closing of the Merger be measured as of the date of the Buyer Group letter, such conditions precedent would not be satisfied.
 
                In August 2005, Rhonda Salmeron (the "Plaintiff") filed a qui tam whistleblower case under the False Claims Act against collection company Enterprise Recovery Systems, Inc., or ERS. In the fall of 2006, Plaintiff amended her complaint and added USA Group Loan Services, Inc., or USA Funds, as a defendant. On September 17, 2007, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint adding Sallie Mae Inc. as a defendant. Plaintiff alleges that the various defendants submitted false claims and/or created records to support false claims in connection with collection activity on federally guaranteed student loans. The Company is being sued as a successor to USA Group. The allegations against USA Group and the Company are that they were negligent in auditing ERS. Plaintiff claims that the U.S. government has been damaged in an amount greater than $12 million. The False Claims Act provides for treble damages to successful qui tam plaintiffs.
 
                On September 11, 2007, the Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, of the U.S. Department of Education (the "Department"), confirmed that they planned to conduct an audit to determine if the Company billed for special allowance payments, under the 9.5% floor calculation, in compliance with the Higher Education Act, regulations and guidance issued by the Department. We ceased billing under the 9.5% floor calculation at the end of 2006. We believe that our billing practices were consistent with longstanding Department guidance, but there can be no assurance that the OIG will not advocate an interpretation that differs from the Department's previous guidance.
 
                On December 17, 2007, Sasha Rodriguez and Cathelyn Gregoire filed a putative class action claim on behalf of themselves and persons similarly situated against us in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleging an intentional violation of civil rights laws (42 U.S.C. 1981, 1982), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Truth in Lending Act. Plaintiffs allege that we engaged in underwriting practices which resulted, among other things, in certain applicants being directed into substandard and more expensive student loans on the basis of race. No amount in controversy is stated in the complaint.  We intend to vigorously defend this action.

Proceeding
indemnified party
indemnifying party
9
, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise.  The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
provided
however
indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that, except as provided in the second paragraph of Section 9(a), such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) 
and (b) 
of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.
 
(e)          
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
. 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.
 
(f)           
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Shares.  The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares, or in connection with the Registration Statement,
any Basic Prospectus,
any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.

indemnifying party

, such indemnified party shall promptly notify such indemnifying party in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; , , that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party or otherwise.  The indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that, except as provided in the second paragraph of Section 9(a), such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
provided
however
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) 
and (b) 
of this Section 9 or insufficient to hold an indemnified party harmless in respect of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages,
expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares. 
The relative benefits received by UBS in its capacity as "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of FINRA Conduct Rule 2720) shall be deemed to be equal to the compensation received by the QIU for acting in such capacity. 
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.

The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
and the QIU, in its capacity as "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of FINRA Conduct Rule 2720), shall in no event be required to contribute any amount in excess of the compensation received by the QIU for acting in such capacity. 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.

The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this

The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares, or in connection with the Registration Statement,

(y)           increase the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued on conversion by a number equal to (A) the sum of any accumulated and declared and unpaid dividends and the Cash Acquisition Dividend Make-Whole Amount, divided by (B) the Stock Price; and
 
(ii)           if the Corporation has not declared all or any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends payable on the Effective Date, the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate will be adjusted so that converting Holders receive an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends that have not been declared (the " "), divided by the Stock Price; , that in no event shall the Corporation increase the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in excess of the Share Cap. To the extent that the Corporation does not deliver any or all additional shares as a result of the Share Cap, the Holders shall not have any claim whatsoever against the Corporation in respect of the remaining Cash Acquisition Conversion Additional Conversion Amount.

(11)         . (a) Pursuant to Section 8, on the Mandatory Conversion Date, any outstanding shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of Common Stock.  The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon mandatory conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be treated as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Mandatory Conversion Date.  Except as provided under Section 14(c)(iii), prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Mandatory Conversion Date, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose and Holders shall have no rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock, by virtue of holding the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.
Conversion Procedures
 
(b)           To effect an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 9, a Holder who:
 
(i)            holds a beneficial interest in a Global Preferred Share must deliver to DTC the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to DTC's conversion program and, if required, pay funds equal to the dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled by virtue of Section 9(b) and, if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any; or
 
(ii)           holds shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in certificated form must:
 
(A)          complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock certificate or a facsimile of the conversion notice;
 
(B)           deliver the completed conversion notice and the certificated shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted to the Conversion and Dividend Disbursing Agent;
 
(C)           if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;
 
 
 
(D)          if required, pay funds equal to the dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled by virtue of Section 9(b) which provides that, with respect to declared dividends, an early converting Holder is entitled to receive as of the Early Conversion Date only all accumulated and declared and unpaid dividends for all prior Dividend Periods ending on or prior to the Dividend Payment Date immediately preceding the Early Conversion Date (other than previously declared dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock payable to Record Holders as of a prior Record Date); and
 
(E)           if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any.
 
The Early Conversion will be effective on the date on which a Holder has satisfied all of the foregoing requirements, to the extent applicable ("").  A Holder will not be required to pay any transfer or similar taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Common Stock if such Holder exercises its conversion rights, but such Holder will be required to pay any transfer or similar tax or duty that may be payable relating to any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of Common Stock in a name other than the name of such Holder. A certificate representing Common Stock will be issued and delivered only after all applicable taxes and duties, if any, payable by the Holder have been paid in full.
Early Conversion Date
 
The person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon Early Conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Early Conversion Date.  No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 14(c)(iii), shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such applicable Early Conversion Date.  Prior to such applicable Early Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
In the event that an Early Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock representing less than all the shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock held by a Holder, upon such Early Conversion the Corporation shall execute and the Registrar shall countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation, a certificate evidencing the shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as to which Early Conversion was not effected.
 
The Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock and the amount of cash, if any, to which the Holder converting pursuant to Section 9 is entitled on or prior to the third Trading Day immediately following the Early Conversion Date.
 
(c)           To effect a Cash Acquisition Conversion pursuant to Section 10, a Holder shall deliver to the Conversion and Dividend Disbursing Agent at any time during the Cash Acquisition Conversion Period, the certificate(s) (if such shares are held in certificated form) evidencing the shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to which the Cash Acquisition Conversion right is being exercised, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation, or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto, or in blank, with a written notice to the Corporation stating the Holder's intention to convert early in connection with the Cash Acquisition containing the information set forth in Section 11(b)(ii) and paying the transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any.  If a Holder holds a beneficial interest in a Global Preferred Share, such Holder must deliver to DTC the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to DTC's conversion program and, if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes or duties, if any.
 
The Cash Acquisition Conversion will be effective on the date on which a Holder has satisfied all of the foregoing requirements, to the extent applicable (the "").  A Holder will not be required to pay any transfer or similar taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Common Stock if such Holder exercises its conversion rights, but such Holder will be required to pay any transfer or similar tax or duty that may be payable relating to any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of Common Stock in a name other than the name of such Holder.  A certificate representing Common Stock will be issued and delivered only after all applicable taxes and duties, if any, payable by the Holder have been paid in full.  For the avoidance of doubt, Holders who do not submit their conversion notice during the Cash Acquisition Conversion Period shall not be entitled to convert their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate or to receive the Cash Acquisition Dividend Make-Whole Amount.
Cash Acquisition Conversion Date
 
 
The person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such Cash Acquisition Conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable Cash Acquisition Conversion Date. No allowance or adjustment, except as set forth in Section 14(c)(iii), shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record as of any date prior to such applicable Cash Acquisition Conversion Date.  Prior to such applicable Cash Acquisition Conversion Date, shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to the Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
In the event that a Cash Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock representing less than all the shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock held by a Holder, upon such Cash Acquisition Conversion the Corporation shall execute and the Registrar shall countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation, a certificate evidencing the shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as to which Cash Acquisition Conversion was not effected.
 
The Corporation shall deliver the shares of Common Stock and the amount of cash to which the Holder converting pursuant to Section 10 is entitled on or prior to the third Trading Day immediately following the Cash Acquisition Conversion Date.
 
(d)           In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock should be registered or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder as shown on the records of the Corporation and to send the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock to the address of such Holder shown on the records of the Corporation.
 
(e)           Shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding on the applicable Conversion Date, subject to the right of Holders of such shares to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and other amounts and shares of Common Stock, if any, to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 8, 9 or 10, as applicable.
 
(12)         . (a)  The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury of the Corporation, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as herein provided, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding. For purposes of this Section 12(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by a single Holder.
Reservation of Common Stock
 
(b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock reacquired and held in the treasury of the Corporation (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such treasury shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
 
(c)           All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders).
 
 
 
(d)           Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any governmental authority.
 
(e)           The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation shall, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock; , that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon first conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.
provided, however
 
(13)         . (a)  No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.
Fractional Shares
 
(b)           In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8 or a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to Section 9 or Section 10, the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of:
 
(i)            in the case of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8 or a Cash Acquisition Conversion pursuant to Section 10, the average of the Closing Prices over the five consecutive Trading Day period preceding the Trading Day immediately preceding the Mandatory Conversion Date or Cash Acquisition Conversion Date, as applicable; or
 
(ii)           in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 9, the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the Early Conversion Date.
 
(c)           If more than one share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered.
 
(14)         . (a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be subject to the following adjustments:
Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates
 
(i)            . If the Corporation issues Common Stock to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution will be divided by a fraction:
Stock Dividends and Distributions
 
(A)          the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination, and
 
(B)           the denominator of which is the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) will become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to make such dividend or distribution, to such Fixed Conversion Rate
 
 
 
that would be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.   For the purposes of this clause (i), the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination shall not include shares held in treasury by the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Corporation.
 
(ii)           . If the Corporation issues to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock rights or warrants (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans), entitling such holders, for a period of up to 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such rights or warrants will be increased by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction:
Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights
 
(A)          the numerator of which is the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants, and
 
(B)           the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination and the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of the aggregate offering price payable to exercise such rights or warrants divided by the Current Market Price.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) will become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination. In the event that such rights or warrants described in this clause (ii) are not so issued, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights or warrants, to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared. To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In determining the aggregate offering price payable to exercise such rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration (if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof), whose determination shall be conclusive).  For the purposes of this clause (ii), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in treasury by the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Corporation.
 
(iii)          . If outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combined into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date of such subdivision or combination shall be multiplied by a fraction:
Subdivisions and Combinations of the Common Stock
 
(A)          the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after, and solely as a result of, such subdivision or combination, and
 
(B)           the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iii) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date of such subdivision or combination.
 
 
 
(iv)          . (A)  If the Corporation distributes to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets (excluding (1) any dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(a)(i), (2) any rights or warrants covered by Section 14(a)(ii), (3) any dividend or distribution covered by Section 14(a)(v) and (4) any Spin-Off to which the provisions set forth in Section 14(a)(iv)(B) apply), each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution will be multiplied by a fraction:
Debt or Asset Distribution
 
1.             the numerator of which is the Current Market Price, and
 
2.             the denominator of which is the Current Market Price minus the Fair Market Value, on such date fixed for determination, of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock.
 
(B)           In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution will be multiplied by a fraction:
 
1.             the numerator of which is the sum of (x) the Current Market Price and (y) the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed which is applicable to one share of Common Stock as of the fifteenth Trading Day after the Ex-Date for such distribution (or, if such shares of capital stock or equity interests are listed on a national or regional securities exchange, the average of the Closing Prices of such securities for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on such fifteenth Trading Day), and
 
2.             the denominator of which is the Current Market Price.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iv) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution. In the event that such distribution described in this clause (iv) is not so made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. If an adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate is required under this clause (iv) during any settlement period in respect of shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock that have been tendered for conversion, delivery of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion will be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this clause (iv).
 
(v)           .  If the Corporation distributes an amount exclusively in cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (excluding (1) any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 14(e) applies, (2) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or (3) any consideration payable in as part of a tender or exchange offer by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation), each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution will be multiplied by a fraction:
Cash Distributions
 
(A)          the numerator of which is the Current Market Price, and
 
(B)           the denominator of which is the Current Market Price minus the amount per share of Common Stock of such distribution.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (v) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution. In the event that any distribution described in this clause (v) is not so made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be
 
 
readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such distribution, to such Fixed Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
 
(vi)          . If the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation successfully completes a tender or exchange offer pursuant to a Schedule TO or registration statement on Form S-4 for Common Stock (excluding any securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock), where the cash and the value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Current Market Price, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of expiration of the tender or exchange offer (the "") will be multiplied by a fraction:
Self Tender Offers and Exchange Offers
Expiration Date
 
(A)          the numerator of which shall be equal to the sum of:
 
a.             the aggregate cash and Fair Market Value on the Expiration Date of any other consideration paid or payable for shares of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date; and
 
b.             the product of the Current Market Price and the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the last time tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "") on the Expiration Date; and
Expiration Time
 
(B)           the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of the Current Market Price ; and the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Expiration Time on the Expiration Date.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (vi) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the seventh Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date. In the event that the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each Fixed Conversation Rate shall be readjusted to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this clause (vi) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in each Fixed Conversation Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this clause (vi).  If an adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this clause (vi) during any settlement period in respect of shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock that have been tendered for conversion, delivery of the related conversion consideration will be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this clause (vi).
 
(vii)         Except with respect to a Spin-Off, in cases where the Fair Market Value of assets (including cash), debt securities or certain rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Corporation as to which Section 14(a)(iv) or Section 14(a)(v) apply, applicable to one share of Common Stock, distributed to holders of Common Stock equals or exceeds the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the five consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day before the Ex-Date for such distribution, rather than being entitled to an adjustment in each Fixed Conversion Rate, Holders shall be entitled to receive upon conversion, in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the applicable conversion rate in effect on the applicable Conversion Date, the kind and amount of assets (including cash), debt securities or rights, warrants or options comprising the distribution that such Holder would have received if such Holder had converted its shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution calculated by multiplying the kind and amount of assets (including cash), debt securities or rights, warrants or options comprising such distribution by the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Minimum Conversion Rate in effect on the applicable Conversion Date.
 
(viii)        . To the extent that the Corporation has a rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to
Rights Plans
 
 
such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation of such rights as if the Corporation made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in Section 14(a)(iv), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
 
(b)           . The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 14, as the Corporation deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
Adjustment for Tax Reasons
provided
 
(c). (i) All adjustments to each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock. Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, no adjustment in a Fixed Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; , that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 14(c)(i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; that with respect to adjustments to be made to the Fixed Conversion Rates in connection with cash dividends paid by the Corporation, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be adjusted regardless of whether such aggregate adjustments amount to one percent or more of the Fixed Conversion Rates no later than March 15 of each calendar year; that on the earlier of the Mandatory Conversion Date, an Early Conversion Date and the Effective Date of a Cash Acquisition, adjustments to each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not been taken into account before such date.
           Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price and Stock Price
provided
provided, however
provided, further
 
(ii)           If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Sections 14(a) or 14(b), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 8(b) shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be either Fixed Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to Sections 14(a) or 14(b) and the denominator of which shall be such Fixed Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment.  The Corporation shall make appropriate adjustments to the Closing Prices prior to the relevant Ex-Date, effective date or Expiration Date, as the case may be, used to calculate the Applicable Market Value to account for any adjustments to the Initial Price, the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Fixed Conversion Rates that become effective during the 20 consecutive Trading Day period used for calculating the Applicable Market Value.
 
(iii)          If:
 
(A)          the record date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs after the end of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period used for calculating the Applicable Market Value and before the Mandatory Conversion Date; and
 
(B)           such dividend or distribution would have resulted in an adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holders had such record date occurred on or before the last Trading Day of such 20-Trading Day period,
 
then the Corporation shall deem the Holders to be holders of record of Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In this case, the Holders would receive the dividend or distribution on Common Stock together with the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the Mandatory Conversion Date.
 
(iv)          If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Sections 14(a) or 14(b), a proportional adjustment shall be made to each Stock Price column heading set forth in the table included in the definition of "Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate." Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying each Stock Price included in such table by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment.
 
 
(v)           No adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment.  In addition, the applicable Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
 
(A)          upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
 
(B)           upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
 
(C)           upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the Issue Date; or
 
(D)          for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.
