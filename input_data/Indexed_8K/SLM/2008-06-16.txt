Indemnification and Contribution
 
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, its directors and officers, and any person controlling such Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information relating to the Notes, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred, the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such document or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agents expressly for use therein as set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement or in some other manner.
(a)
          
provided
 
Each Agent, on a several and not joint basis, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information relating to the Notes, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any such documents or such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein as set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement or in some other manner; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
(b)
          
the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  The consent in this last sentence shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and the indemnifying party agrees that the indemnified party shall in all cases be justified in withholding consent unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(c)
          
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other, from the offering of the Notes to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 6(c), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and each Agent, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as
(d)
          
well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent from the Company in respect thereof.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand or by any Agent, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by or through such Agent were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of each of the Agents under this Section 6(d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
(e)
          
 
.  The Company, without the consent of the Agents, may appoint additional firms or corporations to become Agents hereunder (each an "") within the meaning of this Agreement upon the execution by the Company and each such Additional Agent of an agreement to the effect that such Additional Agent shall have all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of an Agent hereunder.  If mutually agreed to by the Company and an Additional Agent in such agreement pursuant to this Section 7, the Company shall deliver (i) a letter addressed to such Additional Agent entitling such Additional Agent to the benefits of a prior opinion letter delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 5(d) as of the date of such prior opinion letter and (ii) a letter addressed to such Additional Agent entitling such Additional Agent to the benefits of the Company officer's certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f) as of the date of such prior certificate, and the Company

.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, as the case may be, will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or statement as to the results thereof made by or on behalf of any Agent, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.

Termination
 
This Agreement may be terminated at any time either by the Company as to any Agent or, in the case of any Agent, by such Agent upon the giving of written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto.  In the event of such termination, no party shall have any liability to the other parties hereto, except as provided herein and except that, if at the time of termination an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the Settlement Date in respect of such Notes has not occurred, the Company's obligations provided herein shall not be terminated in respect of such Notes.  In the case of purchases pursuant to Section 3.3, the Company's obligations pursuant to Section 4 shall not be terminated so long as any Agent continues to hold the Note or Notes as principal for its own account or for resale to others.
(a)
          
 
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of termination of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement with respect to any Agent, such Agent shall not receive any compensation except in connection with a purchase or solicitation by it of Notes actually consummated, the foregoing shall in no way limit the indemnification and contribution provisions of Section 6, or an Agent's right to reimbursement by the Company for out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred by such Agent and to which such Agent is otherwise entitled as provided herein.
(b)
          
provided
 
If this Agreement or any Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 or for any other reason, (a) the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4(h) to the extent actually incurred by or committed to prior to the date of such termination, (b) the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) shall remain in effect until the settlement of all pending deliveries of and payment for securities, and (c) the respective indemnification and contribution obligations of the Company and the Agents pursuant to Section 6 and the obligations of the Company to provide earnings statements pursuant to Section 4(c) shall remain in effect.

Transaction Documents
 
I am admitted to the bar in the State of Maryland, and I do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction, except to the extent expressly referred to in this opinion letter, the federal laws of the United States of America and with respect to the opinions referred to in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vi) below, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. For purposes of this opinion, with your permission, I have assumed that the laws of
the State of New York are not materially different than the laws of the State of Maryland with respect to the matters herein.  For purposes of the opinion referred to in paragraph (xii) regarding U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, I have relied upon the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP dated as of the date hereof.

With respect to paragraph (ix) below, I express no opinion as to the requirements of the federal or state securities laws except that (i) the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""), (ii) the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the ""), (iii) the Approved Issuer Free-Writing Prospectus and the Approved Term Sheet have been filed with the Commission or retained by the Company in accordance with Rule 433 under the Securities Act and (iv) the Program Prospectus and the Pricing Supplement have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.

Exchange Act
 
(x)
           
To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;

(xv)  The Registration Statement and the Prospectus in as much as those documents relate to the Purchased Notes (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; although I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, except for those referred to in the opinion in items (v), (vii) and (xii) above, I have no reason to believe that (1) as of its applicable effective date, the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (2) as of the date of the most recent Prospectus Supplement and as of the date of this opinion letter, the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or (3) as of the Time of Sale (as defined in the Terms Agreement), the Time of Sale Information (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and I do not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or which has not been filed as required; and
 
(xvi) To my knowledge, there is no contract or other document to which the Company is a party required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or required to be described in the Prospectus which has not been so filed, incorporated by reference or described as required.
