July 22, 2008 To the Agents listed on the signature page hereto.
 
SLM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell an unlimited aggregate principal amount of its Medium Term Notes, Series B, also known as EdNotes due nine months or more from date of issue (the "Notes").  The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of October 1, 2000 (the "Original Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Original Trustee"), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 16, 2003 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as consented to by the Original Trustee, as amended by the Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 17, 2004 (the "Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee, and as further amended by the Second Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 22, 2008 (the "Second Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee (the Original Indenture collectively with the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Second Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture, each as amended or supplemented, the "Indenture").  The terms of the Notes are described in the Prospectus referred to below.  The Notes will be issued, and the terms thereof established, from time to time by the Company in accordance with the Indenture.
 
Certain of the parties to this Amended and Restated Selling Agent Agreement (the "Agreement") originally entered into a Selling Agent Agreement, dated January 23, 2003, as amended and restated on January 5, 2005, and now wish to amend and restate such agreement as provided herein.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the Company hereby (i) appoints each of you as agent of the Company ("Agent") for the purpose of soliciting offers to purchase the Notes, and each of you hereby agree to use your reasonable best efforts to solicit and receive offers to purchase Notes upon terms acceptable to the Company at such times and in such amounts as the Company shall from time to time specify and in accordance with the terms hereof and after consultation with Incapital LLC (the "Purchasing Agent") and (ii) agrees that whenever the Company determines to sell Notes pursuant to this Agreement, such Notes shall be sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement (as defined herein) relating to such sale in accordance with the provisions of Section IV hereof between the Company and the Purchasing Agent, with the Purchasing Agent purchasing such Notes as principal for resale to other Agents or dealers (the "Selected Dealers"), each of whom will purchase as principal.  The Company reserves the right to enter into agreements substantially identical hereto with other agents.  This Agreement shall not be construed to create either an obligation on the part of the Company to sell any Notes or an obligation of any of the Agents to purchase Notes.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") an automatic registration statement, as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") on Form S-3 (File No. 333- 130584) relating to the Notes and the offering thereof in accordance with Rule 415 under the 1933 Act not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof.  Such registration statement, any further registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering Notes and the prospectus relating to the offer and sale of the Company's debt securities constituting a part thereof, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated July 22, 2008 (which relates to the registration statement in accordance with Rule 429 promulgated under the 1933 Act) relating to the Notes, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented, including any Pricing Supplement (as defined herein) are referred to collectively herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus," respectively.  Any supplement to the Prospectus that sets forth only the terms of a particular issue of the Notes is referred to herein as a "Pricing Supplement."  The Registration Statement has become effective, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act").  All references in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing, shall include any copy thereof filed with the SEC pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR").
 
The obligations of the Agents hereunder shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of (i) the date hereof, (ii) each Representation Date, as defined below, and (iii) the date of any Terms Agreement, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
 
No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended from time to time, shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened by the SEC.

"Final Term Sheet" means a term sheet with respect to the final terms of the Notes that the Company and the Agents have agreed to, prior to the use thereof, in writing, electronically or otherwise, in the form filed or required to be filed with the SEC, as amended or supplemented prior to the Initial Sale Time of the applicable Notes.

There shall not have come to the attention of the Purchasing Agent or any Agent purchasing Notes as principal, any facts that would cause such Agent to believe that the Disclosure Package, including any Agent Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus (as defined below), at the Initial Sale Time with respect to the Notes to be issued, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.

II.
 
In further consideration of your agreements herein contained, the Company covenants as follows:
 
The Company will notify the Agents immediately of (i) the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) the filing of any supplement to the Prospectus (including any Company Free Writing Prospectus), (iii) the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package (other than with respect to a document filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus), (iv) any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Registration Statement, any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or for additional information relating thereto (other than such a request with respect to a document filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus), and (v) the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose or any part thereof or any notice of objection of the SEC to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g) under the 1933 Act.  The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to promptly obtain the lifting thereof.
(a)
                                 
 
The Company will give the Agents notice of its intention to file or prepare any additional registration statement with respect to the registration of additional Notes or any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package (other than an amendment or supplement providing solely for a change in the interest rates or maturity dates of Notes or similar changes or an amendment or supplement effected by the filing of a document with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act) and, upon request, will furnish the Agents with copies of any such registration statement or amendment or supplement proposed to be filed or prepared a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or preparation, as the case may be, and will not file any such registration statement or amendment or supplement in a form as to which the Agents reasonably object.  If required by Rule 430B(h) under the 1933 Act, the Company shall prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by the Purchasing Agent and will file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act not later than may be required by Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act; and the Company shall make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved by the Purchasing Agent promptly after reasonable notice thereof.
(b)
                                
 
The Company will furnish to the Agents as many copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) or any Company Free Writing Prospectus as the Agents shall reasonably request so long as the Agents are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales or solicitations of offers to purchase the Notes under the 1933 Act.
(c)
                                 
 
The Company will prepare, with respect to any Notes to be sold through or to an Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a Pricing Supplement with respect to such Notes in the form attached as Exhibit C or in such other form previously agreed upon by the Purchasing Agent and the Company and will file such Pricing Supplement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act within the time period required by such rule.  If an Agent has advised the Company that such Agent is relying, in connection with any offering of Notes, upon the exemption from Section 5(b) of the 1933 Act set forth in Rule 172 under the 1933 Act, and the Company is unable to file the applicable Pricing Supplement within the time period specified in the previous sentence, the Company shall file such Pricing Supplement as soon as practicable thereafter, as contemplated by Rule 172(c)(3).  If a preliminary Pricing Supplement is prepared with respect to any Notes, the Company will file such preliminary Pricing Supplement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act within the time period required by such rule.
(d)
                                
 
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (n) of this Section, if at any time during the term of this Agreement any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Company, to further amend or supplement the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package in order that the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances existing at the time such statements were made, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of such counsel, to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, immediate notice shall be given, and confirmed in writing, to each Agent to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in the Agent's capacity as agent (and, if so notified, such Agent shall promptly cease such solicitation) and to cease sales of any Notes the Agent may then own as principal, and the Company will promptly prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act or otherwise (including, if consented to by the Agents, by means of a Company Free Writing Prospectus), as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package comply with such requirements.
(e)
                                 
 
(i)  The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Purchasing Agent, and each Agent represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company and the Purchasing Agent, it will not make, any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute a Company Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act, required to be filed with the SEC.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Purchasing Agent is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."  Unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the applicable Agents, the Company (A) has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as a Company Free Writing Prospectus, and (B) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the
(f)
                                   
 
requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the 1933 Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the SEC, legending and record keeping.  The Company consents to the use by any Agent of a free writing prospectus that contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Notes or their offering.  The prior sentence shall not limit any of the Company's obligations under paragraph (e) above.
 
(ii)  The Company and each Agent acknowledge that the parties hereto may formulate from time to time written policies governing free writing prospectuses that vary and differ from the provisions of this Section II(f).  Such written policies may be applicable to one or more issuances of Notes, and may relate to, without limitation, (A) the obligations of the Company and the Agents for filing free writing prospectuses with the SEC, (B) procedures for the preparation, review and use of free writing prospectuses, (C) the Agent's preparation and distribution of free writing prospectuses that are not subject to the filing requirements of Rule 433(d)(1)(ii) (an "Agent Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus"), (D) whether the use of any free writing prospectus shall be conditioned upon the delivery of a legal opinion from counsel to the Company and/or the Agents and (E) any other related matters as the Company may agree from time to time with one or more of the Agents.
 
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (n) of this Section, on or prior to the date on which there shall be released to the general public interim financial statement information related to the Company with respect to each of the first three quarters of any fiscal year or preliminary financial statement information with respect to any fiscal year, the Company shall promptly cause the Prospectus to be amended or supplemented to include or incorporate by reference financial information with respect thereto, as well as such other information and explanations as shall be necessary for an understanding thereof, as may be required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act or otherwise.
(g)
                                
 
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (n) of this Section, on or prior to the date on which there shall be released to the general public financial information included in or derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the preceding fiscal year, the Company shall promptly cause the Registration Statement and the Prospectus to be amended to include or incorporate by reference such audited financial statements and the report or reports, and consent or consents to such inclusion or incorporation by reference, of the independent accountants with respect thereto, as well as such other information and explanations as shall be necessary for an understanding of such financial statements, as may be required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act or otherwise.
(h)
                                
 
The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Section 11(a) and of Rule 158 under the 1933 Act) covering each twelve-month period beginning, in each case, not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration Statement with respect to each sale of Notes.
(i)
                                    
 
The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Agents, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Agents may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Notes; , , that the
(j)
                                    
provided
however
 
Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified.  The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been qualified as above provided.  The Company will promptly advise the Agents of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
 
The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.
(k)
                                 
 
(i) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts, in cooperation with the Purchasing Agent, to cause such Notes as the Company and the Purchasing Agent agree to be accepted for listing on any stock exchange (each, a "Stock Exchange"), in each case as the Company and the Purchasing Agent shall deem to be appropriate. In connection with any such agreement to qualify Notes for listing on a Stock Exchange, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such listing promptly and shall furnish any and all documents, instruments, information and undertakings that may be necessary or advisable in order to obtain and maintain the listing.
(l)
                                    
 
(ii) So long as any Note remains outstanding and listed on a Stock Exchange, if either (A) there is a significant change affecting any matter described in the Prospectus the inclusion of which was required by applicable law, the listing rules and regulations of such Stock Exchange on which any Notes are listed (the "Listing Rules"), or by such Stock Exchange or (B) a significant new matter arises the inclusion of information with respect to which would have been so required if it had arisen when the Prospectus was prepared, to provide to the Purchasing Agent information about the change or matter, publish such supplementary Prospectus as may be required by such Stock Exchange and otherwise comply with applicable law and the Listing Rules in that regard.
 
(iii) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to comply with any undertakings given by it from time to time to any Stock Exchange on which any Notes are listed.
 
The Company will notify the Purchasing Agent as soon as practicable, and confirm such notice in writing, of any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as such term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) under the 1933 Act, to the Medium-Term Note Program under which the Notes are issued (the "Program") or any debt securities (including the Notes) of the Company, or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of the Program or any debt securities of the Company (including the Notes), or the withdrawal by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization of its rating of the Program or any debt securities of the Company (including the Notes). The Purchasing Agent will, in turn, notify promptly the other Agents of any such change.
(m)
                              
 
The Company shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subsections(d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or (j) of this Section or the provisions of Sections VI(b) and (c) during any
(n)
                                
 
period from the time (i) the Agents have suspended solicitation of purchases of the Notes in their capacity as agent pursuant to a request from the Company and (ii) the Agents shall not then hold any Notes as principal purchased from the Purchasing Agent to the time the Company shall determine that solicitation of purchases of the Notes should be resumed or shall subsequently agree for the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal.
 
III.
 
The Agents propose to solicit offers to purchase the Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Prospectus and upon the terms communicated to the Agents from time to time by the Company or the Purchasing Agent, as the case may be.  For the purpose of such solicitation, the Agents will use the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (together with any preliminary Pricing Supplement for a series of Notes or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, as applicable) which has been most recently distributed to the Agents by the Company, and the Agents will solicit offers to purchase only as permitted or contemplated thereby and herein and will solicit offers to purchase the Notes only as permitted by the 1933 Act and the applicable securities laws or regulations of any jurisdiction.  The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently.  Upon receipt of instructions (which may be given orally) from the Company, the Agents will promptly suspend solicitation of offers to purchase until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.
(a)
                                 
 
Unless otherwise instructed by the Company or specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, Pricing Supplement or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Agents are authorized to solicit offers to purchase the Notes only in denominations of $1,000 or more (in multiples of $1,000).  The Agents are not authorized to appoint subagents or to engage the services of any other broker or dealer in connection with the offer or sale of the Notes without the prior written consent of the Company.  Unless otherwise instructed by the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes.  The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Notes and may reject any proposed offers to purchase Notes as a whole or in part.  Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein.  The Company agrees to pay the Purchasing Agent, as consideration for soliciting offers to purchase Notes pursuant to a Terms Agreement, a concession in the form of a discount equal to the percentages of the initial offering price of each Note actually sold as agreed between the Company and the Purchasing Agent (the "Concession").  The actual aggregate Concession with respect to each tranche of Notes will be set forth in the related Pricing Supplement.  The Purchasing Agent and the other Agents or Selected Dealers will share the above-mentioned Concession in such proportions as they may agree.
 
All Notes shall be sold to the public at the purchase price authorized by the Company.  Such purchase price shall be set forth in the confirmation statement of the Agent or Selected Dealer responsible for such sale and delivered to the purchaser along with a copy of the Prospectus (if not previously delivered) and Pricing Supplement.
 
Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of, and the solicitation of purchases and payment for, the Notes are set forth in the Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Procedures"), as amended from time to time.  Unless otherwise provided in a Terms Agreement, the provisions of the Procedures shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder.  The Agents and the Company each agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each in the Procedures as amended from time to time.

The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.  The Company agrees to pay the required SEC filing fees relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).

Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section VII for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel), approved by the Agents in the case of paragraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
 
(d)           To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section VII is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion so that each Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent bears to the total sales price from the sale of Notes sold to or through the Agents to the date of such liability, and the Company is responsible for the balance.  However, if the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or such Agent, the parties' relative intents, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances.  The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this paragraph (d).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no case shall an Agent be responsible for any amount in excess of the commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent in connection with the Notes from which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses
 
arise and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section VII, each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of the 1933 Act and each Agent's or controlling person's officers and directors shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
 
(e)
                                 
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section VII shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any termination of this Agreement; (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents; (iii) any investigation by an indemnified party or on such party's behalf or any person controlling an indemnified party or by or on behalf of the indemnifying party, its directors or officers or any person controlling the indemnifying party; and (iv) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
 
VIII.
 
The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Notes under this Agreement at any time; the Company also (as to any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as to itself) may terminate the appointment and arrangements described in this Agreement.  Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall suspend or terminate the participation of any Selected Dealer under the Master Selected Dealer Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit D.  Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to all of the Agents and by giving not less than 5 days written notice of termination to the affected party and the other parties to this Agreement, or in the case of an Agent, by giving not less than 5 days written notice of termination to the Company and except that, if at the time of termination an offer for the purchase of Notes shall have been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto shall not yet have occurred, the Company shall have the obligations provided herein with respect to such Note or Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any such termination.
 
The Purchasing Agent may, and, upon the request of an Agent with respect to any Notes being purchased by such Agent, shall, terminate any agreement hereunder by the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes, immediately upon notice to the Company at any time prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if (i) there has been, since the date of such agreement, any Material Adverse Change the effect of which is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent, impracticable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, (ii) since the date of such agreement, trading in any
securities of the Company has been suspended by the SEC or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the SEC or any other governmental authority, (iii) a material disruption in the commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred or a banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis (in the United States or elsewhere) the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent, impracticable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, (v) since the date of such agreement (x) a downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the SEC for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the 1933 Act, or (y) any such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or (vi) there shall have come to the attention of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent or Agents any facts that would cause them to believe that the Disclosure Package at the Initial Sale Time included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made or existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.
 
Any Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination in your absolute discretion on the terms set forth or incorporated by reference therein.  The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement is terminated, Section VII and Section XI hereof shall survive and shall remain in effect; provided that if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the Purchasing Agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of all of Section II, Section III(b) and Section IV shall also survive until time of delivery.
 
In the event a proposed offering is not completed according to the terms of this Agreement, an Agent will be reimbursed by the Company only for out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred by such Agent, and the Company shall remain responsible for such other expenses set forth in Section XII.

(viii)        The issue and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture and the Selling Agent Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated do not and will not (a) conflict with or result in any breach that would constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, loan agreement or other material agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any property or assets of the Company, is subject, (b) result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws
 
 
of the Company or (c) to the best of my knowledge, result in any violation of any statute or any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Company of any court or any Federal, State or other regulatory authority or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company and any of its properties;

Exchange Act
 
(x)            To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
 
(xi)
          
The Company is not in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound;
 
(xii)
         
The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of EdNotes," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Supplemental Plan of Distribution" as they relate to the Notes and insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such laws and documents, and the statements under the caption "United States Federal Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws referred to therein, constitute a fair and accurate summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes;
 
(xiii)
        
The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes, will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
 
(xiv)
       
The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus inasmuch as those documents relate to the Notes (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable,
 
 
and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and I have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
 
(xv)
        
The Registration Statement and the Prospectus in as much as those documents relate to the Notes (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; although I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinion in items (v), (vii) and (xii) above, I have no reason to believe that, (i) as of its applicable effective date, the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date of this opinion letter, the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which I express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and I do not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed which has not been filed as required; and
 
(xvi)
       
To my knowledge, there is no contract or other document to which the Company is a party required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or required to be described in the Prospectus, which has not been so filed, incorporated by reference or described as required.
 
 
Schedule B
 
Form of Opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
July 22, 2008
 
Although the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "United States Federal Tax Consequences" is general in nature and does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences that could apply to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of Notes, to the extent such discussion constitutes statements of United States federal income tax law or conclusions with respect thereto, such discussion is, under current United States federal income tax law, in all material respects, fair and accurate.
 
 
Schedule C
 
Form of Opinion of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP
July 22, 2008

5.     The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.  To our knowledge, based upon telephonic confirmation from the Commission, the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the ""), and constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium, receivership or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

EXHIBIT A
 
SLM CORPORATION
 
EDNOTES
 
DUE NINE MONTHS OR MORE FROM DATE OF ISSUE
 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
 
EdNotes, due from nine months or more from date of issue, are offered on a continuing basis by SLM Corporation. The Notes will be offered by Incapital LLC (the "Purchasing Agent") and Banc of America Securities LLC, Charles Schwab & Co. Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
Fidelity Capital Markets Services, a division of National Financial Services LLC,
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets Corporation, UBS Securities LLC and Wachovia Securities, LLC (collectively, the "Agents"), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Selling Agent Agreement among the Company and the Agents dated July 22 (the "Selling Agent Agreement") and one or more terms agreements substantially in one of the forms attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit B or such other form as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Purchasing Agent (each a "Terms Agreement").  The Notes are being resold by the Purchasing Agent (and by any Agent that purchases them from the Purchasing Agent) (i) directly to customers of the Agents or (ii) to selected broker-dealers (the "Selected Dealers") for distribution to their customers pursuant to a Master Selected Dealer Agreement (a "Dealers Agreement") attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit D.  The Agents have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to solicit purchases of the Notes.  The Notes will be senior debt and have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of October 1, 2000 (the "Original Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Original Trustee"), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 16, 2003 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as consented to by the Original Trustee, as amended by the Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 17, 2004 (the "Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee, and as further amended by the Second Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 22, 2008 (the "Second Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee (the Original Indenture collectively with the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Second Amended Fourth Supplemental Indenture, each as amended or supplemented, the "Indenture").

Owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be entitled to physical delivery of Notes issued in certificated form equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial interests only upon certain limited circumstances described in the applicable Indenture.
 
Administrative procedures and specific terms of the offering are explained below. Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be handled for the Company by its Treasury Department.  The Company will advise the Agents and the Trustee in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agents and the Trustee are to communicate regarding offers to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery.

Dear    .
:
 
In connection with public offerings of securities after the date hereof for which we are acting as lead agent, as lead or co-manager of an underwriting syndicate or otherwise involved in the distribution of securities by means of an offering of securities for sale to selected dealers, you may be offered the right as a selected dealer to purchase as principal a portion of such securities.
 
This will confirm our mutual agreement as to the general terms and conditions applicable to your participation in any such selected dealer group organized by us as follows.
 
1.             .  The terms and conditions of this letter agreement (this "Agreement") shall be applicable to any public offering of securities ("Securities"), effected pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in respect of which Incapital LLC ("Incapital"), clearing through RBC Dain Correspondent Services  (the "Account") (acting for its own Account or for the account of any underwriting or agent or similar group or syndicate), is responsible for managing or otherwise implementing the sale (whether by acting as lead agent or manager or by facilitating the re-offer of Securities or otherwise) of the Securities to selected dealers ("Selected Dealers") and has expressly informed you that these terms and conditions shall be applicable.  Any such offering of Securities to you as a Selected Dealer is hereinafter called an "Offering."  In the case of any Offering where we are acting for the account of any underwriting or agent or similar group or syndicate (whether purchasing as principal for resale or soliciting as agent purchases of Securities directly from the issuer) ("Underwriters"), the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, and binding upon, such Underwriters, including, in the case of any Offering where we are acting with others as representatives of Underwriters, such other representatives.  The use of the defined term Underwriter herein shall be understood to include acting as agent.
Applicability of this Agreement
 
2.             .  Any Offering:  (i) will be subject to delivery of the Securities and their acceptance by us and any other Underwriters; (ii) may be subject to the approval of all legal matters by counsel and the satisfaction of other closing conditions, and (iii) may be made on the basis of reservation of Securities or an allotment against subscription.  We will advise you by electronic mail, facsimile or other form of Written Communication (as defined below) of the particular method and supplementary terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the information as to prices and offering date referred to in Section 3(c) hereof) of any Offering in which you are invited to participate.  "Written Communication" may include, in the case of any Offering described in Section 3(a) hereof, Additional Information (as defined below).  You agree that if we make electronic delivery of a prospectus or any supplement thereto, we have satisfied our obligation, if any, pursuant to Section 3 hereof to deliver to you a prospectus or any supplement thereto.  To the extent such supplementary terms and conditions are inconsistent with any provision herein, such terms and conditions shall supersede any such provision.  Unless otherwise indicated in any such Written
Conditions of Offering; Acceptance and Purchases
 
Communication, acceptances and other communications by you with respect to an Offering should be sent to Incapital LLC, 200 South Wacker Drive, Suite 3700, Chicago, Illinois 60606 (Fax: (312) 379-3701).  We reserve the right to reject any acceptance in whole or in part.  Unless notified otherwise by us, Securities purchased by you shall be paid for on such date as we shall determine, on one day's prior notice to you, by electronic transfer in an amount equal to the Public Offering Price (as hereinafter defined) or, if we shall so advise you, at such Public Offering Price less the Concession (as hereinafter defined), payable in Federal funds to the order of RBC Dain Correspondent Services clearing for the account of Incapital LLC, against delivery of the Securities.  If Securities are purchased and paid for at such Public Offering Price, such Concession will be paid after the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to such Securities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless notified otherwise by us, payment for and delivery of Securities purchased by you shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, if you are a member, unless you have otherwise notified us prior to the date specified in a Written Communication to you from us or, if you are not a member, settlement may be made through a correspondent who is a member pursuant to instructions which you will send to us prior to such specified date.

Offering Materials and Arrangements
 
(a)           .  In the case of any Offering of Securities that are registered under the Securities Act ("Registered Offering"), the following terms shall have the following meanings.  The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means any preliminary prospectus relating to the Offering or any preliminary prospectus supplement together with a prospectus relating to the Offering.  The term "Prospectus" means the prospectus, together with the final prospectus supplement, if any, relating to the Offering filed or to be filed under Rule 424 of the Securities Act.  The term "free writing prospectus" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and the term "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus" means (i) a free writing prospectus authorized for use by us and SLM Corporation (the "Issuer") in connection with the Offering of the Securities that has been or will be filed with the Commission (as defined) in accordance with Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act or (ii) a free writing prospectus containing solely a description of terms of the Securities that (a) does not reflect the final terms, (b) is exempt from the filing requirement pursuant to Rule 433(d)(5)(i) and (c) is furnished to you for use by Incapital LLC.  "Additional Information" means the Preliminary Prospectus together with each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, if any, delivered to you relating to the Offering of Securities.  In connection with any Registered Offering, we will provide to you electronically copies of the Additional Information and of the Prospectus (other than, in each case, information incorporated by reference therein) for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission) thereunder and will make available to you such number of copies of the Prospectus as you may reasonably request as soon as practicable after sufficient copies are made available to us by the issuer of the Securities.
Registered Offerings
 
You agree that you will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of any written communication (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) concerning the Offering, any issuer of the Securities (including, without limitation, any free writing prospectus and any information furnished by us and any issuer of Securities but not
 
incorporated by reference into the Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus), other than (a) any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus or (b) any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.
 
You represent and warrant that you are familiar with the rules relating to the distribution of a Preliminary Prospectus and agree that you will comply therewith.  You represent and warrant that you are familiar with Rule 173 under the Securities Act relating to electronic delivery.  You agree to make a record of your distribution of each Preliminary Prospectus and, when furnished with copies of any revised Preliminary Prospectus, you will, upon our request, promptly forward copies thereof to each person to whom you have theretofore distributed a Preliminary Prospectus.
 
You agree that in purchasing Securities in a Registered Offering you will rely upon no statement whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the Preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus delivered to you by us.  You will not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to a prospectus or by any Underwriter to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the prospectus in connection with the sale of such Securities.  You agree that you have not relied, and will not rely, upon advice from us regarding the suitability of any Securities as an investment for you or your clients.  You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to ensure that, prior to any distribution, the Securities are suitable for your clients, it is lawful for your clients to purchase the Securities and the clients are capable of evaluating and have evaluated the risks and merits of an investment in the Securities.  You agree not to market the Securities in any manner which is inconsistent with or not on the basis of the materials furnished to you for use in the distribution and you agree not to use marketing materials other than those that have been approved for use.
 
(b)           .  With respect to any Offering of Securities, we will inform you by a Written Communication of the public offering price, the selling concession, the reallowance (if any) to dealers and the time when you may commence selling Securities to the public.  After such public offering has commenced, we may change the public offering price, the selling concession and the reallowance to dealers.  The offering price, selling concession and reallowance (if any) to dealers at any time in effect with respect to an Offering are hereinafter referred to, respectively, as the "Public Offering Price", the "Concession" and the "Reallowance."  With respect to each Offering of Securities, until the provisions of this Section 3(c) shall be terminated pursuant to Section 5 hereof, you agree to offer Securities to the public at no more than the Public Offering Price.  If so notified by us, you may sell Securities to the public at a lesser negotiated price than the Public Offering Price, but in an amount not to exceed the "Concession."  If a Reallowance is in effect, a reallowance from the Public Offering Price not in excess of such Reallowance may be allowed as consideration for services rendered in distribution to dealers who are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business, who are either (i) members in good standing of the Financial Industry Association ("FINRA") who agree to abide by the applicable rules of FINRA (and its predecessor, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), as applicable) (see Section 4(a) below) or (ii) foreign banks, dealers or institutions not eligible for membership in FINRA who represent to you that they will promptly reoffer such Securities at the Public Offering Price and will abide by the conditions with respect to foreign banks, dealers and institutions set forth in Section 4(a) hereof.
Offer and Sale to the Public
 
(c)           .  We may, with respect to any Offering, be authorized to over-allot in arranging sales to Selected Dealers, to purchase and sell
Over-allotment; Stabilization; Unsold Allotments
Securities for long or short account and to stabilize or maintain the market price of the Securities.  You agree that, upon our request at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering, you will report to us the amount of Securities purchased by you pursuant to such Offering which then remain unsold by you and will, upon our request at any such time, sell to us for  our account or the account of one or more Underwriters such amount of such unsold Securities as we may designate at the Public Offering Price less an amount to be determined by us not in excess of the Concession.  If, prior to the later of (i) the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering or (ii) the covering by us of any short position created by us in connection with such Offering for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters, we purchase or contract to purchase for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters in the open market or otherwise any Securities purchased by you under this Agreement as part of such Offering, you agree to pay us on demand an amount equal to the Concession with respect to such Securities (unless you shall have purchased such Securities pursuant to Section 2 hereof at the Public Offering Price in which case we shall not be obligated to pay such Concession to you pursuant to Section 2 plus transfer taxes and broker's commissions or dealer's mark-up, if any, paid in connection with such purchase or contract to purchase.

Representations, Warranties and Agreements
 
(a)           .  You represent and warrant that you are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business and either a member in good standing of the FINRA or, if you are not such a member, you are a foreign bank, dealer or institution not eligible for membership in the FINRA which agrees to make no sales within the United States, its territories or its possessions or to persons who are citizens thereof or residents therein, and in making other sales to comply with the FINRA's interpretation with respect to free riding and withholding.  You agree to notify us immediately if any of the following happens:  you cease to be authorized or licensed by any authority in any relevant jurisdiction to offer Securities; you change your legal status (for example, from a corporation to a partnership or limited liability company); or you become aware that you may be in violation of any regulations applicable to the distribution of the Securities.  You further represent, by your participation in an Offering, that you have provided to us all documents and other information required to be filed with respect to you, any related person or any person associated with you or any such related person pursuant to the supplementary requirements of the FINRA's interpretation with respect to review of corporate financing as such requirements relate to such Offering.
FINRA
 
You agree that, in connection with any purchase or sale of the Securities wherein a Concession, discount or other allowance is received or granted, (1) you will comply with the provisions of Rule 2740 of the Conduct Rules of the  NASD and (2) if you are a non-FINRA member broker or dealer in a foreign country, you will also comply (a), as though you were a FINRA member, with the provisions of Rules 2730, 2740,  2750, and 2790 thereof and (b) with Rule 2420 thereof as that section applies to a non-FINRA member broker or dealer in a foreign country.
 
You further agree that, in connection with any purchase of securities from us that is not otherwise covered by the terms of this Agreement (whether we are acting as manager, as a member of an underwriting syndicate or a selling group or otherwise), if a selling Concession,
discount or other allowance is granted to you, clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding paragraph will be applicable.
 
You further represent and warrant to us at all times that you have obtained all required licenses and authorizations to legally carry out the activities contemplated by this Agreement in each jurisdiction where you are carrying out such activities.
 
(b)           .  We may buy Securities from or sell Securities to any Underwriter or Selected Dealer and, without consent, the Underwriters (if any) and the Selected Dealers may purchase Securities from and sell Securities to each other at the Public Offering Price less all or any part of the Concession.  Unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement between you and us, this agreement does not authorize you to act as agent for:  (i) us; (ii) any Underwriter; (iii) the Issuer; or (iv) other seller of any Securities in offering Securities to the public or otherwise.  Neither we nor any Underwriter shall be under any obligation to you except for obligations assumed hereby or in any Written Communication from us in connection with any Offering.  Nothing contained herein or in any Written Communication from us shall constitute the Selected Dealers an association or partners with us or any Underwriter or with one another.  If the Selected Dealers, among themselves or with the Underwriters, should be deemed to constitute a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, then you elect to be excluded from the application of Subchapter K, Chapter 1, Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and agree not to take any position inconsistent with that election.  You authorize us, in our discretion, to execute and file on your behalf such evidence of that election as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service.  In connection with any Offering, you shall be liable for your proportionate amount of any tax, claim, demand or liability that may be asserted against you alone or against one or more Selected Dealers participating in such Offering, or against us or the Underwriters, based upon the claim that the Selected Dealers, or any of them, constitute an association, an unincorporated business or other entity, including, in each case, your proportionate amount of any expense incurred in defending against any such tax, claim, demand or liability.
Relationship Among Underwriters and Selected Dealers
 
(c)           .  Incapital is acting as representative of each of the Underwriters in all matters connected with the Offering of the Securities and with the Underwriters' purchases (or solicitation for purchase) of the Securities.  The rights and liabilities of each Underwriter of Securities and each Selected Dealer shall be several and not joint.  Incapital, as such, shall have full authority to take such action as it deems advisable in all matters pertaining to the Offering of the Securities or arising under this Agreement.  Incapital will have no liability to any Selected Dealer for any act or omission except for obligations expressly assumed by it hereunder, and no obligations on the part of Incapital will be implied hereby or inferred herefrom.
Role of Incapital; Legal Responsibility
 
(d)           .  Upon application to us, we shall inform you as to any advice we have received from counsel concerning the jurisdictions in which Securities have been qualified for sale or are exempt under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions, but we do not assume any obligation or responsibility as to your right to sell Securities in any such jurisdiction.  You agree to:  (a) only engage in a distribution in accordance with the terms of any restrictions in the final Prospectus or offering circular, as applicable; (b) not conduct any distribution which would constitute, in any jurisdiction, a public offer as defined by the law of the relevant
Blue Sky Laws
 
jurisdiction, unless you have requested of us and we have confirmed to you that the Securities are approved for public offer in such jurisdiction; and (c) observe the dates of any subscription period.
 
(e)           .  You represent and warrant, on behalf of yourself and any subsidiary, affiliate, or agent to be used by you in the context of this Agreement, that you and they comply and will comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and all applicable requirements of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING ELECTION OF REPAYMENT UNDER A SURVIVOR'S OPTION
 
Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the meanings defined in the accompanying Election of Repayment  Survivor's Option.
 
1.
    
Collect and retain for a period of at least three years (1) satisfactory evidence of the authority of the Representative, (2) satisfactory evidence of death of the deceased beneficial owner, (3) satisfactory evidence that the deceased beneficial owner beneficially owned, at the time of his or her death, the EdNotes being submitted for repayment, and (4) any necessary tax waivers. For purposes of determining whether the Company will deem EdNotes beneficially owned by an individual at the time of death, the following rules shall apply:
 
                 
EdNotes beneficially owned by tenants by the entirety or joint tenants will be regarded as beneficially owned by a single owner. The death of a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner, and the EdNotes beneficially owned will become eligible for repayment. The death of a person beneficially owning a EdNote by tenancy in common will be deemed the death of a holder of an EdNote only with respect to the deceased holder's interest in the EdNote so held by tenancy in common, unless a husband and wife are the tenants in common, in which case the death of either will be deemed the death of the holder of the EdNote, and the entire principle amount of the EdNote so held will be eligible for repayment.
 
                 
EdNotes beneficially owned by a trust will be regarded as beneficially owned by each beneficiary of the trust to the extent of that beneficiary's interest in the trust (however, a trust's beneficiaries collectively cannot be beneficial owners of more EdNotes than are owned by the trust). The death of a beneficiary of a trust will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of the EdNotes beneficially owned by the trust to the extent of that beneficiary's interest in the trust. The death of an individual who was a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant in a tenancy which is the beneficiary of a trust will be deemed the death of the beneficiary of the trust. The death of an individual who was a tenant in common in a tenancy which is the beneficiary of a trust will be deemed the death of the beneficiary of the trust only with respect to the deceased holder's beneficial interest in the EdNote, unless a husband and wife are the tenants in common, in which case the death of either will be deemed the death of the beneficiary of the trust.
 
                 
The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interest in an EdNote will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of that EdNote, regardless of the registration of ownership, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the EdNotes Trustee. Such beneficial interest will exist in many cases of street name or nominee ownership, ownership by a trustee, ownership under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act and community property or other joint ownership arrangements between spouses. Beneficial interest will be evidenced by such factors as the power to sell or otherwise dispose of an EdNote, the
right to receive the proceeds of sale or disposition and the right to receive interest and principal payments on an EdNote.
