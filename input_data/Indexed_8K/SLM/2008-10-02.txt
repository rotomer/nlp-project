To Our Shareholders:
Over the past several weeks, and in particular over the last several days, we have all witnessed dramatic volatility in the equity and credit markets. In the case of Sallie Mae, we believe markets are overlooking a number of indisputable facts.
The fundamentals of our business are strong.
We are liquid and well capitalized.
Performance remains solid.
In summary, Sallie Mae is a strong, stable and soundly-capitalized company. We are the market leader in the rapidly growing higher education finance industry. We are proud of our legacy; we believe our future is even brighter.
Thank you for your continued support and investment.
Sincerely,
Albert L. Lord Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
