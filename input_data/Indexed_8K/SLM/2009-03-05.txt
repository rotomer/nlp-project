Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 27, 2009, the Compensation and Personnel Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of SLM Corporation amended the SLM Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan for Senior Officers (the "Plan") to limit the "single trigger vesting" event for equity awards. The amendment provides that upon a change in control of the Corporation as defined in the Plan, outstanding, unvested equity awards (the "Awards") vest immediately upon the consummation of the change in control, regardless of termination of employment, only if the surviving corporation does not adopt or assume the Awards. Prior to this amendment, the Awards vested upon the consummation of a change in control of the Corporation, without regard to termination of employment.
