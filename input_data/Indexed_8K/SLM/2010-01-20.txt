Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
(1) On January 15, 2010, HICA Education Loan Corporation, a subsidiary of SLM Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a lending agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank - Des Moines (FHLB). Advances from the FHLB will be backed by eligible collateral including federally-guaranteed student loans. The amount, price and tenor of advances from the FHLB will vary and will be determined at the time of each borrowing. A $25 million funding occurred on January 15, 2010 to initiate this relationship. (2) On January 15, 2010, the Company terminated its existing asset-backed commercial paper facilities totaling $10.875 billion and entered into a new multi-year ABCP facility (the "Facility") totaling $10 billion which will continue to provide funding for the Companys federally-guaranteed student loans. The Facility provides maximum funding of $10 billion for the first year, $5 billion for the second year and $2 billion for the third year. Commitment and other upfront fees were approximately $4.0 million. The underlying cost of borrowing under the new ABCP conduit facility for the first year is expected to be the commercial paper issuance cost plus 0.50 percent for the FFELP loan facilities, excluding up-front commitment and unused fees.
