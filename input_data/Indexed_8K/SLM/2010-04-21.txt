Exhibit 99.1
SLM Corporation (NYSE: SLM), commonly known as Sallie Mae, reported net income on a core earnings basis of $212 million ($.39 per diluted share) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010. On a GAAP basis, first-quarter 2010 net income was $240 million ($.45 per diluted share).
RESTON, Va., April 21, 2010
During the quarter, President Obama signed student loan reform legislation that prohibits private sector companies from making new federal student loans after June 30, 2010; terms of existing loans remain unchanged. As a result, the company has begun to significantly restructure its operations to align its cost structure with future revenues. First-quarter core earnings and GAAP results were reduced by $19 million ($.04 per diluted share) for after-tax restructuring and asset impairment costs related to the legislation.
"As we expected, first-quarter results improved as the financial storm has receded," said Albert L. Lord, vice chairman and CEO. "Ironically, one quarter before the government takes over loan originations, Sallie Mae broke its own FFELP origination record, a testament to the service provided by our talented employees. Of more immediate concern, however, is the unpleasant task of reducing our work force by 2,500 persons and restructuring our operations."
During the quarter, the company repurchased $1.3 billion of unsecured debt, resulting in an after-tax gain of $57 million ($.11 per diluted share).
Core earnings net interest income after provision for loan losses was $343 million in the first quarter, compared to $320 million in the prior quarter and $80 million in the year-ago quarter.
The company originated $7.7 billion in federal student loans in the first quarter, up 16 percent from the year-ago quarter.
Private education loan originations were $840 million in the first quarter, compared to $1.5 billion one year ago, a reflection of tightened underwriting and significant increases in federal programs.
Managed private education loan charge-offs declined to $284 million in the first quarter from $298 million in the previous quarter. Managed delinquencies as a percentage of private education loans in
 
repayment were 12.2 percent, compared to 12.1 percent in the previous quarter, primarily due to the seasonal effect of customers entering repayment. The core earnings provision for private education loan losses was $325 million in the first quarter, down from $327 million in the fourth quarter.
The company continued to improve its balance sheet strength during the quarter. It completed a $1.6 billion private education loan securitization and issued $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes, the first such issuance in 21 months. Subsequent to the quarter end, the company closed a $1.2 billion federal student loan securitization at the most favorable terms since 2007.
Core earnings fee income, which includes the gain on debt repurchases, was $336 million in the first quarter, up from the year-ago quarter's $304 million.
Core earnings operating expenses were $318 million for the quarter, compared to $285 million in the year-ago quarter.
Sallie Mae officially reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also presents certain core earnings performance measures. The company's management, equity investors, credit rating agencies and debt capital providers use these core earnings measures to monitor the company's business performance. Both a description of the core earnings treatment and a full reconciliation to the GAAP income statement can be found at: www.salliemae.com/about/investors/stockholderinfo/earningsinfo/, click on the First Quarter 2010 Supplemental Earnings Disclosure.
The company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board updates as of Jan. 1, 2010, and as a result, the company's GAAP and core earnings presentations for securitization accounting are the same, and managed and on-balance sheet (GAAP) student loan portfolios are now the same size.
The primary difference between the company's first-quarter 2010 core earnings and GAAP results is the impact of derivative and hedge accounting. First-quarter 2010 GAAP results include the net impact of a $122 million unrealized, mark-to-market, pre-tax gain on certain derivative contracts that are recognized in GAAP, but not in core earnings, results.

"Core Earnings"
 
In accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In addition to evaluating the Company's GAAP-based financial information, management evaluates the Company's business segments on a basis that, as allowed under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB's") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," differs from GAAP. We refer to management's basis of evaluating our segment results as "Core Earnings" presentations for each business segment and we refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies and lenders. While "Core Earnings" are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, we rely on "Core Earnings" to manage each operating segment because we believe these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management.
 
Our "Core Earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. "Core Earnings" net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income as described below. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting and as a result, our management reporting is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Our operating segments are defined by products and services or by types of customers, and reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Intersegment revenues and expenses are netted within the appropriate financial statement line items consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management. Changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information.
 
Limitations of "Core Earnings"
 
While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, management believes that "Core Earnings" are an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations. Nevertheless, "Core Earnings" are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, as stated above, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our "Core Earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Unlike GAAP, "Core Earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP. Accordingly, the Company's "Core Earnings" presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not compare our Company's performance with that of other financial services companies based upon "Core Earnings." "Core Earnings" results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, the Company's board of directors, rating agencies and lenders to assess performance.
 
Other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive "Core Earnings" results. For example, in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging," on derivatives that do not qualify for "hedge accounting treatment," as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges, we focus on the long-term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads on the fair value of such instruments during the period. Under GAAP, the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments (but often not on the underlying hedged item) tend to show more volatility in the short term. While our presentation of our results on a "Core Earnings" basis provides important information regarding the performance of our Managed portfolio, a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold to a trust managed by us. While we believe that our "Core Earnings" presentation presents the economic substance of our Managed loan portfolio, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains. Our "Core Earnings" results exclude certain Floor Income, which is real cash income, from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods. Management's financial planning and valuation of operating results, however, does not take into account Floor Income because of its inherent uncertainty, except when it is Fixed Rate Floor Income that is economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts.
 
Pre-Tax Differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP
 
Our "Core Earnings" are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a "Core Earnings" basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision makers. Our "Core Earnings" are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Company's core business activities. "Core Earnings" net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income, as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP that follows, which includes further detail on each specific adjustment required to reconcile our "Core Earnings" segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.
