Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 SLM Corporation (NYSE: SLM), commonly known as Sallie Mae, reported core earnings net income of $189 million ($.35 diluted earnings per share) for the third-quarter 2010, compared to $164 million ($.26 diluted earnings per share) for the year-ago quarter.
RESTON, Va., Oct. 19, 2010
"This quarter's results are indicative of our current earnings power until we finish rightsizing the company in 2011," said Albert L. Lord, vice chairman and CEO. "We recognize the magnitude of this task and are confident that we will achieve it."
On a GAAP basis, the company reported a net loss of $495 million ($1.06 diluted loss per share), vs. $159 million net income ($.25 diluted earnings per share) in the same quarter last year, after writing off $660 million of goodwill and intangible assets and an unrealized, net loss from the mark to market on hedging activity. The former is primarily the result of new market data and the business impact of recent legislation: the company determined that goodwill and intangible assets within certain operating segments were impaired. The non-cash charge does not impact the company's tangible capital or capital ratios.
During the quarter, the company originated $835 million in private education loans, 92 percent of which had cosigners.
In addition to its owned and serviced loans, the company serviced in the third quarter approximately 2.5 million accounts on behalf of the federal government and other third-party clients. Since quarter end, the servicing operation has added 1.3 million third-party accounts.
In September, the company announced an agreement to purchase an interest in $28 billion of securitized federal student loans and related assets from The Student Loan Corporation. The transaction is expected to close by year-end 2010.
The company had $25.8 billion of private education loans in repayment at Sept. 30, compared to $21.7 billion one year earlier. At the same time, third-quarter 2010 delinquencies as a percentage of private education loans in repayment (11.1 percent) declined from the previous quarter (11.9 percent) and the year-ago quarter (12.6 percent). This favorable trend reflects the improving quality of the portfolio.
The third-quarter 2010 private education loan loss provision was $330 million, down from both the previous and year-ago quarters. Net charge-offs were $348 million in the 2010 third quarter, an
 
expected seasonal increase from the second quarter's $336 million related to the timing of graduates' entry into repayment, and a decrease from the year-ago quarter's $443 million.
In the third quarter, the company completed a $760 million federal student loan securitization and two private loan securitizations totaling $2.6 billion.
The company used the private loan transaction proceeds to redeem $1.5 billion of higher-priced issuances and to net approximately $1 billion.
Core earnings fee income was $227 million in the third quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter's $337 million that included a $74 million gain from debt repurchases.
Core earnings operating expenses excluding restructuring and related asset impairments were $319 million in the third-quarter 2010, compared to $331 million in the previous quarter and $303 million in the year-ago quarter.
Sallie Mae reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also presents certain core earnings performance measures. The company's management, equity investors, credit rating agencies and debt capital providers use these core earnings measures to monitor the company's business performance. Both a description of the core earnings treatment and a full reconciliation to the GAAP income statement can be found at by clicking on Earnings.

The company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board updates as of Jan. 1, 2010, and as a result, the company's GAAP and core earnings presentations for securitization accounting are the same, and managed and on-balance sheet (GAAP) student loan portfolios are now the same size.
The primary difference between the company's third-quarter 2010 core earnings and GAAP results is the impact of a $660 million goodwill and intangible asset pre-tax impairment and a $183 million unrealized, mark-to-market, pre-tax loss on certain derivative contracts, both of which are recognized in GAAP but not in core earnings results.

"Core Earnings"
 
In accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In addition to evaluating the Company's GAAP-based financial information, management evaluates the Company's business segments on a basis that, as allowed under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB's") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," differs from GAAP. We refer to management's basis of evaluating our segment results as "Core Earnings" presentations for each business segment and we refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. While "Core Earnings" are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, we rely on "Core Earnings" to manage each operating segment because we believe these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management.
 
Our "Core Earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. "Core Earnings" net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income as described below. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative
 
guidance for management reporting and as a result, our management reporting is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Our operating segments are defined by products and services or by types of customers, and reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Intersegment revenues and expenses are netted within the appropriate financial statement line items consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management. Changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information.
 
Limitations of "Core Earnings"
 
While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, management believes that "Core Earnings" are an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations. Nevertheless, "Core Earnings" are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, as stated above, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our "Core Earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Unlike GAAP, "Core Earnings" reflect only current period adjustments to GAAP. Accordingly, the Company's "Core Earnings" presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not compare our Company's performance with that of other financial services companies based upon "Core Earnings." "Core Earnings" results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, the Company's board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.
 
Other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive "Core Earnings" results. For example, in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging," on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges, we focus on the long-term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads on the fair value of such instruments during the period. Under GAAP, the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments (but often not on the underlying hedged item) tend to show more volatility in the short term. While presentation of our results on a "Core Earnings" basis provides important information regarding the performance of our Managed portfolio, a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold off-balance sheet for GAAP purposes to a trust managed by us. While we believe that our "Core Earnings" presentation presents the economic substance of our Managed loan portfolio, it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains, securitization servicing income and Residual Interest Income. Our "Core Earnings" results exclude certain Floor Income, which is real cash income, from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods. Management's financial planning and valuation of operating results, however, does not take into account Floor Income because of its inherent uncertainty, except when it is Fixed Rate Floor Income that is economically hedged through Floor Income Contracts.
 
Pre-Tax Differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP
 
Our "Core Earnings" are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. Accordingly, financial information is reported to management on a "Core Earnings" basis by reportable segment, as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision makers. Our "Core Earnings" are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results, and also in establishing corporate performance targets and incentive compensation. Management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the Company's core business activities. "Core Earnings" net income reflects only current period adjustments to GAAP net income, as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP that follows, which includes further detail on each specific adjustment required to reconcile our "Core Earnings" segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.
 
 
 
Upon the adoption of topic updates to ASC 810, the Company removed the $1.8 billion of Residual Interests (associated with its off-balance sheet securitization trusts as of December 31, 2009) from the consolidated balance sheet and the Company consolidated $35.0 billion of assets ($32.6 billion of which are student loans, net of a $550 million allowance for loan losses) and $34.4 billion of liabilities (primarily trust debt), which resulted in an approximate $750 million after-tax reduction of stockholders' equity (recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings). After the adoption of topic updates to ASC 810, the Company's results of operations no longer reflect securitization servicing and Residual Interest revenue (loss) related to these securitization trusts, but instead report interest income, provisions for loan losses associated with the securitized assets and interest expense associated with the debt issued from the securitization trusts to third parties, consistent with the Company's accounting treatment of prior on-balance securitization trusts.
