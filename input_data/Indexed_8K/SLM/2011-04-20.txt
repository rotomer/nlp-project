A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
CONTACTS:
 
 
 
  Sallie Mae (NYSE: SLM) today reported first-quarter GAAP and core earnings, declared its first common stock dividend since 2007 and announced a $300 million share repurchase program.
NEWARK, Del., April 20, 2011
 
GAAP first-quarter 2011 net income was $175 million ($.32 diluted earnings per share), vs. $240 million ($.45 diluted earnings per share) in the same quarter last year. The company manages its business segments on a core earnings basis, as described further below. The primary difference between the company's core earnings and GAAP results is a $133 million unrealized, loss on certain derivative contracts recognized in GAAP but not in core earnings results.
mark-to-market,
 
Core earnings were $260 million ($.48 diluted earnings per share) for the first-quarter 2011, compared with $215 million ($.40 diluted earnings per share) for the year-ago period. These results include $40 million and $57 million of after-tax debt repurchase gains, respectively. improvement reflects increased net interest income and a lower loan loss provision.
Year-to-year
 
 
Sallie Mae declared a quarterly dividend of $.10 per share on the company's common stock, the first since early 2007. The dividend is payable June 17, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 3, 2011. The company also authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of outstanding common stock in open-market transactions and terminated all previous authorizations.
 
"These results reflect progress," said Albert L. Lord, vice chairman and CEO, Sallie Mae. "The trends we see across the franchise are improving: private loan demand, ABS market tone, and asset quality together with a better Department of Education loan servicing scorecard. Reinstitution of the dividend and share repurchase program reflects the strength of our capital, liquidity and cash flow."
 
 
In the consumer lending segment, Sallie Mae originates, finances and services private education loans. Loan originations were $940 million, up 12 percent from the year-ago quarter's $840 million. The portfolio totaled $36 billion at March 31, 2011.
 
First-quarter core earnings from this segment improved to $44 million from $5 million in the year-ago quarter. Loan delinquencies and charge-offs (each as a percentage of loans in repayment) improved during the quarter to the lowest levels since Dec. 31, 2008. Highlights vs. first-quarter 2010 included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The business services segment includes fees from servicing, collections and college savings businesses.
 
During the quarter, the company announced a Sallie Mae Bank No-Fee Student Checking Account with Debit as an enhanced refund disbursement choice for schools and students to help higher education institutions rapidly process financial aid and tuition refunds. This new option complements existing refund disbursement choices that include electronic deposit to the bank account of the student's choice, or a check.
 
Core earnings from the business services segment were $132 million in the first-quarter 2011, compared with $141 million in the year-ago quarter, the decrease primarily due to reduced revenue from the servicing of FFELP loans.
 
 
The Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loan business segment represents earnings from Sallie Mae's federal student loan portfolio. The company no longer originates FFELP loans.
 
Core earnings from the FFELP loan segment were $109 million in the first-quarter 2011, compared with $64 million in the year-ago quarter, with the increase primarily driven by the purchase of $25 billion of loans at the end of last year.
 
 
Operating expenses were $303 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $308 million in fourth quarter 2010 and $287 million in the year-ago period. Operating expenses in the 2011 first quarter included the following $33 million: $10 million for litigation contingencies, $11 million for accelerated stock compensation expense, and $12 million of servicing costs related to the $25 billion student loan portfolio acquisition at the end of last year. These charges notwithstanding, the company expects to achieve its quarterly operating expense target of $250 million by the fourth-quarter 2011.
 
 
During the 2011 first quarter, the company raised $2 billion of unsecured debt and issued $812 million of FFELP asset-backed securities. Also, the company repurchased $825 million of debt and realized gains of $64 million, compared to $1.3 billion and $90 million in the year-ago quarter, respectively.
 
Subsequent to quarter end, the company priced $562 million in private education loan asset-backed securities below LIBOR plus 2 percent.
 
 
Sallie Mae reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also presents certain core earnings performance measures. The company's management, equity investors, credit rating agencies and debt capital providers use these core earnings measures to monitor the company's business performance. See "Core Earnings  Definitions and Limitations" for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and core earnings.
 
Definitions for capitalized terms in this document can be found in the company's 2010 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2011. Certain reclassifications have been made to the balances as of and for the quarters ended December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, to be consistent with classifications adopted for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, and had no effect on net income, total assets, or total liabilities.

Results of Operations
 
We present the results of operations below first on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. Following our discussion of consolidated earnings results on a GAAP basis, we present our results on a segment basis. We have four business segments: FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending, Business Services and Other. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments and we manage and evaluate the financial performance of these segments using non-GAAP financial measures, these segments are presented on a "Core Earnings" basis (see " Core Earnings' Definitions and Limitations").
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated Earnings Summary  GAAP-basis
 
Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2010
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, net income was $175 million, or $.32 diluted earnings per common share, and $240 million, or $.45 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, net income from continuing operations was $177 million, or $.32 diluted earnings per common share, and $247 million, or $.46 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, net loss from discontinued operations was $2 million, which had minimal effect on diluted loss per common share, and $7 million, or $.01 diluted loss per common share, respectively.
 
Income from Continuing Operations
 
Income from continuing operations before income tax expenses decreased $130 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, as compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to a $160 million increase in net losses on derivative and hedging activities, a $52 million decrease in gains on debt repurchases and a $24 million decline in servicing revenue. These reductions were partially offset by a $100 million increase in net interest income after provisions for loan losses.
 
The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the period are as follows:
year-over-year
 
 
 
 
 
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations
 
Net loss from discontinued operations in the three months ended March 31, 2011 decreased $5 million from the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper  Non Mortgage business for sale and have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year at which time we would exit the business. As a result, the results of operations of this business were also required to be presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods.
 
Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 Compared with Three Months Ended December 31, 2010
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, net income was $175 million, or $.32 diluted earnings per common share, and $447 million, or $.84 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, net income from continuing operations was $177 million, or $.32 diluted earnings per common share, and $499 million, or $.94 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, net loss from discontinued operations was $2 million, which had no effect on reported diluted earnings per common share, and $52 million, or $.10 diluted loss per common share, respectively.
 
Income from Continuing Operations
 
Income from continuing operations before income tax expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2011, by $484 million as compared with the prior quarter primarily due to a $318 million decrease in net gains on sales of loans and securities, a $213 million increase in net losses on derivative and hedging activities and a $80 million decline in gains on debt repurchases. These were partially offset by a $58 million increase in net interest income after provisions for loans losses.
 
The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the period are as follows:
quarter-over-quarter
 
 
 
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations
 
Net loss from discontinued operations in the quarter ended March 31, 2011 was $2 million compared with a net loss from discontinued operations of $52 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we began actively marketing our Purchased Paper  Non Mortgage business for sale and have concluded it is probable this business will be sold within one year at which time we would exit the business. As a result, the results of operations of this business were also required to be presented in discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with this presentation, we are required to carry this business at the lower of fair value or historical cost basis. As a result, we recorded an after-tax loss of $52 million from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to adjusting the value of this business to its estimated fair value. Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods.
 
"Core Earnings"  Definition and Limitations
 
We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as "Core Earnings". We provide this "Core Earnings" basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we internally review when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide "Core Earnings" disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments.
 
"Core Earnings" are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use "Core Earnings" to manage each business segment because "Core Earnings" reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for two items, discussed below, that create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that "Core Earnings" provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information as we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. The two items adjusted for in our "Core Earnings" presentations are: (1) our use of derivatives instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness and (2) the accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
 
While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation does not. "Core Earnings" are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our "Core Earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our "Core Earnings" presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon "Core Earnings." "Core Earnings" results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.
 
Specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation are described in detail in the section entitled " Core Earnings'  Definition and Limitations  " below.
Differences between Core Earnings' and GAAP
 
The following tables show "Core Earnings" for each business segment and our business as a whole along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the amounts to our reported GAAP results as required by GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP
 
The following discussion summarizes the differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP net income, and details each specific adjustment required to reconcile our "Core Earnings" segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.
 
 
 
The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting on our net income for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010 when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the adoption of ASC 815 related to accounting for derivative financial instruments.
 
 
 
 
Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities
 
The derivative accounting requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as "realized (gains) losses on derivative and hedging activities") that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement
 
line item below net interest income. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a "Core Earnings" basis for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Segment Earnings Summary  "Core Earnings" Basis
 
FFELP Loans Segment
 
The following table includes "Core Earnings" results for our FFELP Loans segment.
 
 
FFELP Loans "Core Earnings" Net Interest Margin
 
The following table shows the FFELP Loans "Core Earnings" net interest margin along with reconciliation to the GAAP-basis FFELP Loans net interest margin.
 
 
 
 
 
The "Core Earnings" basis FFELP Loans net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 decreased by 1 basis point from the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of higher cost of funds primarily caused by our issuance of $2 billion of unsecured debt in the first quarter of 2011 which offset a higher margin earned on the acquisition of $25 billion in securitized FFELP loans on December 31, 2010. The "Core Earnings" basis FFELP Loans net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 increased by 15 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This was primarily the result of the replacement of the $20 billion lower margin loans sold to ED in third quarter 2010 by the $25 billion in higher margin loans acquired on December 31, 2010 and an increase in Floor Income. These increases were partially offset by a higher cost of funds in the current quarter as higher cost debt has been issued in the past year compared to the historical funding portfolio.
 
As of March 31, 2011, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled approximately $145.6 billion, comprised of $54.4 billion of FFELP Stafford and $91.2 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted average life of these portfolios is 4.9 years and 9.4 years, respectively, assuming a CPR of 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
 
FFELP Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge-Offs
 
The following tables summarize the FFELP provisions for loan losses and FFELP loan charge-offs for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
Servicing Revenue and Other Income  FFELP Loans Segment
 
The following table summarizes the components of "Core Earnings" other income for our FFELP Loans segment for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
Servicing revenue for our FFELP Loans segment primarily consists of late fees.
 
The gain on sale of loans and securities primarily relates to gains on sales of loans to ED as part of the Purchase Program. In the fourth quarter of 2010 we sold $20.4 billion face amount of FFELP Loans to ED which resulted in a $321 million gain. These gains will not occur in the future as FFELP originations and the Purchase Program ended in 2010.
 
Operating Expenses  FFELP Loans Segment
 
Operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment primarily include the contractual rates we are paid to service loans in term asset-backed securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility (which is presented as an intercompany charge from the Business Services segment who services the loans), the fees we pay for third party loan servicing and costs incurred to acquire loans. For the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment totaled $195 million, $180 million and $188 million, respectively. The increase in operating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the prior quarter and year-ago quarter was primarily the increase in servicing costs related to the $25 billion loan portfolio acquisition on December 31, 2010. The intercompany
 
servicing revenue charged from the Business Services segment and included in those amounts was $189 million, $155 million and $164 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring-related asset impairments, were 54 basis points, 54 basis points and 52 basis points of average FFELP Loans in the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively.
 
Consumer Lending Segment
 
The following table includes "Core Earnings" results for our Consumer Lending segment.
 
 
Consumer Lending "Core Earnings" Net Interest Margin
 
The following table shows the Consumer Lending "Core Earnings" net interest margin along with reconciliation to the GAAP-basis Consumer Lending net interest margin before provisions for loan losses.
 
 
 
 
 
The Consumer Lending net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 increased 19 basis points from the prior quarter and 27 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The Private Education Loan spread remained relatively unchanged. The size of the Other asset portfolio (which is primarily securitization trust restricted cash and cash held at our bank) has decreased significantly since the first quarter 2010. This Other asset portfolio earns a negative yield and as a result, when its relative weighting decreases compared to the Private Education Loan portfolio, the overall net interest margin increases. This is the primary driver of the increase in the net interest margin compared to prior periods.
 
Private Education Loans Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge-Offs
 
The following tables summarize the total Private Education Loans provisions for loan losses and charge-offs for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
The first-quarter 2011 provision expense and charge-offs are down from the prior quarter and year-ago quarter as the portfolio's credit performance continued to improve since the weakening in the U.S. economy that began in 2008, with the expected future performance continuing to improve as well. The Private Education Loan portfolio experienced a significant increase in delinquencies through the first quarter of 2010 (delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment were 12.2 percent at March 31, 2010); since then delinquencies as a percentage of loans in repayment have declined to 10.4 percent at March 31, 2011. Private Education Loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance remained unchanged from the prior quarter at 4.6 percent and decreased from 5.1 percent at March 31, 2010. Charge-offs as a percentage of loans in repayment have declined significantly from 4.7 percent in the first quarter 2010 to 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2011. The Private Education Loan allowance coverage of annual charge-offs ratio was 1.8 at March 31, 2011 compared with 1.6 at December 31, 2010, and 1.7 at March 31, 2010. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending Private Education Loans in repayment decreased from 8.2 percent at March 31, 2010 to 7.2 percent at March 31, 2011. We analyzed changes in the key ratios when determining the appropriate Private Education Loan allowance for loan losses.
 
Servicing Revenue and Other Income  Consumer Lending Segment
 
Servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment primarily includes late fees and forbearance fees. For the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, servicing revenue for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $17 million, $15 million and $19 million, respectively.
 
Operating Expenses  Consumer Lending Segment
 
Operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment include costs incurred to originate Private Education Loans and to service and collect on our Private Education Loan portfolio. For the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and March 31, 2010, operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment totaled $82 million, $85 million and $80 million, respectively. Operating expenses declined in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the prior quarter primarily as a result of our cost cutting initiatives. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring-related asset impairments, were 90 basis points, 92 basis points, and 88 basis points, respectively, of average Private Education Loans in the first quarter of 2011, the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2010, respectively.
 
Business Services Segment
 
The following tables include "Core Earnings" results for our Business Services segment.
 
 
Our Business Services segment earns intercompany loan servicing fees from servicing the FFELP Loans in our FFELP Loans segment. The average balance of this portfolio was $144 billion, $119 billion and $129 billion for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively. The increase in Intercompany loan servicing revenue from the prior and year-ago quarters is primarily the result of the acquisition of the $25 billion FFELP Loan portfolio on December 31, 2010 which was partially offset by the amortization of the underlying portfolio as well as the FFELP Loans sold to ED as part of the Participation Program in 2010.
 
We are servicing approximately 3.2 million accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of March 31, 2011. Loan servicing fees in the first quarter of 2011, the fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2010 included $15 million, $16 million and $9 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the loans we are servicing under the ED Servicing Contract.
 
Account asset servicing revenue represents fees earned on program management, transfer and servicing agent services and administration services for our various 529 college-savings plans.
 
Campus Payment Solutions revenue is earned from our Campus Payment Solutions business whose services include comprehensive financing and transaction processing solutions that we provide to college financial aid offices and students to streamline the financial aid process.
 
The decrease in Guarantor servicing revenue compared with the year-ago period was primarily due to HCERA being effective as of July 1, 2010 and our no longer earning Guarantor issuance fees and the lower balance of outstanding FFELP Loans on which we earn other fees.
 
The following table presents the outstanding inventory of contingent collections receivables that our Business Services segment will collect on behalf of others.
 
 
Transaction fees are earned in conjunction with our rewards program from participating companies based on member purchase activity, either online or in stores, depending on the contractual arrangement with the participating company. Typically, a percentage of the purchase price of the consumer members' eligible purchases with participating companies is set aside in an account maintained by us on behalf of our members.
 
Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 77 percent, 75 percent and 79 percent, respectively, of total segment revenues for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
Operating Expenses  Business Services Segment
 
For the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, operating expenses for the Business Services segment totaled $128 million, $127 million and $118 million, respectively. Operating expenses increased from the prior periods primarily as a result of the increase in servicing costs associated with the loan portfolio acquisition on December 31, 2010.
 
Other Segment
 
The following table includes "Core Earnings" results of our Other segment
 
 
Purchased Paper Business
 
Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. (See "Consolidated Earnings Summary  GAAP-basis" for further discussion.)
 
The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Purchased Paper  Non-Mortgage portfolio:
 
 
Gains on Debt Repurchases
 
We began repurchasing our outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008. We repurchased $825 million, $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2008, we repurchased $11.1 billion face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2008 to 2016.
 
Overhead
 
Corporate overhead is comprised of costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and stock option expense. Unallocated information technology costs are related to infrastructure and operations.
 
For the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, operating expenses for the Other segment totaled $87 million, $71 million and $65 million, respectively. The increase in corporate overhead expenses in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the prior quarter and the prior year quarter is primarily the result of a change in the terms of our stock compensation plans. In the first quarter, we changed our stock compensation plans so that retirement eligible employees would not forfeit unvested stock compensation upon their retirement. This change had the effect of accelerating the future stock compensation expenses associated with these unvested stock grants into the current period for those employees that are retirement eligible.
 
Financial Condition
 
This section provides additional information regarding the changes related to our loan portfolio assets and related liabilities as well as credit performance indicators related to our Consumer Lending portfolio.

The following table summarizes our Private Education Loan originations.

Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses
 
The following tables summarize changes in the allowance for Private Education Loan losses for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
The following table provides detail for the traditional and non-traditional Private Education Loans at March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
The table below shows the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). As indicated in the table, the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At March 31, 2011, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were 6.3 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for less than 25 months. The percentage drops to 1.9 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for more than 48 months. Approximately 77 percent of our "Core Earnings" basis Private Education Loans in forbearance status has been in active repayment status less than 25 months.
 
 
 
 
 
As we have obtained further experience about the effectiveness of forbearance, we have reduced the amount of time a loan will spend in forbearance, thereby increasing our ongoing contact with the borrower to encourage consistent repayment behavior once the loan is returned to a current repayment status. As a result, the balance of loans in a forbearance status as of month-end has decreased since 2008. In addition, the monthly average number of loans granted forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance remained relatively flat at 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the year-ago quarter of 5.3 percent. As of March 31, 2011, 2.6 percent of loans in current status were delinquent as of the end of the prior month, but were granted a forbearance that made them current as of March 31, 2011 (borrowers made payments on approximately 24 percent of these loans immediately prior to being granted forbearance).
 
Receivable for Partially Charged-Off Private Education Loans
 
At the end of each month, for loans that are 212 days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance. Actual recoveries are applied against the remaining loan balance that was not charged off. We refer to this remaining loan balance as the "receivable for partially charged-off loans." If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is charged off and immediately included in provision expense.
 
The following tables summarize the activity in the receivable for partially charged-off loans for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
Funding, Liquidity and Capital
 
The following table details our main sources of primary liquidity and the available capacity at March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
 
 
In addition to the assets listed in the table above, we hold a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans and other assets. At March 31, 2011, we had a total of $24.1 billion of unencumbered assets, excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles. Total student loans, net, comprised $14.3 billion of this unencumbered asset total of which $11.9 billion relates to Private Education Loans, net.
 
The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total tangible equity.
 
 
 
 
On April 14, 2011, we priced a $562 million Private Education Loan ABS transaction at an all-in LIBOR equivalent cost of one-month LIBOR plus 1.99 percent. This issue has a weighted average life of 3.8 years and initial over-collateralization of approximately 21 percent. This issue is expected to close on April 26, 2011.
 
On March 3, 2011, we completed an $812 million FFELP ABS transaction at an all-in LIBOR equivalent cost of one-month LIBOR plus 1.14 percent. This issue has a weighted average life of 5.8 years and initial over-collateralization of approximately 3 percent.
 
On January 14, 2011, we issued a $2 billion five-year 6.25 percent fixed rate unsecured bond. The bond was issued to yield 6.50 percent before underwriting fees. The rate on the bond was swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate equal to an all-in cost of one-month LIBOR plus 4.46 percent. The proceeds of this bond will be used for general corporate purposes.
 
We also repurchase our outstanding unsecured debt in both open-market repurchases and public tender offers. Repurchasing debt helps us to better manage our short-term and long-term funding needs. In the first quarter of 2011 we repurchased $825 million face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates ranging from 2011 to 2014, which resulted in a total gain of $64 million.

The following table presents the ending balances of our "Core Earnings" basis borrowings at March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010.
 
 
 
 
In March 2011, we retired all 70 million shares of common stock held in treasury. This retirement decreased the balance in treasury stock by $1.9 billion, with corresponding decreases of $14 million in common stock and $1.9 billion in additional paid-in capital. There was no impact to total equity from this transaction.
