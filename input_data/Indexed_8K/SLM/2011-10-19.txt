Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 19, 2011, SLM Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
  Sallie Mae (NYSE: SLM) today released third-quarter 2011 financial results highlighting increased student loan originations, lower delinquency rates and charge-offs, and declining operating expenses, as compared to third-quarter 2010.
NEWARK, Del., Oct. 19, 2011
"I am pleased by the strong growth in assets," said Albert L. Lord, vice chairman and CEO, Sallie Mae. "Loan portfolio quality continues to improve, though the economic slump and long-term unemployment have reduced default recoveries, keeping us at conservative reserve levels."
A $371 million "mark-to-market" unrealized loss on certain derivative contracts resulted in a $47 million GAAP third-quarter 2011 net loss ($.10 per diluted share), compared with a net loss of $495 million ($1.06 per diluted share) for the year-ago quarter. Last year's third-quarter GAAP loss included mark-to-market losses of $269 million and a $660 million impairment of goodwill and intangibles. These mark-to-market losses and goodwill and intangible impairments are recognized in GAAP but not in core earnings results.
Core earnings for the quarter were $188 million ($.36 per diluted share), compared with $202 million ($.37 per diluted share) in the year-ago period. The company also reports results on a core earnings basis because management utilizes this information in making key business decisions.
Both GAAP and core earnings third-quarter 2011 results included the following: an additional $124 million ($.15 per diluted share) of provision for private education loan losses attributable to the adoption of recent accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs); and a $35 million ($.04 per diluted share) gain on the sale of the company's discontinued purchased paper business.
Consumer Lending
In the consumer lending segment, Sallie Mae originates, finances and services private education loans.
The $124 million cumulative effect due to TDR accounting resulted in a core loss for the quarter of $27 million, compared with a core loss of $3 million in the third-quarter 2010.
Loan delinquency and charge-off rates improved 12 percent and 31 percent, respectively, from the year-ago quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter of such improvements. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting TDR accounting guidance, the provision for private education loan losses declined significantly year-over-year.
Highlights vs. third-quarter 2010 included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Business Services
Sallie Mae's business services segment includes fees from servicing, collections and college savings businesses.
Core earnings were $139 million in third-quarter 2011, compared with $131 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was driven by substantial FFELP loan acquisitions last year that have increased FFELP loan servicing revenue.
The company's allocation of new customer loans awarded for servicing under its contract with the U.S. Department of Education recently increased from 22 percent to 26 percent for the current contract year ending Aug. 15, 2012. The increase was driven primarily by the company's top ranking for default prevention performance results. Sallie Mae now provides service to 3.4 million loan customers on behalf of the Department of Education.
During the quarter, the company announced the launch of Sallie Mae Insurance Services, a new portfolio of insurance products designed to help families protect their investment in higher education. The new tuition, renters and student health insurance safeguards are offered both to families and to higher education institutions.
Federally Guaranteed Loans (FFELP)
This segment represents earnings from Sallie Mae's amortizing portfolio of FFELP loans.
Core earnings were $107 million in third-quarter 2011, compared with $108 million in the year-ago quarter.
Operating Expenses
Third-quarter operating expenses were $285 million in 2011, compared with $302 million in the year-ago quarter and $268 million in second-quarter 2011.
Operating expenses in third-quarter 2011 included $15 million related to the pending termination of the company's defined benefit retirement plan and $8 million of servicing costs related to the $25 billion student loan portfolio acquisition at the end of last year. The company completed conversion of the acquired portfolio to its loan servicing system in October 2011 and expects servicing costs to continue to decline as a result.
Funding and Liquidity
On Oct. 5, 2011, Sallie Mae closed on a $3.4 billion asset-backed commercial paper facility which matures in January 2014. This facility will provide, subject to certain conditions, the financing to call the 2009-B and 2009-C private student loan trust securities at a reduced cost of funds. The securities are first callable in November 2011 and January 2012, respectively.
Dividend and Common Share Repurchase Program
In third-quarter 2011, Sallie Mae paid a common stock dividend of $.10 per share and repurchased 9.5 million common shares for $144 million. With this action, the company has fully utilized its previously announced $300 million share repurchase authorization acquiring a total of 19.1 million shares.
Guidance
The company expects 2011 results to be as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sallie Mae reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also presents certain core earnings performance measures. The primary differences between the company's pre-tax core earnings and GAAP results for the periods presented were the unrealized, mark-to-market losses on certain derivative contracts and the treatment of goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. The company's management, equity investors, credit rating agencies and debt capital providers use these core earnings measures to monitor the company's business performance. See "Core Earnings  Definition and Limitations" for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and core earnings. Given the significant variability of valuations of derivative instruments on expected GAAP net income, the company does not provide a GAAP equivalent for its core earnings per share guidance.
Definitions for capitalized terms in this document can be found in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010 (filed with the SEC on Feb. 28, 2011). Certain reclassifications have been made to the balances as of and for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2010, to be consistent with classifications adopted for 2011, and had no effect on net income, total assets, or total liabilities.

Results of Operations
We present the results of operations below on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of our results on a segment basis is not in accordance with GAAP. We have four business segments: FFELP Loans, Consumer Lending, Business Services and Other. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments and we manage and evaluate the financial performance of these segments using non-GAAP financial measures, these segments are presented on a "Core Earnings" basis (see "Core Earnings'  Definitions and Limitations").
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated Earnings Summary  GAAP-basis
Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2010
For the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, net loss was $47 million, or $.10 diluted loss per common share, and $495 million, or $1.06 diluted loss per common share, respectively. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to $660 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, which were partially non-tax deductible, recorded in the third quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by a $136 million increase in net losses on derivative and hedging activities and $124 million of additional provision for loan losses in connection with adopting new accounting guidance in the third quarter of 2011 related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs").
The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in net income for the current quarter compared with the year-ago quarter are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, net income was $122 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per common share, and $83 million, or $.06 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 as compared with the prior year period was primarily due to $660 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, which were partially non-tax deductible, recorded in the year-ago period and a $96 million decrease in the provisions for loan losses. This was partially offset by a $900 million increase in net losses on derivative and hedging activities and a $161 million decrease in gains on debt repurchases.
The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in net income for the current nine-month period compared with the year-ago nine-month period are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Core Earnings"  Definition and Limitations
We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as "Core Earnings." We provide this "Core Earnings" basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we internally review when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide "Core Earnings" disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments.
"Core Earnings" are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use "Core Earnings" to manage each business segment because "Core Earnings" reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for two items, discussed below, that create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that "Core Earnings" provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information as we believe it provides investors with additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. The two items adjusted for in our "Core Earnings" presentations are: (1) our use of derivatives instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness and (2) the accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation does not. "Core Earnings" are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our "Core Earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our "Core Earnings" presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon "Core Earnings." "Core Earnings" results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.
Specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation are described in detail in the section entitled "Core Earnings'  Definition and Limitations " below.
Differences between Core Earnings' and GAAP
 
The following tables show "Core Earnings" for each business segment and our business as a whole along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the amounts to our reported GAAP results as required by GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP
The following discussion summarizes the differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP net income (loss), and details each specific adjustment required to reconcile our "Core Earnings" segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.
 
 
The table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting on our net income for the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the adoption of ASC 815 related to accounting for derivative financial instruments.
 
 
 
 
Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities
The derivative accounting requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as "realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities") that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a "Core Earnings" basis for the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Business Segment Earnings Summary  "Core Earnings" Basis
FFELP Loans Segment
The following table includes "Core Earnings" results for our FFELP Loans segment.
 
 
FFELP Loans Net Interest Margin
The following table shows the FFELP Loans "Core Earnings" basis net interest margin along with reconciliation to the GAAP-basis FFELP Loans net interest margin.
 
 
 
The increase in the "Core Earnings" basis FFELP Loans net interest margin of 7 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in Floor Income due to lower interest rates.
As of September 30, 2011, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled approximately $140.7 billion, comprised of $51.7 billion of FFELP Stafford and $89.0 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted-average life of these portfolios is 5.0 years and 9.2 years, respectively, assuming a Constant Prepayment Rate ("CPR") of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
FFELP Provisions for Loan Losses and Loan Charge-Offs
The following tables summarize the FFELP Loan provisions for loan losses and FFELP Loan charge-offs for the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
 
Operating Expenses  FFELP Loans Segment
Operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment primarily include the contractual rates we pay to service loans in term asset-backed securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility (which is presented as an intercompany charge from the Business Services segment who services the loans), the fees we pay for third-party loan servicing and costs incurred to acquire loans. The increases in operating expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily the result of the increase in servicing costs related to the $25 billion loan portfolio acquisition on December 31, 2010. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring-related asset impairments, were 52 basis points and 49 basis points of average FFELP Loans in the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 53 basis points and 50 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Consumer Lending Segment
The following table includes "Core Earnings" results for our Consumer Lending segment.
 
 
Consumer Lending Net Interest Margin
The following table shows the Consumer Lending "Core Earnings" net interest margin along with reconciliation to the GAAP-basis Consumer Lending net interest margin before provisions for loan losses.
 
 
 
The increase in the "Core Earnings" basis Consumer Lending net interest margin over both the year-ago quarter and nine month period was primarily the result of a benefit from the decline in the average balance of our Other asset portfolio, which more than offset the effect of the lower discount amortization due to lower prepayment speeds. The size of the Other asset portfolio, which is primarily securitization trust restricted cash and cash held at Sallie Mae Bank (the "Bank"), has decreased significantly. This Other asset portfolio earns a negative yield and as a result, when its relative weighting decreases compared to the Private Education Loan portfolio, the overall net interest margin increases.
 
 
Private Education Loans Provision for Loan Losses and Charge-Offs
The following tables summarize the total Private Education Loans provision for loan losses and charge-offs for the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:
 
We recorded an additional $124 million of provision for Private Education Loan losses for the quarter to reflect the cumulative, year-to-date effect of adopting new accounting rules related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"). For a complete discussion of the effect of these new rules on our provision for Private Education Loan losses, see "Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  Troubled Debt Restructurings".
In establishing the allowance for Private Education Loan losses for the quarter, we considered several additional emerging environmental factors with respect to our Private Education Loan portfolio. In particular, we continue to see improving credit quality and continuing positive delinquency and charge-off trends in connection with this portfolio. Improving credit quality is seen in higher FICO scores and cosigner rates as well as a more seasoned portfolio compared to the year-ago quarter. The overall delinquency rate has declined to 10.3 percent from 11.1 percent and the charge-off rate has declined to 3.7 percent from 5.4 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.
Apart from these overall improvements in credit quality, delinquency and charge-off trends, Private Education Loans which defaulted between 2008 and 2011 for which we have previously charged off estimated losses have, to varying degrees, not met our recovery expectations to date and may continue not to do so. According to our policy, we have been charging off these periodic shortfalls in expected recoveries against our allowance for Private Education Loan losses and the related receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans and we will continue to do so. Differences in actual future recoveries on these defaulted loans could affect our receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans. We have increased our provision for Private Education Loan losses for the quarter in the amount of $143 million to reflect these uncertainties. Continuing historically high unemployment rates may negatively affect future Private Education Loan default and recovery expectations over our estimated two-year loss confirmation period. Consequently, in accordance with our policy, we have also given consideration to these factors in projecting charge-offs for this period and establishing our allowance for Private Education Loan losses. We will continue to monitor defaults and recoveries in light of the continuing weak economy and high unemployment rates. For a more detailed discussion of our policy for determining the collectability of Private Education Loan and maintaining our allowance for Private Education Loan losses, see Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies" to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
 
Operating Expenses  Consumer Lending Segment
Operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment include costs incurred to originate Private Education Loans and to service and collect on our Private Education Loan portfolio. The decreases in operating expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were primarily the result of our cost cutting initiatives. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring-related asset impairments, were 88 basis points and 108 basis points of average Private Education Loans in the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 86 basis points and 97 basis points of average Private Education Loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Business Services Segment
The following tables include "Core Earnings" results for our Business Services segment.
 
Our Business Services segment earns intercompany loan servicing fees from servicing the FFELP Loans in our FFELP Loans segment. The average balance of this portfolio was $140 billion and $133 billion for the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and $142 billion and $133 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in intercompany loan servicing revenue from the year-ago periods is primarily the result of the acquisition of the $25 billion FFELP Loan portfolio on December 31, 2010 which was partially offset by the amortization of the underlying portfolio as well as the FFELP Loans sold to ED as part of the Participation Program in 2010.
We are servicing approximately 3.4 million accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of September 30, 2011. Third-party loan servicing fees in the third quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010 included $16 million and $10 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the ED Servicing Contract. Our allocation of loans awarded for servicing under the ED contract increased from 22 percent to 26 percent for the contract year ending August 2012. The increase was driven primarily by our top ranking for default prevention performance results.
 
 
The decrease in Guarantor servicing revenue compared with the year-ago quarter and nine-month period was primarily due to 2010 legislation that eliminated the origination of new FFELP Loans, thereby eliminating Guarantor issuance fees on new FFELP Loans. Outstanding FFELP Loans on which we earn additional fees also declined.
Other servicing revenue includes account asset servicing revenue and Campus Solutions revenue. Account asset servicing revenue represents fees earned on program management, transfer and servicing agent services and administration services for our various 529 college-savings plans. Assets under administration in our 529 college savings plans totaled $34.5 billion as of September 30, 2011, a 28 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. Campus Solutions revenue is earned from our Campus Solutions business whose services include comprehensive financing and transaction processing solutions that we provide to college financial aid offices and students to streamline the financial aid process.
The following table presents the outstanding inventory of contingent collections receivables that our Business Services segment will collect on behalf of others.
 
Other Business Services revenue is primarily transaction fees that are earned in conjunction with our rewards program from participating companies based on member purchase activity, either online or in stores, depending on the contractual arrangement with the participating company. Typically, a percentage of the purchase price of the consumer members' eligible purchases with participating companies is set aside in an account maintained by us on behalf of our members.
Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 78 percent of total segment revenues for both of the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 78 percent and 79 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
On September 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of SC Services & Associates, Inc., a provider of collections services to local governments and courts for delinquent traffic citations, court fees and probation fines. This acquisition will enhance and complement our other contingency collection businesses.
Operating Expenses  Business Services Segment
Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 decreased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, primarily as a result of our cost cutting initiatives. Included in operating expenses for the first nine months of 2011 is approximately $33 million in third-party servicing costs associated with our acquisition of $25 billion in loans at the end of 2010. During third-quarter 2011, we began transitioning these loans to our own servicing platform and completed the transfer in October 2011. With the portfolio fully transitioned, the future servicing costs associated with these loans will decline significantly.
 
Other Segment
The following table includes "Core Earnings" results of our Other segment.
 
Purchased Paper Business
Our Purchased Paper businesses are presented as discontinued operations for the current and prior periods (see "Consolidated Earnings Summary  GAAP-basis" for a further discussion). We sold our Purchased Paper  Non-Mortgage business, resulting in a $35 million gain in the third quarter of 2011.
Gains on Debt Repurchases
We began repurchasing our outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008. We repurchased $9 million and $882 million face amount of our senior unsecured notes for the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $894 million and $3.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Overhead
Corporate overhead is comprised of costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and stock option expense. Unallocated information technology costs are related to infrastructure and operations.
The increase in corporate overhead for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared with the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 was primarily the result of $15 million of additional expense related to the anticipated termination of our defined benefit pension plan due to changes in estimates related to the employee termination benefits as well as changes in interest rates.
The increase in corporate overhead for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared with the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, was primarily the result of a change in the terms of our stock compensation plans, additional expense related to the anticipated termination of our defined benefit pension plan, and restructuring-related consulting expenses incurred in the first half of 2011. In the first quarter of 2011, we changed our stock compensation plans so that retirement eligible employees would not forfeit unvested stock compensation upon their retirement. This change had the effect of accelerating the future stock compensation expenses associated with these unvested stock grants into the current period for those retirement-eligible employees.
Financial Condition
This section provides additional information regarding the changes related to our loan portfolio assets and related liabilities as well as credit performance indicators related to our Consumer Lending portfolio.
Subsequent to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, our GAAP and "Core Earnings" loan portfolios are identical, as all of our securitization trusts are treated as on-balance sheet for GAAP now. Hence, in referencing the total loan portfolio, ending and average loan balances, provisions for loan losses and charge-offs, we no longer distinguish between the two as they are the same, unless otherwise noted.

The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for Private Education Loan losses for the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
The following table provides detail for the traditional and non-traditional Private Education Loans at September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010.
 
 
 
As part of concluding on the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss, we review key allowance and loan metrics. The most significant of these metrics considered are the allowance coverage of charge-offs ratio; the allowance as a percentage of total loans and of loans in repayment; and delinquency and forbearance percentages.
 
The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). As indicated in the tables, the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At September 30, 2011, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were 6.6 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for less than 25 months. The percentage drops to 1.4 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for more than 48 months. Approximately 80 percent of our Private Education Loans in forbearance status has been in active repayment status less than 25 months.
 
 
 
In 2009, we reduced the amount of time a loan will spend in forbearance, thereby increasing our ongoing contact with the borrower to encourage consistent repayment behavior once the loan is returned to a current repayment status. As a result, the balance of loans in a forbearance status as of month-end has decreased since 2008. The monthly average number of loans granted forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance increased to 5.3 percent in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the year-ago quarter of 5.1 percent. As of September 30, 2011, 3.0 percent of loans in current status were delinquent as of the end of the prior month, but were granted a forbearance that made them current as of September 30, 2011 (borrowers made payments on approximately 21 percent of these loans immediately prior to being granted forbearance).
Receivable for Partially Charged-Off Private Education Loans
At the end of each month, for loans that are 212 days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance. Actual recoveries are applied against the remaining loan balance that was not charged off. We refer to this remaining loan balance as the "receivable for partially charged-off loans." If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is immediately charged off through the allowance for loan losses with an offsetting reduction in the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for Private Education Loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered. There was $143 million in provision for Private Education Loan losses recorded in the quarter to reflect possible additional future charge-offs related to the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans (see "Consumer Lending Segment  Private Education Loans Provision for Loan Losses and Charge-Offs" for a further discussion).
 
The following table summarizes the activity in the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans for the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Recent market volatility has elevated the potential cost of capital markets issuance. Regardless, we continue to expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the origination of new Private Education Loans and the repayment of $3.6 billion of senior unsecured notes to mature in the next twelve months, primarily through our current cash and investment position and the collection of additional bank deposits, the very predictable operating cash flows provided by earnings and repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets, distributions from our securitization trusts (including servicing fees which are priority payments within the trusts). We may also draw down on FFELP ABCP Facilities and the facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank in Des Moines (the "FHLB-DM Facility"); and we may also issue term ABS and unsecured debt.
Currently, new Private Education Loan originations are initially funded through deposits and subsequently securitized to term on a programmatic basis. We have $1.1 billion of cash at the Bank as of September 30, 2011 available to fund future originations.
 
Sources of Liquidity and Available Capacity
The following tables detail our main sources of primary liquidity and our main sources of secondary liquidity (unused secured credit facilities contingent upon obtaining eligible collateral) outstanding at September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and the average balances for the three months ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the assets listed in the table above, we hold a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans and other assets. At September 30, 2011, we had a total of $21.7 billion of unencumbered assets (which includes the assets that comprise our primary liquidity and are available to serve as collateral for our secondary liquidity), excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles. Total student loans, net, comprised $12.0 billion of our unencumbered assets of which $11.0 billion and $1.0 billion related to Private Education Loans, net and FFELP Loans, net, respectively.
The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total tangible equity.
 
 
"Core Earnings" Basis Borrowings
The following table presents the ending balances of our "Core Earnings" basis borrowings at September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2010.
 
 
 
 
Transactions during the Third-Quarter 2011
We repurchase our outstanding unsecured debt in both open-market repurchases and public tender offers. Repurchasing debt helps us to better manage our short-term and long-term funding needs by utilizing current excess liquidity to reduce future obligations related to our unsecured borrowings at favorable pricing. In the third quarter of 2011, we repurchased $9 million face amount of our senior unsecured notes in the aggregate, with maturity dates from 2011.
In the third-quarter 2011, we paid $144 million to repurchase 9.5 million common shares on the open market as part of our previously announced $300 million share repurchase program authorization. We have fully utilized the entire amount of this authorization, acquiring a total amount of 19.1 million shares for $300 million. We declared and paid a $.10 per share dividend during the third quarter of 2011.
Recent Fourth-Quarter 2011 Transactions
On October 5, 2011, the Company closed on a $3.4 billion asset-backed commercial paper facility which matures in January 2014. This facility will provide, subject to certain conditions, the financing to call the 2009-B and 2009-C Private Education Loan trust securities. The securities are first callable in November 2011 and January 2012, respectively. The cost of borrowing under the facility is expected to be commercial paper issuance cost plus 1.10 percent, excluding up-front commitment and unused fees.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standard  Troubled Debt Restructurings
On July 1, 2011, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-02, Receivables (Topic 310), "A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring." This new guidance clarifies when a loan restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring. In applying the new guidance we have determined that certain Private Education Loans for which we have granted forbearance of greater than three months are troubled debt restructurings. If a loan meets the criteria for troubled debt accounting then an allowance for loan loss is established which represents the present value of the losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of the loan. This accounting results in a higher allowance for loan losses than our previously established allowance for these loans as our previous allowance for these loans represented an estimate of charge-offs expected to occur over the next two years (two years being our loss confirmation period). The new accounting guidance was effective as of July 1, 2011 but was required to be applied retrospectively to January 1, 2011. This resulted in $124 million of additional provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2011 from approximately $3.8 billion of student loans being classified as troubled debt restructurings. This new accounting guidance is only applied to certain borrowers who use their fourth or greater month of forbearance during the time period this new guidance is effective. This new accounting guidance has the effect of accelerating the recognition of expected losses related to our Private Education Loan portfolio. The increase in the provision for losses as a result of this new accounting guidance does not reflect a decrease in credit expectations of the portfolio or an increase in the expected life of loan losses related to this portfolio. We believe forbearance is an accepted and effective collections and risk management tool for private student loans (see "Financial Condition  Consumer Lending Portfolio Performance  Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses" for a further discussion). As a result, we expect to have additional loans treated as troubled debt restructurings in the future.
