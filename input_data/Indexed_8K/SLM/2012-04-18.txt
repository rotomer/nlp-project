Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 18, 2012, SLM Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) .
Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
  Sallie Mae (NASDAQ: SLM), formally SLM Corporation, today released first-quarter 2012 financial results that include a 23-percent increase in private education loan originations as compared with the first-quarter 2011. The company also reported that private education loan charge-offs fell to 2.96 percent, the lowest rate since third-quarter 2008.
NEWARK, Del., April 18, 2012
"This quarter's results continue a trend of earnings growth and credit quality improvement," said Albert L. Lord, vice chairman and CEO. "The success of our customers continues to drive our business, and business is better."
For the first-quarter 2012, GAAP net income was $112 million ($.21 per diluted share), compared with $175 million ($.32 per diluted share) for the year-ago quarter.
Core earnings for the quarter were $284 million ($.55 per diluted share), compared with $260 million ($.48 per diluted share) in the year-ago period. The improvement in core earnings was primarily the result of a $50 million decline in loan loss provision and a $40 million decrease in expenses offset by a $40 million net interest income reduction and a $27 million decline in debt repurchase gains. The company provides results on a core earnings basis because management utilizes this information in making management decisions.
The changes in GAAP net income are driven by the same core earnings items discussed above as well as changes in "mark-to-market" unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and amortization and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that are recognized in GAAP, but not in core earnings, results. First-quarter 2012 results had a $131 million increase in unrealized "mark-to-market" losses on derivative contracts compared with the year-ago period.
Consumer Lending
In the consumer lending segment, Sallie Mae originates, finances and services private education loans.
Consumer lending core earnings for the quarter were $81 million, compared with $44 million in the first-quarter 2011. This improvement was primarily the result of reduced loan loss provision. Loan delinquency and charge-off rates improved significantly from the year-ago quarter. The first-quarter charge-off rate of 2.96 percent is the lowest charge-off rate on these loans since third-quarter 2008.
Private education loan portfolio highlights vs. first-quarter 2011 included:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Business Services
Sallie Mae's business services segment includes fees from servicing, collections and college savings businesses.
Business Services core earnings were $139 million in first-quarter 2012, compared with $132 million in the year-ago quarter.
Sallie Mae provides service to 3.7 million loan customers on behalf of the Department of Education. The company earned $17 million in servicing revenue in the first-quarter 2012 from its Department of Education loan servicing contract, compared with $15 million in the year-ago quarter.
Federally Guaranteed Student Loans (FFELP)
This segment represents earnings from Sallie Mae's amortizing portfolio of federally guaranteed student loans.
FFELP core earnings were $82 million in first-quarter 2012, compared with the year-ago quarter's $109 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower net interest income resulting from the declining balance of the FFELP loan portfolio and an increase in funding costs.
During the first-quarter 2012, the company acquired $906 million of FFELP loans. At March 31, 2012, the company held $136 billion of federally guaranteed student loans compared with $146 billion at March 31, 2011.
Operating Expenses
First-quarter operating expenses were $262 million in 2012, down from $303 million in the year-ago quarter primarily due to the company's ongoing cost-cutting initiatives and lower servicing costs.
Funding and Liquidity
During first-quarter 2012, the company issued $1.6 billion in FFELP asset-backed securities (ABS), $547 million in private education loan ABS and $1.5 billion of unsecured bonds.
Also in the first-quarter, the company amended its FFELP asset-backed commercial paper facility to increase the current amount available to $7.5 billion and extend the final maturity date by one year to Jan. 9, 2015.
Shareholder Distributions
In first-quarter 2012, Sallie Mae increased its regular quarterly common stock dividend to $0.125 per share, up from $0.10 in the prior quarter. In addition, during the first quarter of 2012, the company repurchased 16.7 million shares of common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $268 million. The shares were repurchased under the company's January 2012 share repurchase program that authorizes up to $500 million of share repurchases.
Guidance
The company has not updated its guidance for 2012 results which remains:
 
 
Sallie Mae reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain core earnings performance measures. The difference between the company's core earnings and GAAP results for the periods presented were
 
 
 
the unrealized, mark-to-market gains/losses on derivative contracts and the goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. These items are recognized in GAAP but not in core earnings results. The company provides core earnings measures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding the company's performance and the allocation of corporate resources. In addition, the company's equity investors, credit rating agencies and debt capital providers use these core earnings measures to monitor the company's business performance. See "Core Earnings  Definition and Limitations" for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and core earnings. Given the significant variability of valuations of derivative instruments on expected GAAP net income, the company does not provide a GAAP equivalent for its core earnings per share guidance.
Definitions for capitalized terms in this document can be found in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011 (filed with the SEC on Feb. 27, 2012). Certain reclassifications have been made to the balances as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2011, to be consistent with classifications adopted for 2012, and had no effect on net income, total assets or total liabilities.

Results of Operations
We present the results of operations below on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of our results on a segment basis is not in accordance with GAAP. We have four business segments: Consumer Lending, Business Services, FFELP Loans and Other. Since these segments operate in distinct business environments and we manage and evaluate the financial performance of these segments using non-GAAP financial measures, these segments are presented on a "Core Earnings" basis (see "Core Earnings'  Definition and Limitations").
 
 
 
 
Consolidated Earnings Summary  GAAP-basis
Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2011
For the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, net income was $112 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per common share, and $175 million, or $.32 diluted earnings per common share, respectively. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a $130 million increase in net losses on derivative and hedging activities and an $87 million decline in net interest income, which was partially offset by a $50 million decrease in provisions for loan losses and $41 million of lower expenses.
The primary contributors to each of the identified drivers of changes in net income for the current quarter compared with the year-ago quarter are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Core Earnings"  Definition and Limitations
We prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, we also evaluate our business segments on a basis that differs from GAAP. We refer to this different basis of presentation as "Core Earnings." We provide this "Core Earnings" basis of presentation on a consolidated basis for each business segment because this is what we internally review when making management decisions regarding our performance and how we allocate resources. We also refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies, lenders and investors. Because our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation corresponds to our segment financial presentations, we are required by GAAP to provide "Core Earnings" disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for our business segments.
"Core Earnings" are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP. We use "Core Earnings" to manage each business segment because "Core Earnings" reflect adjustments to GAAP financial results for two items, discussed below, that create significant volatility mostly due to timing factors generally beyond the control of management. Accordingly, we believe that "Core Earnings" provide management with a useful basis from which to better evaluate results from ongoing operations against the business plan or against results from prior periods. Consequently, we disclose this information as we believe it provides investors with additional information
 
regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management. The two items adjusted for in our "Core Earnings" presentations are (1) our use of derivatives instruments to hedge our economic risks that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or do qualify for hedge accounting treatment but result in ineffectiveness and (2) the accounting for goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
While GAAP provides a uniform, comprehensive basis of accounting, for the reasons described above, our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation does not. "Core Earnings" are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider. For example, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our "Core Earnings" are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Accordingly, our "Core Earnings" presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Investors, therefore, may not be able to compare our performance with that of other financial services companies based upon "Core Earnings." "Core Earnings" results are only meant to supplement GAAP results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management, our board of directors, rating agencies, lenders and investors to assess performance.
Specific adjustments that management makes to GAAP results to derive our "Core Earnings" basis of presentation are described in detail in the section titled "Core Earnings'  Definition and Limitations  Differences between Core Earnings' and GAAP" below.
 
The following tables show "Core Earnings" for each business segment and our business as a whole along with the adjustments made to the income/expense items to reconcile the amounts to our reported GAAP results as required by GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP
The following discussion summarizes the differences between "Core Earnings" and GAAP net income (loss) and details each specific adjustment required to reconcile our "Core Earnings" segment presentation to our GAAP earnings.
 
 
The table below quantifies the adjustments we make for derivative accounting.
 
 
 
 
Reclassification of Realized Gains (Losses) on Derivative and Hedging Activities
Derivative accounting requires net settlement income/expense on derivatives and realized gains/losses related to derivative dispositions (collectively referred to as "realized gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities") that do not qualify as hedges to be recorded in a separate income statement line item below net interest income. Under our "Core Earnings" presentation, these gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement line item of the economically hedged item. For our "Core Earnings" net interest margin, this would primarily include: (a) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to our Floor Income Contracts to student loan interest income and (b) reclassifying the net settlement amounts related to certain of our basis swaps to debt interest expense. The table below summarizes the realized losses on derivative and hedging activities and the associated reclassification on a "Core Earnings" basis.
 
 
 
 
Cumulative Impact of Derivative Accounting under GAAP compared to "Core Earnings"
As of March 31, 2012, derivative accounting has reduced GAAP equity by approximately $1.1 billion as a result of approximately $1.1 billion (after tax) of cumulative net unrealized losses recognized for GAAP, but not in "Core Earnings." The following table rolls forward the cumulative impact to GAAP equity due to these unrealized net losses related to derivative accounting.
 
In addition, net Floor premiums received on Floor Income Contracts that have not been amortized into "Core Earnings" as of the respective year-ends are presented in the table below. These net premiums will be recognized in "Core Earnings" in future periods and are presented below net of tax. As of March 31, 2012, the remaining amortization term of the net Floor premiums was approximately 4.25 years.
 
 
 
 
 
Business Segment Earnings Summary  "Core Earnings" Basis
Consumer Lending Segment
The following table shows "Core Earnings" results for our Consumer Lending segment.
 
Consumer Lending Net Interest Margin
The following table shows the Consumer Lending "Core Earnings" net interest margin along with reconciliation to the GAAP-basis Consumer Lending net interest margin before provisions for loan losses.
 
 
 
 
The increase in the "Core Earnings" basis Consumer Lending net interest margin over the year-ago quarter was primarily the result of a benefit from the decline in the average balance of our other asset portfolio. The size of the other asset portfolio, which is primarily securitization trust restricted cash and cash held at Sallie Mae Bank (the "Bank") has decreased significantly. This other asset portfolio earns a negative yield and as a result, when its relative weighting decreases compared to the Private Education Loan portfolio, the overall net interest margin increases.
Private Education Loan Provision for Loan Losses and Charge-Offs
The following table summarizes the total Private Education Loan provision for loan losses and charge-offs.
 
In establishing the allowance for Private Education Loan losses as of March 31, 2012, we considered several factors with respect to our Private Education Loan portfolio. In particular, we continue to see improving credit quality and continuing positive delinquency and charge-off trends in connection with this portfolio. Improving credit quality is seen in higher FICO scores and cosigner rates as well as a more seasoned portfolio compared with the year-ago quarter. The overall delinquency rate has declined to 9.1 percent from 10.4 percent and the charge-off rate has declined to 2.96 percent from 3.94 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Apart from these overall improvements , Private Education Loans that have defaulted between 2008 and 2011 for which we have previously charged off estimated losses have, to varying degrees, not met our post-default recovery expectations to date and may continue not to do so. Our allowance for loan losses takes into account these potential recovery uncertainties.
For a more detailed discussion of our policy for determining the collectability of Private Education Loan and maintaining our allowance for Private Education Loan losses, see "Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesAllowance for Loan Losses" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Other Income  Consumer Lending Segment
Included in other income for the fourth quarter 2011 was a $9 million mark-to-market loss related to classifying $12 million of non-U.S. dollar-denominated student loans as held-for-sale. This $12 million portfolio is our entire non-U.S. dollar-denominated loan portfolio.
Operating Expenses  Consumer Lending Segment
Operating expenses for our Consumer Lending segment include costs incurred to originate Private Education Loans and to service and collect on our Private Education Loan portfolio. The decreases in operating expenses in the quarter ended March 31, 2012 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2011 were primarily the result of our cost-cutting initiatives. Operating expenses were 77 basis points and 90 basis points of average Private Education Loans in the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
Business Services Segment
The following table shows "Core Earnings" results for our Business Services segment.
 
Our Business Services segment earns intercompany loan servicing fees from servicing the FFELP Loans in our FFELP Loans segment. The average balance of this portfolio was $135 billion and $144 billion for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decline in intercompany loan servicing revenue from the year-ago period is primarily the result of a lower outstanding principal balance in the underlying portfolio.
We are servicing approximately 3.7 million accounts under the ED Servicing Contract as of March 31, 2012. Third-party loan servicing fees in the first quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2011 included $17 million and $15 million, respectively, of servicing revenue related to the ED Servicing Contract. Our allocation of loans awarded for servicing under the ED contract increased from 22 percent to 26 percent for the contract year ending August 2012. The increase was driven primarily by our top ranking for default prevention performance results.
The increase in contingency revenue was primarily the result of an increase in collections on defaulted FFELP Loans. The following table presents the outstanding inventory of contingent collections receivables that our Business Services segment will collect on behalf of others. We expect the inventory of contingent collections receivables to decline over time as a result of the elimination of FFELP in July 2010.
 
 
 
Other servicing revenue includes account asset servicing revenue and Campus Solutions revenue. Account asset servicing revenue represents fees earned on program management, transfer and servicing agent services and administration services for 529 college savings plans we service. Assets under administration of 529 college-savings plans totaled $41.3 billion as of March 31, 2012, a 13 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. Campus Solutions revenue is earned from our Campus Solutions business whose services include comprehensive financing and transaction processing solutions that we provide to college financial aid offices and students to streamline the financial aid process.
Other Business Services revenue is primarily transaction fees that are earned in conjunction with our rewards program from participating companies based on member purchase activity, either online or in stores, depending on the contractual arrangement with the participating company. Typically, a percentage of the purchase price of the consumer members' eligible purchases with participating companies is set aside in an account maintained by us on behalf of our members. In fourth-quarter 2011, we terminated our credit card affiliation program with a third-party bank and concurrently entered into an affiliation program with a new bank. In terminating the old program we recognized a $25 million gain which primarily represented prior cash advances we received that were previously recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenues related to services performed on FFELP Loans accounted for 76 percent and 77 percent, respectively, of total segment revenues for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.
Operating Expenses  Business Services Segment
Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 decreased from the quarter ended March 31, 2011, primarily as a result of our cost-cutting initiatives.
FFELP Loans Segment
The following table shows "Core Earnings" results for our FFELP Loans segment.
 
 
FFELP Loans Net Interest Margin
The following table shows the FFELP Loans "Core Earnings" basis net interest margin along with reconciliation to the GAAP-basis FFELP Loans net interest margin.
 
 
 
The decrease in the "Core Earnings" basis FFELP Loans net interest margin of 13 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 compared with the year-ago quarter was primarily the result of a widening of the CP/LIBOR spread resulting in a 6 basis point decline in net interest margin as well as a general increase in our funding costs related to unsecured and ABS debt issuances over the last year.
As of March 31, 2012, our FFELP Loan portfolio totaled approximately $135.9 billion, comprised of $49.5 billion of FFELP Stafford and $86.4 billion of FFELP Consolidation Loans. The weighted-average life of these portfolios is 5.0 years and 9.1 years, respectively, assuming a Constant Prepayment Rate ("CPR") of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
On December 23, 2011, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 into law. This law includes changes that permit FFELP lenders or beneficial holders to change the index on which the Special Allowance Payments ("SAP") are calculated for FFELP Loans first disbursed on or after January 1, 2000. We elected to use the one-month LIBOR rate rather than the CP rate commencing on April 1, 2012 in connection with our entire $128 billion of CP indexed loans. This change will help us to better match lender payments with our financing costs.
During the fourth-quarter 2011, the Administration announced a Special Direct Consolidation Loan Initiative. The initiative provides an incentive to borrowers who have at least one student loan owned by the Department of Education and at least one held by a FFELP lender to consolidate the FFELP lender's loans into the Direct Loan program by providing a 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction on the FFELP loans that are eligible for consolidation. The program is available from January 17, 2012 through June 30, 2012. We currently do not foresee the initiative having a significant impact on our FFELP Loans segment.
 
FFELP Loan Provision for Loan Losses and Charge-Offs
The following table summarizes the FFELP Loan provision for loan losses and charge-offs.
 
Operating Expenses  FFELP Loans
Operating expenses for our FFELP Loans segment primarily include the contractual rates we pay to service loans in term asset-backed securitization trusts or a similar rate if a loan is not in a term financing facility (which is presented as an intercompany charge from the Business Services segment who services the loans), the fees we pay for third-party loan servicing and costs incurred to acquire loans. The intercompany revenue charged from the Business Services segment and included in those amounts was $176 million and $189 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts exceed the actual cost of servicing the loans. Operating expenses were 53 basis points and 54 basis points of average FFELP Loans in the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decline in operating expenses from the prior year quarter was primarily the result of the $10.2 billion reduction in the average outstanding balance of our FFELP Loans portfolio.
 
Other Segment
The following table shows "Core Earnings" results of our Other segment.
 
Net Interest Income (Loss) after Provision for Loan Losses
Net interest income (loss) after provision for loan losses includes net interest income related to our corporate liquidity portfolio as well as net interest income and provision expense related to our mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. The $13 million improvement in the current quarter compared with the prior year quarter was primarily the result of our not recording any provision for loan losses related to our mortgage and consumer loan portfolios in the first quarter of 2012. Each quarter we perform an analysis regarding the adequacy of the loan loss allowance for these portfolios and we determined that at March 31, 2012 no additional allowance for loan losses was required related to this $168 million portfolio.
Gains on Debt Repurchases
We began repurchasing our outstanding debt in 2008. We repurchased $204 million and $825 million face amount of our debt for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Other Income
The fourth quarter of 2011 had $26 million of impairment recorded related to our investments in leveraged leases. The impairment was primarily related to American Airlines filing for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result of their bankruptcy filing we fully impaired our related leveraged lease investments.
 
Overhead
Corporate overhead is comprised of costs related to executive management, the board of directors, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and stock-based compensation expense. Unallocated information technology costs are related to infrastructure and operations.
The decrease in overhead for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2011 was primarily the result of our cost-cutting initiatives as well as an $8 million gain related to the final termination of our defined benefit pension plan.
Financial Condition
This section provides additional information regarding the changes related to our loan portfolio assets and related liabilities as well as credit quality and performance indicators related to our Consumer Lending portfolio.

Allowance for Private Education Loan Losses
The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for Private Education Loan losses.
 
 
 
 
The following table provides detail for our traditional and non-traditional Private Education Loans.
 
 
 
As part of concluding on the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we review key allowance and loan metrics. The most significant of these metrics considered are the allowance coverage of charge-offs ratio; the allowance as a percentage of total loans and of loans in repayment; and delinquency and forbearance percentages.
Receivable for Partially Charged-Off Private Education Loans
At the end of each month, for loans that are 212 days past due, we charge off the estimated loss of a defaulted loan balance. Actual recoveries are applied against the remaining loan balance that was not charged off. We refer to this remaining loan balance as the "receivable for partially charged-off loans." If actual periodic recoveries are less than expected, the difference is immediately charged off through the allowance for loan losses with an offsetting reduction in the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans. If actual periodic recoveries are greater than expected, they will be reflected as a recovery through the allowance for loan losses once the cumulative recovery amount exceeds the cumulative amount originally expected to be recovered.
 
The following table summarizes the activity in the receivable for partially charged-off Private Education Loans.
 
 
 
 
The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). As indicated in the tables, the percentage of loans in forbearance status decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At March 31, 2012, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance were 7.1 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for less than 25 months. The percentage drops to 1.3 percent for loans that have been in active repayment status for more than 48 months. Approximately 79 percent of our Private Education Loans in forbearance status has been in active repayment status less than 25 months.
 
 
The monthly average number of loans granted forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance decreased to 5.2 percent in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the year-ago quarter of 5.4 percent. As of March 31, 2012, 2.5 percent of loans in current status were delinquent as of the end of the prior month, but were granted a forbearance that made them current as of March 31, 2012 (borrowers made payments on approximately 24 percent of these loans immediately prior to being granted forbearance).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the origination of new Private Education Loans and the repayment of $2.2 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in the next twelve months, primarily through our current cash and investment portfolio and the collection of additional bank deposits, the very predictable operating cash flows provided by earnings and repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets and distributions from our securitization trusts (including servicing fees which are priority payments within the trusts). We may also draw down on our FFELP ABCP Facilities and the facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank in Des Moines (the "FHLB-DM Facility"); and we may also issue term ABS and unsecured debt.
 
Currently, new Private Education Loan originations are initially funded through deposits and subsequently securitized to term on a programmatic basis. We have $670 million of cash at the Bank as of March 31, 2012 available to fund future originations. We no longer originate FFELP Loans and therefore no longer have liquidity requirements for new FFELP Loan originations.
The acquisition of loan portfolios may require additional funding. Additionally, it is our intent to refinance, primarily through securitizations, the FFELP Loans that are currently in the ED Conduit Program by its January 2014 maturity date. We currently have $18.5 billion of collateral in the ED Conduit Program. While the assets in this facility can be put to ED at the conclusion of the program thus eliminating a call on our liquidity, we intend to refinance these assets in the term ABS market prior to the facility's expiration. In addition, capacity is maintained in our FFELP ABCP Facility and our FHLB-DM Facility to finance a portion of this collateral should term financing not be achieved or available.
Sources of Liquidity and Available Capacity
The following tables detail our main sources of primary liquidity.
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the sources of primary liquidity listed in the tables above, we may also have liquidity available under secured credit facilities to the extent we have eligible collateral and capacity available. Current borrowing capacity under the FFELP ABCP Facility and FHLB-DM Facility is determined based on each facility's size, current usage and qualifying collateral from the unencumbered FFELP Loans reported as primary liquidity in the tables above. Additional borrowing capacity could be used to fund FFELP Loan portfolio acquisitions and to refinance FFELP Loans used as collateral in the ED Conduit Program Facility. As of March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2011, the maximum amount we could borrow under these facilities was $10.5 billion, $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. For the quarters ended March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2011, the average maximum amount we could borrow under these facilities was $12.1 billion, $11.1 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively. These maximum total amounts we can borrow are contingent upon obtaining eligible collateral. If we use our unencumbered FFELP Loans as collateral to borrow against these facilities, the remaining amount we could borrow is reduced accordingly.
In addition to the sources of primary liquidity listed in the table above, we hold a number of other unencumbered assets, consisting primarily of Private Education Loans and other assets. At March 31, 2012, we had a total of $20.9 billion of unencumbered assets (which includes the assets that comprise our primary liquidity and are available to serve as collateral for our secondary liquidity), excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles. Total unencumbered student loans, net, comprised $12.5 billion of our unencumbered assets of which $11.4 billion and $1.1 billion related to Private Education Loans, net and FFELP Loans, net, respectively.
The following table reconciles encumbered and unencumbered assets and their net impact on total tangible equity.
