Forward-Looking Statements; Non-GAAP Financial Measures
SallieMae SM
The following information is current as of August 6, 2012 (unless otherwise noted) and should be read in connection with SLM Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the 2011 Form 10-K ), the Company's second quarter Form 10-Q and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) .
This Presentation contains forward-looking statements and information based on management's current expectations as of the date of this presentation. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our opinions, beliefs or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties set forth in Item 1A Risk Factors and elsewhere in the 2011 Form 10-K, the Company's second quarter Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the SEC; increases in financing costs; limits on liquidity; increases in costs associated with compliance with laws and regulations; changes in accounting standards and the impact of related changes in significant accounting estimates; any adverse outcomes in any significant litigation to which we are a party; credit risk associated with our exposure to third parties, including counterparties to our derivative transactions; and changes in the terms of student loans and the educational credit marketplace (including changes resulting from new laws and the implementation of existing laws). We could also be affected by, among other things: changes in our funding costs and availability; reductions to our credit ratings or the credit ratings of the United States of America; failures of our operating systems or infrastructure, including those of third-party vendors; damage to our reputation; failures to successfully implement cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives and adverse effects of such initiatives on our business; changes in the demand for educational financing or in financing preferences of lenders, educational institutions, students and their families; changes in law and regulations with respect to the student lending business and financial institutions generally; increased competition from banks and other consumer lenders; the creditworthiness of our customers; changes in the general interest rate environment, including the rate relationships among relevant money-market instruments and those of our earning assets versus our funding arrangements; changes in general economic conditions; and changes in the demand for debt management services. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be incorrect. All forward-looking statements contained in this Presentation are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this Presentation. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations.
The Company reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain core earnings performance measures. The difference between the Company's core earnings and GAAP results for the periods presented were the unrealized, mark-to-market gains/losses on derivative contracts and the goodwill and acquired intangible asset
amortization and impairment. These items are recognized in GAAP but not in core earnings results. The Company provides core earnings measures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding the Company's performance and the allocation of corporate resources. The Company's core earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, see Core Earnings Definition and Limitations in the Company's second quarter Form 10-Q for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and core earnings.

Role of Private Education Loan
Private Education Loan products bridge the funding gap between the cost of a college education and funds available through U.S. Department of Education (ED) programs, grants, and other sources
Estimates for academic year 2011-12 project that 20 million students will enroll in higher education and incur costs of over $436 billion; $7 billion of which is funded by private education loans Assuming Federal Loans and Grants remain constant a 4% increase in the cost of education would result in a $17 billion incremental funding requirement for students and families

Recoveries
SallieMae SM
Recoveries are typically realized over many years as a result of the prevalent use of long-term payment plans
While student loans are generally non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, the proceedings can postpone recoveries until after borrowers emerge from bankruptcy
In 2005, Sallie Mae changed its recovery practices, leading to an increase in overall recoveries and earlier collection of recovered amounts
Loans that defaulted in 1998-2003 had recovery rates of 7 14% five years after default
The 2005 cohort had a recovery rate of 24% six years after default
Recovery experience for more recent cohorts has varied based on economic conditions and the characteristics of defaulted loans
In Q3 2011, Sallie Mae provided additional provision for loan loss to provide for potential uncertainty regarding future recoveries due to continued high unemployment rates; the 27% life-of loan recovery expectation remains in place

Cohort Default Triangles
SallieMae SM
The cohort default triangles featured on subsequent slides are segmented by loan program type, FICO score, co-borrower status, and school type
Terms and calculations used in the cohort default triangles are defined below:
Repayment Year The calendar year loans entered repayment
Disbursed Principal Entering Repayment The amount of principal entering repayment in a given year, based on disbursed principal prior to any interest capitalization
Years in Repayment Measured in years between repayment start date and default date. Zero represents defaults that occurred prior to the start of repayment.
Periodic Defaults Defaulted principal in each Year in Repayment as a percentage of the disbursed principal entering repayment in each Repayment Year
Defaulted principal includes any interest capitalization that occurred prior to default
Defaulted principal is not reduced by any amounts recovered after the loan defaulted
Because the numerator includes capitalized interest while the denominator does not, default rates are higher than if the numerator and denominator both included capitalized interest
Total The sum of Periodic Defaults across Years in Repayment for each Repayment Year
