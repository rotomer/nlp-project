Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. - ------ --------------------------------------------- On June 14, 2002, the Board of Directors of Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on"), upon recommendation of its Audit Committee, dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as its independent accountants and engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP as its independent accountants for 2002. Andersen's reports on Snap-on's consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001, and December 30, 2000, did not contain an adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion or qualification or modification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except for noting a change in accounting principles related to derivatives and accounting for pensions. During the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001, and December 30, 2000, and the subsequent interim period through June 21, 2002, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its reports. During the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001, and December 30, 2000, and the subsequent interim period, there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Snap-on has provided Andersen with a copy of the above foregoing statements. After reasonable efforts, Snap-on has been unable to obtain a letter confirming or denying such statements from Andersen, as the engagement partner and senior manager are no longer employed by Andersen. During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 29, 2001, and December 30, 2000, and the subsequent interim period through June 21, 2002, Snap-on did not consult with Deloitte & Touche LLP regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
