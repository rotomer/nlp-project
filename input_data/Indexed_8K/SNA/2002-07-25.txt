Exhibit 99 Snap-on Reports Improved Second Quarter EPS and Continues to Strengthen Cash Flow and Balance Sheet KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 25, 2002--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a global leader in tools, diagnostics and equipment, announced its second-quarter 2002 results. -- Earnings for the second quarter of 2002 were $30.0 million, or $0.51 per share, compared with $23.3 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2001, before special charges in both years. The earnings increase reflects both sales gains and an improved margin. In the second quarter of 2002, Snap-on had special charges of $1.4 million ($0.8 million after tax or $0.01 per share) for costs associated with previously announced restructuring activities. In 2001, Snap-on incurred special charges of $20.5 million ($14.4 million after tax or $0.25 per share) for restructuring and other non-comparable costs. Net earnings in 2002 were $29.2 million, or $0.50 per share, compared with $8.9 million, or $0.15 per share, in 2001. -- Cash flow from operating activities was $57.0 million in the second quarter compared with $15.4 million in 2001. Free cash flow of $44.6 million for the quarter exceeded net earnings, largely as a result of better working capital management, and was used primarily to reduce debt. As a result, total debt was $450.1 million at the end of the second quarter, down $38.1 million from the end of the first quarter, and debt to capitalization strengthened to 34.6%. Year over year, debt was down $96.4 million, or 17.6%. -- Net sales were $547.2 million in the second quarter of 2002, a 4.1% increase from the $525.6 million in the prior year. Strong sales in Snap-on's U.S. dealer business and a modest gain in international commercial and industrial operations offset the sluggish demand that persists in many North American industrial sectors. Currency translation had a negligible impact on 2002 second-quarter consolidated sales. "Across Snap-on, we are realizing the benefits of our focus on improving operating performance and cash flow, in spite of the soft industrial environment," said Dale F. Elliott, chairman and chief executive officer. "Currently, we see little indication of the expected economic recovery in the industrial sector. However, by concentrating on the business drivers we can influence, Snap-on expects to achieve continued improvements in the second half of 2002, and an enhanced market position longer term." Second Quarter Results In the second quarter of 2002, the increase in net sales to $547.2 million from $525.6 million reflects the solid growth in the U.S. dealer business and the success of new products worldwide, partially offset by continued soft demand in the North American industrial and capital goods marketplace. Earnings increased as a result of the sales gain coupled with an improvement in margin. In addition, in the 2002 second quarter, special charges of $1.4 million ($0.8 million after tax or $0.01 per share) were incurred for costs associated with previously announced restructuring activities. This compares with special charges of $20.5 million ($14.4 million after tax or $0.25 per share) for restructuring and other non-comparable costs (including costs related to the management transition and termination of a European equipment supplier arrangement) incurred in the 2001 second quarter. Net earnings for the second quarter 2002 were $29.2 million, or $0.50 per share, compared with $8.9 million, or $0.15 per share, for the second quarter 2001. The profit margin before net finance income increased to 8.9% of sales in the second quarter 2002 compared with 6.4% in 2001, reflecting a slight gain in gross profit and positive sales leverage on operating expenses, along with the favorable impact from the elimination of $3.8 million of goodwill and other intangible amortization. The second quarter of 2001 also included $6.1 million of special charges related primarily to the termination of a European equipment supplier arrangement. Excluding the impact of these items, the 2001 margin would have been 8.2%. Savings from Snap-on's focus on Operational Fitness activities are largely driving the improvement in margin. Gross profit margin at 45.9% of sales for the quarter increased slightly from 45.8% in the comparable period a year ago. Operating expenses for the quarter declined to 37.1% of sales from 39.2% in the prior-year second quarter (or 38.3% last year before special charges), principally reflecting the positive leverage of higher sales on lower operating expenses. Benefits from Operational Fitness activities, the cessation of amortization, and the elimination of special charges were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with the company's dealer expansion initiative, higher pension costs and increased spending for new products. Snap-on ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangibles at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The adoption of this statement resulted in a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the elimination of $3.8 million ($3.2 million after tax or $0.06 per share) of amortization that was included in 2001 second-quarter operating expenses. Additionally, Snap-on completed the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation in the 2002 second quarter as required by this standard, and the results indicate that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles are not impaired. In the Snap-on Dealer Group, worldwide sales increased 5.1% to $274.6 million from $261.3 million in the comparable prior-year period, reflecting strong sales in U.S. dealer operations. Continued strength in tools and tool storage, the successful launch of new products and the increased service and marketplace coverage being achieved as a result of Snap-on's "More Feet on the Street" dealer expansion initiative, all contributed to the gain. In the quarter, a net increase of 55 dealers was achieved under this program in the U.S. dealer business, primarily through the use of second vans and second franchises, bringing the year-to-date total net increase to 116 dealers. Operating earnings increased 6.2% to $27.5 million from $25.9 million, reflecting the higher sales volume, while the operating margin improved slightly to 10.0% from 9.9% in the prior year. In the Commercial and Industrial Group, sales grew 3.1% in the second quarter to $272.6 million from $264.3 million in the 2001 second quarter, including a 1% benefit from favorable currency translations. Higher sales were achieved in Snap-on's facilitation business, information products, European equipment, and international industrial tool markets. These increases were offset by the continued soft demand in North America for tools and equipment in the industrial and capital goods marketplace. Operating earnings were $21.1 million, a significant increase from $7.5 million a year ago. The operating margin improved to 7.7% from 2.8% a year ago, reflecting benefits from restructuring and Operational Fitness activities, the cessation of goodwill and other intangible amortization, and the elimination of special charges (primarily related to the termination of a European equipment supplier arrangement) that depressed the 2001 second-quarter margin. Net finance income increased $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2002 compared with a year ago. Higher originations from growth in the U.S. dealer business, along with a continued favorable interest-rate environment, contributed to the increase. Improved working capital management drove an increase in inventory turns and trade payables. This reduction in working capital investment, coupled with the higher earnings, generated the strong cash flow compared with the comparable prior-year period. Six Month Results For the first six months of 2002, net sales were $1,057.2 million compared with $1,053.0 million in the first six months of last year. Earnings before special charges and cumulative effects were $55.6 million, or $0.95 per share, compared with $52.7 million, or $0.91 per share, in 2001. Net earnings were $53.7 million, or $0.92 per share, in 2002 compared with $35.8 million, or $0.61 per share, in 2001. Special charges totaled $7.4 million in 2002 compared with $20.5 million in 2001. Additionally, Snap-on ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangibles at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year as prescribed by SFAS No. 142, resulting in a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the elimination of $7.5 million ($6.3 million after tax or $0.11 per share) of amortization that was included in 2001 first-half operating expenses. Six-month net earnings in 2002 also reflects a cumulative effect after-tax gain of $2.8 million, or $0.05 per share, in the first quarter from the recognition of negative goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142. In 2001, the adoption of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," resulted in a cumulative effect after-tax loss of $2.5 million, or $0.05 per share. In the Dealer Group, six-month sales were $530.6 million in 2002 compared with $517.7 million in 2001. Operating earnings increased to $57.5 million in 2002 from $53.8 million a year ago. In the Commercial and Industrial Group, six-month sales were $526.6 million in 2002 compared with $535.3 million in 2001. Operating earnings grew to $28.9 million from $20.8 million a year ago. Outlook While Snap-on has confidence that conditions still favor an economic recovery in the second half of 2002, there are few indications in the current industrial marketplace that an economic recovery is at hand. As a result, management believes the prudent course near term is to maintain a cautious approach to the expected recovery and the potential positive impact on sales demand. Based on this cautious sales outlook and the typical sequential seasonal sales decline, Snap-on expects to earn in the range of $0.45 to $0.50 per share in third-quarter net earnings. This includes the expected negative impact associated with the approximately $1 to $2 million in remaining costs for the completion of previously announced restructuring initiatives. For the balance of the year, Snap-on believes it remains on track to achieve its targeted $40 million in savings and, as previously noted, expects that approximately one-half of these savings will be reinvested to support increased development of innovative new products and other initiatives for profitable growth. A discussion of this announcement will be webcast today at 10 a.m. CDT, and a replay will be available for approximately one week.

In the second quarter of 2001, Snap-on recorded $14.4 million in restructuring and other non-recurring charges, including $6.0 million for restructuring actions and $8.4 million in non-recurring charges. The $6.0 million restructuring charge related to the closure of nine facilities and included $1.1 million for severance associated with the elimination of 98 positions, $4.7 million for non-cancelable lease agreements and related facility asset write-downs, and $0.2 million for other exit costs. The non-recurring charges of $8.4 million represent management transition costs associated with the April 2001 retirement of Snap-on's former president and chief executive officer and the appointment of Dale F. Elliott as successor to this position. Snap-on also recorded non-comparable charges of $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2001, including $1.5 million in cost of goods sold and $4.6 million in operating expenses, primarily related to the termination of a European supplier arrangement. 2. The following supplemental financial data illustrates the impact on Snap-on's results of operations of the special charges incurred by Snap-on during the first six months of 2002 and 2001.

In the first quarter of 2002, Snap-on recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle transition adjustment of $2.8 million, on both a pretax and after-tax basis, from the recognition of negative goodwill as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Snap-on adopted SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year. Snap-on recorded $14.4 million in restructuring and other non-recurring charges in the second quarter of 2001, including $6.0 million for restructuring actions and $8.4 million in non-recurring charges. The $6.0 million restructuring charge related to the closure of nine facilities and included $1.1 million for severance associated with the elimination of 98 positions, $4.7 million for non-cancelable lease agreements and related facility asset write-downs, and $0.2 million for other exit costs. The non-recurring charges of $8.4 million represent management transition costs associated with the April 2001 retirement of Snap-on's former president and chief executive officer and the appointment of Dale F. Elliott as successor to this position. Snap-on also recorded non-comparable charges of $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2001, including $1.5 million in cost of goods sold and $4.6 million in operating expenses, primarily related to the termination of a European supplier arrangement. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," Snap-on recorded a transition adjustment at the beginning of its 2001 fiscal year to recognize its derivative instruments at fair value and to recognize the difference between the carrying values and fair values of related hedged assets upon adoption. The cumulative effect of this transition adjustment was to decrease reported net earnings in the first quarter of 2001 by $2.5 million after tax related to a hedge strategy that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. 3. Snap-on adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year. Snap-on completed the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation required by this standard during the second quarter of 2002, the results of which indicate that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles are not impaired. Snap-on recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle transition adjustment that increased net earnings in the first quarter of 2002 by $2.8 million, on both a pretax and after-tax basis, from the recognition of negative goodwill as prescribed by SFAS No. 142. Snap-on ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangibles at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year as required by SFAS No. 142. The following is a reconciliation of earnings before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net earnings and earnings per share for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001, reflecting the impact of this standard on prior-year reported results.
