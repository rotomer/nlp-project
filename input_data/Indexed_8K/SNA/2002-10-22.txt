EXHIBIT 99 Snap-on Third Quarter EPS in Line with Recent Outlook; Strong Cash Flow Continues from Operational Fitness Improvements KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2002--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), a global leader in tools, diagnostics and equipment, announced third-quarter 2002 results, in line with the outlook provided in early September. -- Net earnings for the third quarter of 2002 were $19.2 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with $0.6 million, or $0.01 per share, in 2001. In the third quarter of 2002, Snap-on had restructuring and other non-recurring charges of $1.6 million ($1.1 million after tax or $0.02 per share) for costs associated with previously announced restructuring activities. In the third quarter of 2001, Snap-on incurred special charges of $34.4 million ($23.3 million after tax or $0.40 per share) for restructuring and other non-comparable costs. Earnings before special charges in 2002 were $20.3 million, or $0.35 per share, compared with $23.9 million, or $0.41 per share, in 2001. -- Cash flow from operating activities was $63.4 million in the third quarter of 2002 compared with $48.2 million in 2001. Free cash flow of $52.4 million in the quarter exceeded net earnings, largely as a result of better working capital management, and was used primarily to reduce debt. As a result, total debt was $407.8 million at the end of the third quarter, down $42.3 million from the end of the second quarter. Total debt to total capital strengthened to 32.5%, attaining the company's targeted level of 30-35%. Year over year, debt decreased $124.8 million or 23.4%. -- Net sales were $502.4 million in the third quarter of 2002, a 1.1% decrease from the $508.1 million during the same quarter the prior year. Currency translation had a 2% favorable impact on net sales in the quarter. "Operating earnings and margins were disappointing in the quarter, primarily due to lower volume and its related effects, as well as the higher costs to drive our Profitable Growth initiatives. We are continuing to take actions where economic weakness has slowed product demand, the impact of which has led to near-term margin pressure," said Dale F. Elliott, chairman and chief executive officer. "Snap-on is realizing the expected savings from Operational Fitness activities taken during the past year, and we are continuing to aggressively address those factors that are temporarily depressing results." Third Quarter Results In the third quarter of 2002, net sales declined to $502.4 million from $508.1 million during the same quarter the previous year. Lower sales in the Snap-on Dealer Group offset higher sales in the Commercial and Industrial Group. "We are assisting dealers - our strategic partners - in better managing their working capital through enhanced business training," said Elliott. "A short-term consequence has been lower year-over-year sales to our dealers, as they actively work to reduce their inventory levels. However, market demand has remained strong, as U.S. dealer sales to end-users increased at a mid-single digit percent rate over the prior year." In the Commercial and Industrial Group, favorable currency translation accounted for most of the sales gain, while overall demand for big-ticket products and for tools in the industrial marketplace largely remained flat. Net earnings for the third quarter of 2002 were $19.2 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with $0.6 million, or $0.01 per share, for the third quarter of 2001. The increase in net earnings reflects lower special charges in 2002, benefits from Snap-on's restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, the elimination of goodwill and certain other intangible amortization, higher net finance income and lower interest expense. Excluding the impact of special charges, these improvements were offset by unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption, increased pension and bad debt expense, and continued higher spending for new product development and the company's "More Feet on the Street" dealer expansion and enhancement initiative. In the 2002 third quarter, special charges of $1.6 million ($1.1 million after tax or $0.02 per share) were incurred for previously announced restructuring activities. This compares with special charges of $34.4 million ($23.3 million after tax or $0.40 per share) for restructuring and other non-comparable costs incurred in the 2001 third quarter. Snap-on ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangibles at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The adoption of this statement resulted in a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the elimination of $3.8 million ($3.2 million after tax or $0.05 per share) of amortization that was included in 2001 third-quarter operating expenses. In the Snap-on Dealer Group, worldwide sales decreased 7.6% to $240.0 million in the third quarter of 2002 from $259.6 million in the comparable prior-year period, reflecting a decline in equipment sales through the tech rep organization and lower sales to U.S. dealers, as they reduced inventory levels. While sales to franchised dealers declined in the quarter, end-user demand remained strong. Overall dealer sales of tools, handheld diagnostics products and tool storage to end-users - automotive technicians and mechanics - increased at a mid-single digit percent rate over the comparable period of 2001. The leaner inventory position of dealers, largely due to the strong sell-through of products, reflects Snap-on's continued focus on enhancing the business proposition for its franchised dealers under the More Feet on the Street dealer expansion and enhancement initiative. In the quarter, a net increase of 28 dealers was achieved under this program in the U.S. dealer business, primarily through the growth of second vans and second franchises. This brings the year-to-date total net increase to 144 dealers in the U.S. business. Operating earnings declined to $11.6 million in the 2002 third quarter compared with $30.3 million a year ago, reflecting the lower sales volume and its related margin effects, higher pension and bad debt expense and higher costs from the More Feet on the Street program. In the Commercial and Industrial Group, sales grew 5.6% in the third quarter to $262.4 million from $248.5 million in the 2001 third quarter, including a 4% benefit from favorable currency translation. Higher sales were achieved in Snap-on's facilitation, information products and international industrial tool operations. These increases were offset by continued soft demand in North America for tools and equipment in the industrial and capital goods marketplace. Operating earnings were $19.0 million, a significant increase from $5.5 million a year ago. The operating margin improved to 7.3% of sales from 2.2% a year ago, reflecting benefits from restructuring and Operational Fitness activities, the elimination of goodwill and certain other intangible amortization, and the absence of special charges that depressed the 2001 third-quarter margin. Net finance income increased $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2002 compared with a year ago. Higher credit originations, related to the U.S. dealer business and the continued strong end-user demand, along with a favorable interest-rate environment, contributed to the increase. Strong cash flow, exceeding net income in the quarter, was achieved through a reduction in working capital. As a percent of net sales, working capital improved to 27.5% in the 2002 third quarter from 32.3% in the third quarter of 2001. Working investment (accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) turnover increased to 2.4 turns from 2.2 turns in the year-ago period, progressing towards the 4.0 turns target for 2005. Nine Month Results For the nine months of 2002, net sales were $1,559.6 million compared with $1,561.1 million in the first nine months of last year. Net earnings were $72.9 million, or $1.25 per share, in 2002 compared with $36.4 million, or $0.62 per share, in 2001. Before special charges and cumulative effects in both years, earnings in 2002 were $75.9 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with $76.6 million, or $1.32 per share, in 2001. Special charges totaled $9.0 million ($5.8 million after tax or $0.10 per share) in 2002 compared with $54.9 million ($37.7 million after tax or $0.65 per share) in 2001. Additionally, Snap-on ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangibles at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year as prescribed by SFAS No. 142, resulting in a favorable year-over-year comparison due to the elimination of $11.3 million ($9.5 million after tax or $0.16 per share) of amortization that was included in 2001 nine-month operating expenses. Nine-month net earnings in 2002 also reflect a cumulative effect after-tax gain of $2.8 million, or $0.05 per share, in the first quarter from the recognition of negative goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142. In 2001, the adoption of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," resulted in a cumulative effect after-tax loss of $2.5 million, or $0.05 per share. In the Dealer Group, nine-month sales were $770.6 million in 2002 compared with $777.3 million in 2001. Operating earnings were $69.1 million in 2002 compared with $84.1 million a year ago. In the Commercial and Industrial Group, nine-month sales were $789.0 million in 2002 compared with $783.8 million in 2001. Operating earnings grew to $47.9 million from $26.3 million a year ago. Net finance income for the nine months was $26.4 million in 2002 compared with $27.7 million in 2001. Outlook Snap-on expects no improvement in the general worldwide economic environment for the remainder of 2002, and currently sees little indication for improvement early in 2003. "Despite the difficult conditions, we are encouraged by the progress we are making on a number of our key priorities within the business," said Elliott. Based on the general economic outlook and the typical sequential seasonal sales increase in the fourth quarter, Snap-on expects its earnings to be consistent with the current range of analyst estimates for the fourth quarter of 2002, which is $0.50 to $0.56 per share.

Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2002 include $2.6 million of bad debt expense for the write-down of a receivable related to the closure of auto service centers associated with a major retailer's bankruptcy. In the first quarter of 2002, Snap-on recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle transition adjustment of $2.8 million, on both a pretax and after-tax basis, from the recognition of negative goodwill as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Snap-on adopted SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year. Snap-on recorded $32.4 million in restructuring and other non-recurring charges in the first nine months of 2001, including $24.0 million for restructuring actions and $8.4 million in non-recurring charges. The $24.0 million restructuring charge related to the closure of 26 facilities and included $13.5 million for severance costs associated with the elimination of 456 positions, $9.5 million for non-cancelable lease agreements and related facility asset write-downs, $0.5 million for legal and professional services, and $0.5 million for other exit costs. The non-recurring charges of $8.4 million represent management transition costs associated with the April 2001 retirement of Snap-on's former president and chief executive officer and the appointment of Dale F. Elliott as successor to this position. Snap-on recorded additional charges of $22.5 million in the first nine months of 2001, including non-recurring charges of $12.4 million and non-comparable charges of $10.1 million. The non-recurring charges of $12.4 million (included in cost of goods sold) were for inventory write-downs and warranty costs associated with restructuring activities and the exit of an unprofitable segment of the emissions-testing business. The $10.1 million of non-comparable charges included $1.5 million in cost of goods sold and $8.6 million in operating expenses, primarily related to the termination of a European supplier arrangement and for emissions-related bad debts. SNAP-ON INCORPORATED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," Snap-on recorded a transition adjustment at the beginning of its 2001 fiscal year to recognize its derivative instruments at fair value and to recognize the difference between the carrying values and fair values of related hedged assets upon adoption. The cumulative effect of this transition adjustment was to decrease reported net earnings in the first quarter of 2001 by $2.5 million after tax related to a hedge strategy that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. 2. Snap-on adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year. Snap-on completed the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation required by this standard during the second quarter of 2002, the results of which indicated that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles were not impaired. Snap-on recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle transition adjustment that increased net earnings in the first quarter of 2002 by $2.8 million, on both a pretax and after-tax basis, from the recognition of negative goodwill as prescribed by SFAS No. 142. Snap-on ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangibles at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year as required by SFAS No. 142. The following is a reconciliation of earnings before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net earnings and earnings per share for the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2001, reflecting the impact of this standard on prior-year reported results.
