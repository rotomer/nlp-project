EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ------------ 99 Press Release of Snap-on Incorporated, dated February 4, 2004 entitled "Snap-on Reports $0.30 EPS for Fourth-quarter 2003 and $1.35 EPS for Full-year 2003; Results in line with recent estimates." 4

Exhibit 99 Snap-on Reports $0.30 EPS for Fourth-Quarter 2003 and $1.35 EPS for Full-Year 2003; Results in line with recent estimates KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 4, 2004--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a global leader in tools, diagnostics and equipment, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal full year ended January 3, 2004, that were in line with the company's recent estimates announced on January 21, 2004. -- Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $17.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, on $599.3 million in sales. For the year-ago period, net earnings were $33.1 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, on $549.5 million of sales. -- Earnings in the fourth quarter, as previously disclosed, were adversely impacted by higher costs from an accelerated implementation of continuous improvement actions, lagging improvements in the company's economically sensitive businesses, particularly its equipment businesses, and certain other factors affecting the comparisons, including higher pension expense. Snap-on's worldwide equipment business reported a $6 million decline in operating income year over year, related primarily to its North American collision repair business. -- Cash flow from operating activities was $37.0 million in the 2003 fourth quarter, after a voluntary pension contribution of $78.2 million. Free cash flow, comprising cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures of $10.7 million, was $26.3 million. As previously announced, Snap-on expects to accelerate its planned 2004 share repurchases, and repurchase approximately 750,000 to 1 million shares. -- Net earnings for the full-year 2003 were $78.7 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, on $2.23 billion in sales. For the year-ago period, net earnings were $106.0 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, on $2.11 billion of sales. Of the 2003 sales increase, $111.8 million resulted from currency translation. Cash flow from operating activities was $177.0 million, after $95.2 million in pension contributions made during 2003. -- As previously announced, Snap-on expects increased profitability and growth in 2004. Signs of improving business conditions in certain of the company's end-markets began to appear late in the fourth quarter of 2003. Additionally, the company expects that actions taken during the past year will lead to stronger operating margins going forward, resulting in expected earnings of $1.80 to $2.20 per diluted share for full-year 2004. Fourth Quarter Results Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $17.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, on $599.3 million in sales. For the year-ago period, net earnings were $33.1 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, on $549.5 million of sales. Currency translation contributed $33.4 million of the 2003 sales increase. The total net currency impact on earnings, however, was a negative $2 million pretax year over year, primarily due to the adverse margin effects from products manufactured in Canada and Sweden. During the 2003 fourth quarter, notable operating success was achieved year over year in increasing working investment turnover and, in particular, inventory turns. However, earnings and operating margin comparisons were impacted by: -- Poor performance in the company's equipment businesses in the Commercial and Industrial Group, particularly a market softness in sales of collision repair equipment, which resulted in an approximate $6 million decline in operating income; -- Higher costs year over year of $12 million pretax for expenses associated with continuous improvement actions to enhance performance, including approximately $6 million in expenses related to the previously announced closing of two U.S. hand-tool plants and $4 million for the closure of a large-platform diagnostics facility; and -- Higher pension, other retirement and insurance costs of $6 million pretax. The 2002 fourth quarter included a $4.6 million pretax benefit, or $0.05 per diluted share, largely from the favorable resolution of a patent infringement matter net of provisions for certain other contractual matters. Segment Results In the Snap-on Dealer Group segment, operating earnings were $14.8 million on total net sales of $275.4 million for fourth-quarter 2003, compared with $25.0 million of operating earnings on $263.8 million of sales in fourth-quarter 2002. Of the total worldwide sales increase, $8.9 million resulted from currency translation. In North America, the Snap-on franchised dealer business grew 2% in sales volume, with continued softness being experienced in sales of large, platform-based diagnostics sold through the "tech rep" organization. As reported by U.S. Snap-on franchised dealers, sales to their customers were particularly strong, increasing at a high-single-digit rate for the fourth quarter of 2003. This improvement is estimated to have largely resulted from improved market penetration, as a result of dealer expansions through second vans, reaching new customers and being better able to serve existing customers. However, efforts by North American dealers in strengthening their fiscal health through improved working investment turnover had a dampening impact on sales by Snap-on to its dealers. For the fourth quarter of 2003, operating earnings improvements from the increase in 2003 sales, the benefits of ongoing cost reductions and $3 million of benefit associated with the reduction in LIFO-valued inventories were more than offset by $5 million of plant closure costs and approximately $1 million in higher expenses due to production inefficiencies and other expenses associated with the relocation of production from the two hand-tool plants, which are anticipated to be closed by April 2004. In addition, there were $3 million of higher year-over-year pension, other retirement and insurance costs and $4 million of higher freight and catalog expenses. In 2002, fourth-quarter results included a benefit of $2.5 million related to the aforementioned patent resolution. In the Diagnostics and Information Group segment, operating earnings were $6.0 million on total net sales of $77.2 million for fourth-quarter 2003, compared with $7.6 million of operating earnings on $78.9 million of sales in fourth-quarter 2002. The slight decline in year-over-year sales is principally due to lower intersegment sales. The growth of handheld diagnostics was offset by a market softness in large, platform-based diagnostics (products primarily sold through the Dealer Group's "tech rep" organization) and the impact resulting from the transfer of certain European equipment production to the Commercial and Industrial Group, which reduced intersegment sales for these products. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003 include approximately $4 million of costs largely associated with the closing of the U.S. facility that assembled large-platform diagnostics. Savings from prior restructuring initiatives and other continuous improvement actions, as well as $2 million of gains from sales of facilities, largely offset the costs associated with this facility closure. Fourth-quarter 2002 included a $1.9 million benefit from the reversal of excess restructuring reserves. In the Commercial and Industrial Group segment, operating earnings were $2.4 million on total net sales of $314.3 million for fourth-quarter 2003, compared with $17.4 million of operating earnings on $275.6 million of sales in fourth-quarter 2002. Of the total worldwide sales increase, $24.1 million resulted from currency translation. Weak economic conditions in Europe and, at the beginning of the quarter in North America, continued to impact the sale of equipment to vehicle repair shops and the sale of industrial tools in such sectors as aerospace and aviation, general manufacturing and non-residential construction. These declines were partially offset by revenue growth in the company's facilitation business for new vehicle dealerships and an improving sales trend for industrial tools in North America that began late in the quarter in certain sectors. In the fourth quarter of 2003, profitability improvements from prior restructuring activities were more than offset by the combined margin impact of lower volumes in certain businesses, particularly in the Group's worldwide equipment businesses. These equipment businesses represented a $6 million decline in operating earnings, primarily related to the collision repair business in North America. Additional factors that contributed to the lower fourth-quarter operating earnings year over year were negative net currency effects of $3 million, resulting from the sourcing of a significant portion of the Group's tool and equipment products from Sweden and Canada; $3 million of higher pension, other retirement and insurance costs and $2 million associated with higher manufacturing and inventory reduction-related costs, net of LIFO-inventory benefits realized. In 2002, the fourth quarter included a net benefit of $2.1 million related to the aforementioned patent resolution, net of provisions for certain contractual matters. Cash Flow Cash flow from operating activities was $37.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with $98.3 million in fourth-quarter 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Snap-on made a voluntary pension contribution of $78.2 million and, as a result, Snap-on expects that it will not need to make further contributions to its U.S. plans until 2006, based upon current actuarial assumptions. For the full-year 2003, cash flow from operating activities was $177.0 million compared with $224.1 million in 2002. In 2003, Snap-on made pension contributions totaling $95.2 million compared with $13.1 million in 2002. Free cash flow for 2003, comprising cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures of $29.4 million, was $147.6 million. After payments to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the past year, as well as the funding of pension obligations, free cash flow was used to lower the company's net debt position. The ratio of total net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to total invested capital (total net debt plus shareholders' equity) was 19.0% at fiscal year-end 2003 compared with 29.2% at fiscal year-end 2002, reflecting both a decrease in net debt and an increase in shareholders' equity, including $132 million from currency translation. An important priority for Snap-on in improving its return on capital has been to focus on improving asset utilization; in particular, by making more effective use of investment in working capital. The company's target is to improve working investment (accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) turnover to four turns by the end of 2005. Working investment at the end of 2003 improved to $708.2 million compared with $755.2 million at year-end 2002 (including the negative impact of approximately $81 million in 2003 from currency translation), which equates to 3.2 turns in working investment compared with 2.9 turns at year-end 2002. Inventory turns, an important element in working investment, improved to 3.5 turns at the end of 2003 compared with 2.9 turns a year ago. Outlook As previously announced, Snap-on will continue to emphasize the consistent and widespread application of its Driven to Deliver(TM) strategic framework to reach its targeted financial objectives. The company remains committed to seeking opportunities for process improvements, through the use of "lean" tools, that will enhance competitiveness and customer responsiveness throughout its global organization. Snap-on, as previously disclosed, expects that first-quarter 2004 results will include approximately $15 million in further continuous improvement costs, including approximately $8 million of costs associated with the two aforementioned hand-tool plant closings, in order to maintain its accelerated pace of activity. Lean and continuous improvement activity levels will continue throughout the year, with an estimated additional $8 million to $10 million of related costs expected beyond the first quarter. However, beginning in the second quarter of 2004, Snap-on expects the profit benefits from these, and from prior actions, to begin to exceed such costs; thereby leading to reported net earnings that exceed prior-year levels. For full-year 2004, Snap-on expects continued steady growth in demand for tools and handheld diagnostics by vehicle-service technicians, as well as in the purchase of tools by its dealers. Additionally, with improving signs of economic recovery in North America, Snap-on anticipates it could achieve a modest level of sales improvements in its more cyclical commercial and industrial businesses. Snap-on expects full-year 2004 reported earnings to be in the range of $1.80 to $2.20 per diluted share, including the estimated $0.25 to $0.28 per share in costs for continuous improvement actions.
