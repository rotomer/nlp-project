EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99 Press Release of Snap-on Incorporated, dated April 22, 2004 entitled "Snap-on Announces EPS of $0.22 for First-quarter 2004; Reports strong cash flow from operating activities; Reaffirms 2004 EPS guidance." 4

Exhibit 99.1 Snap-on Announces EPS of $0.22 for First-quarter 2004; Reports strong cash flow from operating activities; Reaffirms 2004 EPS guidance KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 22, 2004--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a global leader in tools, diagnostics and equipment, today announced results for the first quarter of 2004. -- Net earnings for the first quarter of 2004 were $12.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared with $21.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003. -- Earnings in the first quarter of 2004 include $9.9 million of pretax costs related to continuous improvement actions, principally associated with the completed closure of two U.S. hand-tool manufacturing facilities, as well as $4.2 million of costs associated with manufacturing inefficiencies and other variances arising from the transfer of that production to other U.S. plants, or a total of $0.16 per share after tax. -- Total revenue was $616.3 million for the first quarter of 2004 compared with $543.1 million in the prior year. Of the $73.2 million increase, $21.2 million is attributable to the consolidation of Snap-on Credit LLC (previously accounted for under the equity method) and reclassifications related to Snap-on's wholly owned financial services subsidiaries, effective with the beginning of Snap-on's fiscal year 2004. Additionally, $33.2 million of the increased revenue is due to the impact of currency translation. -- Improved worldwide sales of industrial tools and equipment, as well as higher sales to Snap-on's franchised dealers in international markets, contributed to the $18.8 million increase in organic sales volume. Sales in the U.S. dealer operation were essentially flat in the first quarter, while sales recorded by U.S. dealers to their customers increased at a mid-single-digit rate. -- Cash flow from operating activities was $31.2 million in the 2004 first quarter compared with $18.6 million a year ago. Free cash flow, comprising cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures of $7.3 million, was $23.9 million. This compares with free cash flow of $12.4 million, after $6.2 million of capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2003. "Across Snap-on, we are seeing positive results from our concentrated efforts to drive toward a higher level of financial performance in 2004 and beyond," said Dale F. Elliott, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are more confident in our expectation that the increased demand being experienced across our businesses will continue. This increased demand, coupled with our internal focus on improving processes and effectiveness, leads us to believe that this will be the year in which our efforts begin to become more evident on the bottom line." First Quarter Results Total revenue was $616.3 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with $543.1 million in the first quarter of 2003. Total revenue increased $73.2 million, including financial services revenue of $21.2 million from the consolidation of Snap-on Credit LLC (previously accounted for under the equity method) and reclassifications related to Snap-on's wholly owned financial services subsidiaries effective with the beginning of this fiscal year, as a result of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46 and No. 46R. Additionally, $33.2 million of the revenue increase was attributable to currency translation. Organic sales volume increased $18.8 million, or 3.3%, year over year on improved worldwide sales of industrial tools and equipment, as well as improved sales to Snap-on's franchised dealers in international markets. Sales in the U.S. dealer operation were essentially flat year over year in the quarter, while sales reported by U.S. dealers to their customers increased at a mid-single-digit rate. Net earnings were $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2003. Despite the higher sales volume, margins and operating earnings were impacted by $9.9 million of pretax costs related to previously announced continuous improvement actions, of which $7.1 million was associated with the expected closure of two hand-tool facilities, as well as by $4.2 million of pretax costs associated with manufacturing inefficiencies and other variances arising from the transfer of production from those closed facilities to other U.S. hand-tool plants. First-quarter 2003 operating results included $2.5 million of pretax costs for continuous improvement actions. Segment Results In the Snap-on Dealer Group segment, operating earnings were $11.6 million on total net sales of $279.9 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with $23.6 million of operating earnings on $264.9 million of sales in the first quarter of 2003. For the first quarter of 2004, the increased segment operating earnings contribution from the higher sales volume was more than offset by $9.7 million of allocated plant closure costs and higher expenses due to production inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances associated with the relocation of production from the two hand-tool plants, which were closed at the end of March 2004, as planned. Production was consolidated to other existing U.S. hand-tool facilities, maintaining the Snap-on(R) brand's hand-tool legacy of "Made in USA." Segment operating earnings were also affected by $1.9 million for higher freight expense and by $1.3 million for higher marketing and sales expense. In the first quarter of 2003, there were $1.9 million of continuous improvement costs. Of the total worldwide segment sales increase, $9.3 million was from currency translation and $5.7 million resulted from higher organic sales volume. In North America, dealer group sales were essentially flat year over year, while international operations experienced a 13.1% sales volume increase. In the U.S. marketplace, reported sales by Snap-on franchised dealers to their customers continued strong, increasing at a mid-single-digit rate for the first quarter of 2004. This improvement is believed to have come largely from increased market penetration due to dealer expansions through second vans, reaching new customers and being better able to serve existing customers. We believe that dealers are also managing their inventory to lower levels. In the Diagnostics and Information Group segment, operating earnings were $7.6 million on total net sales of $80.3 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared with $2.8 million of operating earnings on $76.4 million of sales in the first quarter of 2003. Segment operating earnings for the first quarter of 2004 largely reflect the growth in sales volume of handheld diagnostics and benefits from prior improvement activities. Operating expenses for the segment were essentially flat, reflecting savings from past cost reduction actions and lower bad debt experience of $0.9 million, offset by the impact of currency translation on operating expenses of foreign operations. Continuous improvement costs in the quarter were essentially flat year over year. The increase in total segment sales includes $3.2 million from currency translation, as well as sales growth of handheld diagnostics and information products, partially offset by the impact from the transfer last year of certain European equipment production to the Commercial and Industrial Group, which reduced intersegment sales for these products. In the Commercial and Industrial Group segment, an operating loss of $3.1 million on total net sales of $309.9 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2004, compared with operating earnings of $6.1 million on $272.7 million of sales in the first quarter of 2003. For the first quarter of 2004, the increased segment operating earnings contribution from the higher sales volume and benefits from prior improvement actions were more than offset by inventory adjustments of $4.6 million, costs for continuous improvement actions worldwide of $2.7 million, as well as $1.6 million of the previously mentioned allocated plant closure costs and related inefficiencies due to the production relocation. In addition, there was $1.5 million of higher year-over-year start-up costs associated with the company's investment to expand its distribution and operating presence in rapidly growing emerging markets, $1.1 million of negative currency impact, and $1.3 million of higher bad debt expense. In the first quarter of 2003, there were $0.6 million of continuous improvement costs. Of the $37.2 million increase in worldwide segment sales, $22.6 million resulted from currency translation and $14.6 million from improved sales volume. The continued improvement in North American industrial demand for tools that began late in the fourth quarter of 2003, as well as better conditions in much of Europe, led to increased sales volume of hand and power tools used in industrial and commercial applications, despite continued weakness in certain sectors such as aerospace and aviation. In addition, higher sales of vehicle-service equipment were achieved in both North America, through direct TAG distribution, and in Europe, along with continued growth in Snap-on's facilitation business for new-vehicle dealerships. As a result of adopting FIN No. 46 and No. 46R, Snap-on is reporting the results of its finance operations as a new business segment, "Financial Services." The Financial Services segment reflects the finance operations of Snap-on, including Snap-on Credit LLC, the company's 50%-owned U.S. joint venture between Snap-on and The CIT Group, Inc., as well as the company's wholly owned credit subsidiaries in those international markets where the company maintains dealer operations. Financial Services revenue was $21.2 million in the first quarter of 2004. Financial Services segment operating earnings were $10.9 million for the first quarter of 2004. Cash Flow Cash flow from operating activities was $31.2 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2003, which included a $10 million pension contribution. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2004, comprising cash flow from operating activities less $7.3 million of capital expenditures, was $23.9 million, compared with $12.4 million for the first quarter of 2003. Capital expenditures increased slightly year over year to $7.3 million from $6.2 million in the prior year. The consolidation of Snap-on Credit LLC did not have a material impact on cash flow. Cash was partially utilized during the first quarter to repurchase 150,000 shares of Snap-on Common Stock for $4.7 million. At the end of first-quarter 2004, cash and cash equivalents was $107.6 million, up from $96.1 million at fiscal year-end 2003. The ratio of total net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to total invested capital (total net debt plus shareholders' equity) was 18.4% at the end of first-quarter 2004, compared with 28.6% at the end of first-quarter 2003 and 19.0% at fiscal year-end 2003. To increase its return on capital, Snap-on is focused on improving asset utilization, in particular, by making more effective use of its investment in working capital. The company's target is to improve working investment (accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) turnover to four turns by the end of 2005. Working investment at the end of the first quarter of 2004 was $711.9 million, compared with $708.2 million at fiscal year-end 2003, which equates to 3.3 turns in working investment compared with 3.2 turns at year-end 2003, and a significant improvement from the 2.9 achieved a year ago. Inventory turns, an important element in working investment, improved to 3.8 turns at the end of first-quarter 2004, compared with 3.5 turns at year-end 2003 and 3.1 turns a year ago. Outlook Snap-on expects to continue to emphasize the application of its Driven to Deliver(TM) strategic framework to reach its targeted financial objectives, including the realization of improved financial returns and sustainable earnings growth. The company remains committed to seeking opportunities for process improvements, through the use of "Lean" business tools, that Snap-on believes will enhance competitiveness and customer responsiveness throughout its global organization. Snap-on estimates that approximately $6 million in continuous improvement costs will be incurred during the second quarter, with an additional $7 million to $8 million of such costs anticipated for the second half of 2004. As previously announced, beginning in the second quarter of 2004, Snap-on expects the profit benefits from its improvement actions to begin to exceed such costs, leading to reported net earnings that exceed prior-year levels. For full-year 2004, Snap-on expects continued steady growth in demand for tools and handheld diagnostics by vehicle-service technicians, as well as in the purchase of tools by its dealers. Additionally, with improving signs of economic recovery, Snap-on anticipates it could achieve a modest level of sales improvements in its more cyclical commercial and industrial businesses. Snap-on reaffirms its expectation for full-year 2004 reported earnings to be in the range of $1.80 to $2.20 per diluted share, including the estimated $0.25 to $0.28 per share in costs for continuous improvement actions.
