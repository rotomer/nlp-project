EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99 Press Release of Snap-on Incorporated, dated July 27, 2005, entitled "Snap-on Announces 2005 Second-quarter Results."

Exhibit 99 Snap-on Announces 2005 Second-quarter Results KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 2005--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), a global leader in professional tools, diagnostics and equipment, today announced 2005 second-quarter results. -- Net earnings for the second quarter of 2005 increased 20% to $26.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with $22.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, a year ago. -- Net sales were essentially flat at $592.4 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $591.3 million in the prior year. Total revenue, which includes financial services, was $608.6 million compared to $612.1 million a year ago. "I am encouraged by the progress being achieved by Snap-on associates in improving our focus on our customers," said Jack D. Michaels, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "I thank them all for their diligent efforts. However, we all know that we still have much work - and opportunity - ahead of us in our drive to improve manufacturing effectiveness, provide an enhanced level of customer service, increase inventory turns and reduce the complexity and cost structure within our organization." Second-quarter Results Net sales were $592.4 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $591.3 million in the second quarter of 2004. Of the $1.1 million increase, $11.9 million was due to currency translation, which offset $10.8 million of lower sales primarily in the U.S. dealer operation, OEM facilitation business and worldwide equipment business, partially offset by higher international dealer sales and worldwide industrial tool sales. Total revenue was $608.6 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $612.1 million in the prior year, reflecting a decline in financial services revenue caused principally by lower credit originations and the impact of higher year-over-year interest rates on Snap-on's domestic financing business. Net earnings were $26.6 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $22.2 million in the second quarter of 2004. Operating earnings improved to $47.3 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $40.8 million a year ago, principally the result of better margins. Operating earnings improved despite the negative effects of higher year-over-year steel costs and a lower earnings contribution from financial services. Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2005 also included $6.8 million of restructuring costs, while the year-ago results included $4.8 million of such costs and a $3.6 million charge associated with the settlement of two GSA contract audits. Segment Results Snap-on Dealer Group operating earnings were $23.4 million on total revenues of $260.6 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $30.0 million of operating earnings on $261.1 million of total revenues in the second quarter of 2004. Segment operating earnings for the second quarter of 2005 were reduced by lower U.S. sales, primarily due to a lower average number of U.S. dealer vans in operation for the quarter, continued high costs associated with improving manufacturing operations and $3.9 million of higher steel costs. These effects were partially offset by higher selling prices and increased international sales. Currency translation increased revenue by $2.9 million, but had minimal effect on operating earnings. Sales to U.S. dealers have been impacted in past periods by plant consolidations and other manufacturing challenges that resulted in low order fill rates and higher levels of backorders. Progress, however, is being made in improving order fill rates and in reducing the level of outstanding backorders, although at a higher level of cost. Actions to enhance manufacturing operations, including installation of new production equipment and machine tooling, improved manufacturing processes, increased equipment maintenance and the acquisition in the 2005 first quarter of a production facility formerly managed by a supplier are beginning to provide greater production benefits and a higher level of "complete and on-time" product deliveries. Substantial effort continues to be focused on these initiatives. As a result of these efforts, along with the continued strength in franchise applications, Snap-on believes that further improvements will contribute to higher sales and lower costs. Commercial and Industrial Group operating earnings improved to $17.9 million on total revenues of $294.8 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with operating earnings of $4.2 million on $282.9 million of total revenues in the second quarter of 2004. Improved gross margins and lower operating expenses were the principal contributors to the earnings gain in 2005. These improvements primarily reflect product cost reduction initiatives, benefits from footprint consolidation, and increased efficiencies associated with continuous improvement activities. These actions, coupled with higher selling prices and the absence of the $3.6 million GSA settlement charge incurred last year, more than offset the $3.9 million of higher year-over-year steel costs and the continued investment spending to support the strategy of establishing a sales presence in Asia and other emerging markets. During the quarter, $2.5 million in restructuring costs were also incurred, primarily for the integration and streamlining of the Bahco and Eurotools operations in Europe, while $3.3 million of such costs were incurred a year ago. Of the $11.9 million increase in total revenue, $8.2 million was due to currency translation and $3.7 million reflects higher sales. Increased sales of hand tools for commercial and industrial applications and higher sales resulting from the successful introduction of new power tools partially offset a decline in vehicle service equipment sales. Diagnostics and Information Group operating earnings were $13.7 million on total revenues of $117.2 million for the second quarter of 2005 compared with $6.8 million of operating earnings on $114.7 million of total revenues in the second quarter of 2004. The increase in total revenue, largely reflecting higher software and handheld Snap-on(R) brand diagnostics sales made through the global dealer business, as well as an improved margin from these higher-margin product sales, combined with benefits from continuous improvement actions contributed to the earnings gain year over year. Lower sales in the OEM facilitation business largely offset the higher diagnostics sales, while currency translation contributed $1.0 million to revenues. Financial Services operating earnings were $5.0 million on $16.2 million of total revenue compared with $9.6 million of operating earnings on $20.8 million of total revenues in the second quarter of 2004. Operating earnings decreased in the second quarter of 2005 principally as a result of higher interest rates coupled with lower credit originations. Corporate general expenses were $12.7 million in the second quarter of 2005, up from $9.8 million a year ago. Savings from cost reduction actions were more than offset by $3.9 million of higher year-over-year pension and postretirement actuarial adjustments and mark-to-market adjustments of $1.2 million on stock-based incentive plans. At the end of the second quarter of 2005, cash and cash equivalents were $130.6 million, a $14.8 million decrease from the first quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting the retirement of $25.0 million of short-term debt during the quarter. Total debt was $311.7 million at the end of the second quarter 2005, down $19.4 million from $331.1 million at the end of the first quarter 2005. Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 23.1% at the end of the second quarter 2005, down from 23.5% at the end of the first quarter 2005 and down from 25.2% a year ago. Outlook Snap-on will continue to emphasize improving its customer service, reducing complexity and cost, strengthening its dealer van franchise system, achieving quicker inventory turns, implementing continuous improvement actions and the development of innovative new products. Further progress toward these objectives is anticipated to lead to improved levels of service and product deliveries to dealers and customers, an expectation of higher sales and further improvements in operating margins. As reported previously at the end of the first quarter of 2005, Snap-on estimates that full-year 2005 restructuring costs will total $20 million to $25 million, of which $14.6 million was incurred in the first six months. Benefits from prior rationalization actions, as well as ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, including the further integration of business operations, are anticipated to exceed the costs associated with those actions and provide future operating leverage from sales activities. "Our ongoing actions are aimed at accelerating the building of long-term shareholder value through improved financial returns and earnings growth," said Michaels. "We continue to believe that by placing urgent emphasis on improved customer responsiveness, and maintaining our strong heritage of product quality, performance and innovation, we can substantially strengthen our brands' global appeal."

The primary changes include the reclassification of Snap-on's Technical Representative support organization from the Snap-on Dealer Group to the Diagnostics and Information Group and the segregation of Snap-on's general corporate expenses from the operating earnings of the business segments. Prior period figures have been restated to reflect these changes.
