EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99 Press Release of Snap-on Incorporated, dated July 25, 2006, entitled "Snap-on Announces 2006 Second-quarter Results; 2nd Quarter EPS of $0.20 includes charge of $0.40 for franchisee litigation; compares to EPS of $0.46 in 2nd Quarter of 2005."

Exhibit 99 Snap-on Announces 2006 Second-quarter Results; 2nd Quarter EPS of $0.20 includes charge of $0.40 for franchisee litigation; compares to EPS of $0.46 in 2nd Quarter of 2005 KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 25, 2006--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), a global leader in professional tools, diagnostics and equipment, today announced second-quarter 2006 results. -- Operating earnings of $20.1 million include a previously disclosed $38.0 million charge to settle franchisee litigation matters. Excluding this settlement charge, operating earnings of $58.1 million, or 9.1% of revenues, were up $10.8 million or 22.8% from last year. (See attached reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release.) -- Net earnings and earnings per share excluding the $38.0 million pretax litigation settlement ($23.4 million after tax or $0.40 per share) were $35.2 million or $0.60 per share, compared with $26.6 million or $0.46 per share a year ago. Net earnings including the settlement were $11.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. -- Net sales increased 5.4% to $624.4 million due primarily to higher North American franchisee sales, increased OEM facilitation sales, increased sales to U.S. commercial and industrial customers, and growth in emerging markets. "We continue to execute on our initiatives to improve customer service and satisfaction, strengthen our brands and improve our global supply chain," said Jack D. Michaels, Snap-on chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our second-quarter performance demonstrates the considerable progress that our associates are making against these strategic priorities and we continue to see substantial long-term opportunity for profitable growth." Snap-on Tools Group operating earnings were $26.5 million for the second quarter of 2006, excluding the litigation settlement charge, on segment sales of $270.8 million. This compares to operating earnings of $23.4 million on segment sales of $260.6 million in the prior year. Operating loss for the second quarter of 2006 including the litigation settlement charge was $11.5 million. Operating earnings as a percentage of sales increased to 9.8% in the second quarter of 2006 compared with 9.0% in 2005, excluding the impact of the litigation settlement in 2006. Higher sales volume and increased pricing, as well as savings and productivity enhancements from rapid continuous improvement actions, were partially offset by $3.0 million of higher year-over-year production and material costs, including steel, and $3.6 million of higher planned spending to support the supply chain and franchise improvement initiatives. "We remain on track with our strategic supply chain, franchise improvement and other key initiatives," said Michaels. Sales in the quarter increased $10.2 million year over year driven by a 3.7% increase in sales in North America and a 4.6% increase in sales to international markets. A 4.1% increase in Snap-on's average U.S. sales per franchisee more than offset a 3.7% year-over-year decline in the average number of U.S. franchisees in the quarter. Commercial and Industrial Group operating earnings were $27.6 million on segment sales of $300.0 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with operating earnings of $17.9 million on $294.8 million of segment sales a year ago. Operating earnings as a percentage of sales increased to 9.2% in the second quarter of 2006 compared with 6.1% in 2005. The $9.7 million increase in operating earnings reflects the impact of ongoing cost reduction, low cost sourcing and continuous improvement actions, including benefits from prior restructuring actions, as well as higher sales volume and pricing. These increases in operating earnings were partially offset by inflationary cost increases of $2.2 million and higher spending related to the expansion of distribution and manufacturing in emerging markets and lower-cost regions. Sales in the second quarter of 2006 were up 1.8% year over year primarily due to sales growth in emerging markets, higher sales of hand tools for U.S. commercial and industrial applications, and increased sales of alignment product in North America. Tempering this sales growth was continued softness in certain European markets. Diagnostics and Information Group operating earnings were $13.8 million on segment sales of $128.9 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared with $13.7 million of operating earnings on $117.2 million of segment sales a year ago. Operating earnings of $13.8 million were up slightly from prior year as benefits from improved productivity and previous cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in product sales mix and higher costs to support strategic growth initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings were 10.7% in the second quarter of 2006 compared with 11.7% in 2005. Sales increases of $11.7 million year over year reflect higher OEM facilitation activity, partially offset by continued softness in Europe and lower sales of air conditioning and other equipment. Financial Services operating earnings were $3.0 million on $11.7 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2006 compared with $5.0 million of operating earnings on $16.2 million of revenue a year ago. The decrease in operating earnings primarily reflects the impact of lower net interest spreads, partially offset by higher originations. Corporate general expenses of $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2006 were essentially flat with the $12.7 million reported a year ago. Outlook Snap-on intends to continue to emphasize the implementation of its 2006 strategic priorities, including focused innovation on product, process and manufacturing cost, growth initiatives in emerging markets, and its actions to further enhance value and service to Snap-on's franchisees and customers. As previously announced, the expected costs to enhance field support and for other franchise system initiatives in the Snap-on Tools Group is anticipated to be $5 million to $7 million in 2006, of which approximately $4 million has been incurred to date. Snap-on continues to believe that the implementation of its other customer service and supply chain initiatives, along with new marketing programs, will require spending of $8 million to $10 million in 2006, as originally anticipated. Spending in the first half of 2006 for the customer service and supply chain initiatives approximated $2 million, and the remaining spend is expected to be incurred equally over the balance of the year. The Company is encouraged by the progress to date in its key initiatives, including those in the Commercial and Industrial and Diagnostics and Information segments to support emerging market, new product and other important growth initiatives. The Financial Services segment is expected to continue to be challenged by higher interest rates, and its operating results for the full year are expected to be lower than the results achieved a year ago. Based on these factors, Snap-on expects modest year-over-year earnings improvement in the second half of 2006. On May 16, 2006, Snap-on disclosed that it had reached an agreement to settle certain legal matters related to certain then current and former franchisees on a class basis. The terms of the settlement are subject to final court approval, as well as other usual and customary conditions. The settlement contains provisions that allow Snap-on to terminate the settlement agreement if more than a specified percentage of certain franchisees elect to opt out of the class. Under the terms of the settlement, Snap-on will pay an estimated $38.0 million to the claimants, including attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. This amount is subject to change depending on the actual number of claimants and the funds paid out as a result of the payment formulas included in the agreement.
