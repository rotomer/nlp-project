Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition of Assets Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits SIGNATURES
On November 28, 2006, Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on") completed its acquisition of the ProQuest Business Solutions segment ("PQBS") of ProQuest Company for $508 million in cash plus the assumption of approximately $19 million in debt. A description of the transaction was included in Snap-on's filings on Form 8-K dated October 20, 2006 and November 1, 2006, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Funding for the acquisition included the issuance of unsecured commercial paper obligations in an aggregate principal amount of $305 million. These obligations have varying maturity dates. Snap-on used proceeds of the commercial paper to fund its acquisition of PQBS. Until Snap-on is able to refinance these commercial paper borrowings with long-term debt, it intends to reissue commercial paper obligations that mature from time to time on similar terms. The commercial paper was offered and sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
In connection with the PQBS acquisition, Snap-on increased its total committed credit facilities by $250 million to $670 million, of which $352 million remained available after closing. A description of the $250 million revolving credit facility was included in Snap-on's filing on Form 8-K dated November 10, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference.
