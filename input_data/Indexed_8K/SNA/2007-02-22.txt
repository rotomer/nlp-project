Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 15, 2007, the Organization and Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Snap-on Incorporated (the "Company") approved the grant of stock options, pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated 2001 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan, as amended, to each of the Company's named executive officers and to certain other executive officers.  The stock options have an exercise price of $50.22, the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date.  Except for the option grant to Jack D. Michaels, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the stock options vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant.  In recognition of the Committee's succession planning process, the Committee provided that the options granted to Mr. Michaels vest one year from the grant date, or earlier if he retires as an executive officer before then.
The following table sets forth the number of stock options granted to each of the executive officers to be named in the 2007 annual meeting proxy statement:
 
A form of the stock option award is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference.
In a manner consistent with past practices, the Committee also determined bonuses payable in respect of 2006 performance, established 2007 compensation levels and made grants of performance-based restricted stock.
