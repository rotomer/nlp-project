EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99 Press Release of Snap-on Incorporated, dated April 24, 2007

Exhibit 99 Snap-on Announces First Quarter 2007 Results Net earnings up 76.5% over prior year on 19.6% sales increase EPS of $0.66 for the quarter compared to $0.37 last year KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2007--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional users, today announced first-quarter 2007 results. -- Net sales of $709.7 million were up $116.2 million, or 19.6%, over prior year, reflecting increases across all segments, including $49.3 million of sales from the November 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions and $17.0 million of currency translation. -- Operating earnings of $69.7 million increased $30.3 million, or 76.9%, over prior year. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings improved to 9.6% in 2007 from 6.5% in 2006. -- Net earnings of $39.0 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, increased 76.5% from net earnings of $22.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006. "Continued progress is being made as we execute our strategies to improve customer service, strengthen our brands, improve our global supply chain, and reduce overall complexity and cost," said Jack D. Michaels, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. "Our first-quarter results reflect the considerable progress that our associates are making toward these priorities, and I thank them for their continued efforts. We believe the strategies we are implementing to improve the franchise proposition and the effectiveness of our global supply chain contributed to the improvement in first-quarter results." Snap-on Tools Group segment sales of $288.5 million were up $39.8 million, or 16.0%, from prior-year levels primarily driven by a 17.1% increase in U.S. sales. Year over year, U.S. sales benefited from a 6% increase in average sales per franchisee, which included higher sales from a new mid-tier product offering and the re-launch of the company's in-house warehouse distribution program. The increase in U.S. sales also reflects the impacts of lower levels of franchisee turnover and product returns. Sales in the company's international franchise operations increased 18.5% year over year, primarily due to continued strong growth in the United Kingdom and Australia. Operating earnings of $29.3 million were up $11.1 million, or 61.0%, from operating earnings of $18.2 million in the first quarter of 2006, primarily due to the higher sales coupled with lower costs, including benefits from our Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) program. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved to 10.2% in the quarter as compared with 7.3% a year ago. Commercial & Industrial Group segment sales of $321.8 million were up 12.0% year over year largely due to increased sales of professional tools in Europe, continued strong sales growth in emerging markets, and higher sales of tools, including power and specialty tools, for industrial applications in the United States. Currency translation contributed $12.5 million of the sales increase. Operating earnings of $28.1 million increased $5.0 million, or 21.6%, from prior year, primarily due to the higher sales and benefits from ongoing cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. These increases in operating earnings were partially offset by higher restructuring costs and continued investment spending related to the expansion of distribution and manufacturing in emerging markets and lower-cost regions. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved to 8.7% in the quarter as compared with 8.0% a year ago. Diagnostics & Information Group segment sales of $167.8 million were up $48.6 million from prior-year levels primarily due to sales from the November 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions, higher Equipment Solutions sales, increased sales of handheld diagnostics and related software, and higher sales of information products from Mitchell1(TM). These increases were partially offset by the impact of outsourcing certain non-strategic, low-margin equipment products previously manufactured for the Snap-on Tools Group. Operating earnings of $21.6 million in the quarter were up $11.3 million from prior year primarily due to the earnings contribution from Business Solutions, an improved sales mix of higher-margin products, and benefits from improved productivity and cost reduction initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved to 12.9% in the quarter as compared with 8.6% a year ago. Financial Services operating earnings were $3.7 million on $13.4 million of revenue, as compared with $2.0 million of operating earnings on $11.2 million of revenue a year ago. The increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the impact of higher effective yields. "We are encouraged with the progress made to date in executing our strategic initiatives," said Michaels, "and we remain optimistic about the opportunity for sustained profitable growth and value creation." Outlook Snap-on will continue implementing its strategic and rapid continuous improvement initiatives in 2007, including its continued focus on emerging markets, product innovation, strengthening the franchise proposition, leveraging its brands, enhancing customer service, improving manufacturing and process effectiveness, lowering administrative costs, and pursuing growth initiatives. As a result of these initiatives, Snap-on anticipates continued operating and earnings improvement for the remainder of 2007. Snap-on incurred $8.2 million of exit and disposal costs in the first quarter of 2007 and, as previously communicated, the company expects to incur approximately $28 million of exit and disposal costs in 2007 as part of its ongoing efforts to lower its cost structure and improve process effectiveness. Snap-on anticipates 2007 capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 million to $60 million, and depreciation and amortization expense to approximate $70 million. As a result of higher debt levels, primarily from the Business Solutions acquisition, Snap-on anticipates incurring approximately $24 million of higher year-over-year interest expense in 2007. Snap-on expects that its full-year 2007 effective tax rate will approximate 34.5%.
