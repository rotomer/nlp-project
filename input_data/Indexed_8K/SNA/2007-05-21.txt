Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 18, 2007, Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on") entered into an agreement (the "Agreement") pursuant to which Snap-on will sell its Sun Electric Systems ("SES") business based in the Netherlands to DUINMAAIJER B.V., a limited liability company represented by an employee of SES, for a nominal cash purchase price.   The transaction, which is subject to final documentation and customary closing conditions, is expected to close by the end of July 2007 and is not subject to any financing conditions.
SES's primary business is the research, development and manufacture of test equipment in Europe for aircraft hydraulics.  SES reported sales of $18.3 million in 2006 and is not a significant subsidiary of Snap-on.  Snap-on is divesting of SES as it has deemed SES to be non-core to Snap-on's ongoing business strategies.  Snap-on believes that the anticipated future capital and other resources necessary to be expended in connection with the SES business are not consistent with Snap-on's growth plans.
As a result of entering into the Agreement, Snap-on has met the "held-for-sale" requirements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "" Snap-on expects to record an estimated $7 million after tax loss ($0.12 per diluted share) in the second quarter ended June 30, 2007, related to the sale of SES.  Snap-on will present SES's results of operations, including the estimated $7 million loss, as "discontinued operations" in its second quarter 2007 consolidated statements of earnings.  At closing, Snap-on expects to incur cash expenditures related to the sale of SES, including transaction and other costs, of approximately $6 million.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, Snap-on Incorporated has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
