EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99 Press Release of Snap-on Incorporated, dated July 24, 2007

Exhibit 99 Snap-on Announces Second Quarter 2007 Results Second quarter 2007 EPS from continuing operations of $0.90; EPS of $0.20 in 2006 includes $0.40 per share charge for franchisee settlement KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 24, 2007--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional users, today announced second-quarter 2007 results. -- Net sales of $711.9 million were up $90.2 million, or 14.5%, over prior year, reflecting increases across all segments, including $49.6 million of sales from the November 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions and $16.5 million of currency translation. -- Operating earnings of $87.4 million increased $67.4 million over prior year on higher sales, improved margins and lower costs. Operating earnings as a percent of revenues improved to 12.0% in 2007 from 9.2% (excluding the franchisee settlement charge) in 2006. Operating earnings in 2006 included a $38.0 million charge related to the settlement of franchisee litigation matters. -- Net earnings from continuing operations in 2007 of $52.8 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compares to $35.1 million, or $0.60 per share, excluding the franchisee settlement charge in 2006. Net earnings in 2007 of $43.8 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, include a $9.0 million, or $0.16 per share, net loss from the sale of a non-core business in Europe. Net earnings in 2006 of $11.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, included a $23.4 million, or $0.40 per share, after-tax charge for the franchisee settlement. -- Continued year-over-year operating and earnings improvement is expected for the remainder of 2007. "We are pleased with the progress that is being made in executing our strategies," said Jack D. Michaels, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. "Our second-quarter results reflect the continued progress our associates are making toward improving customer service, strengthening our brands, improving our global supply chain, and reducing overall complexity and cost. Our Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) tools are proving to be a great enabler and our associates are increasingly embracing them. I thank them for all of their efforts. The divestiture of the non-core business is consistent with our plans to focus resources on our strategies for building sustainable profitable growth and long-term shareholder value." Snap-on Tools Group segment sales of $284.0 million were up $13.2 million, or 4.9%, from prior year largely due to a 4.6% increase in U.S. sales, including higher sales from a new mid-tier product offering and the re-launch of the company's in-house warehouse distribution program. Sales in the company's international franchise operations increased $4.1 million, or 7.9%, year over year, primarily due to continued strong sales growth in Australia and $2.6 million of currency translation. Operating earnings of $34.7 million were up $8.2 million, or 30.9%, from $26.5 million (excluding the franchisee settlement charge) in the second quarter of 2006. (See attached reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release.) The operating earnings increase is primarily due to higher sales and lower costs, including benefits from the execution of our strategies. As a percentage of sales, and after excluding the settlement charge in 2006, operating earnings improved to 12.2% as compared with 9.8% a year ago. Commercial & Industrial Group segment sales of $331.6 million were up 10.5% year over year largely due to increased sales of professional tools in Europe, higher sales of tools for industrial applications, continued strong sales growth in emerging markets, and higher sales of equipment in Europe. Currency translation contributed $11.2 million of the sales increase. Operating earnings of $32.5 million increased $4.9 million, or 17.8%, from prior year, largely due to the higher sales and benefits from ongoing cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, partially offset by increased restructuring charges and continued investment spending related to the expansion of distribution and manufacturing in emerging markets and lower-cost regions. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the quarter improved to 9.8% as compared with 9.2% a year ago. Diagnostics & Information Group segment sales of $165.3 million were up $39.1 million from prior year primarily due to higher sales of Mitchell1(TM) information products, increased sales of handheld diagnostics and related software, and incremental sales from Business Solutions. These increases were partially offset by $16.3 million of lower sales from the wind down of an OEM facilitation program and the outsourcing of certain non-strategic, low-margin equipment products previously manufactured and sold to the Snap-on Tools Group. Operating earnings of $29.3 million in the quarter were up $15.6 million from prior year largely due to the higher sales, an improved sales mix of higher-margin products, and benefits from productivity and cost reduction initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved to 17.7% in the quarter as compared with 10.9% a year ago. Financial Services operating earnings were $5.1 million on $14.8 million of revenue, as compared with $3.0 million of operating earnings on $11.7 million of revenue a year ago. The increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the impact of higher effective yields. "We're encouraged by the progress being made in executing our strategic initiatives across all of our businesses," said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on president and chief operating officer. "Our RCI efforts are enabling us to embed sustainable processes that drive growth initiatives across the corporation while making great strides in eliminating waste and reducing costs. While we have much work ahead, we are optimistic regarding the opportunity for continued profitable growth and value creation." Outlook Snap-on expects to continue implementing its strategic and RCI initiatives in the balance of 2007, including its focus on global growth initiatives, product innovation, strengthening the franchise proposition, leveraging its brands, enhancing customer service, improving manufacturing and process effectiveness, and lowering administrative costs. As a result, Snap-on anticipates continued year-over-year operating and earnings improvement for the remainder of 2007. Snap-on incurred $14.7 million of exit and disposal costs in the first six months of 2007 and, as previously communicated, the company expects to incur approximately $28 million of such costs in 2007 as part of its ongoing efforts to lower its cost structure and improve process effectiveness. Snap-on anticipates 2007 capital expenditures to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million, and depreciation and amortization expense to approximate $70 million. As a result of higher debt levels, primarily from the Business Solutions acquisition, Snap-on anticipates incurring approximately $24 million of higher year-over-year interest expense in 2007. Snap-on expects that its effective tax rate for the second-half of 2007 will approximate 34.5%.
