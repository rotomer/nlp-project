Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On August 10, 2007, Snap-on entered into a five-year $500 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on August 10, 2012. This $500 million facility replaces Snap-on's previous $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility set to terminate on July 27, 2009. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc were the joint lead arrangers and book runners for the $500 million multi-currency revolving credit facility. The $500 million revolving credit facility's financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders' equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00 or a ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended, of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of the date of this document, Snap-on believes it is in compliance with all covenants of this revolving credit facility.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 10, 2007, in connection with the transaction described in Item 1.01 above, Snap-on terminated its $400 million revolving credit facility set to terminate on July 27, 2009. Citigroup Global Markets was the sole lead arranger and book manager for the $400 million revolving credit facility. The $400 million credit facility required that Snap-on maintain a ratio of total debt plus shareholders' equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00. At the time of termination, Snap-on believes that it was in compliance with all of the covenants under the $400 million credit facility. For the circumstances relating to the termination of the $400 million credit facility, see Item 1.01 above which is incorporated by reference.

If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; , , that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the Effective Date, when a change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it will deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note, unless any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred after the date such Lender becomes a party hereunder which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Agent. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-BEN or W-ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

On May 16, 2006, Snap-on reached an agreement to settle certain legal matters related to certain then current and former franchisees on a class basis. The court gave its final approval to the class settlement on October 27, 2006. Under the terms of the settlement, Snap-on agreed to make payments to claimants and class counsel, plus incur certain other costs and expenses. Snap-on recorded a $38.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 representing its best estimate to settle these legal matters. As of June 30, 2007, the majority of the settlement funds, including payments to the class participants made in the first quarter of 2007, have been disbursed. Snap-on has not admitted any wrongdoing by way of this settlement.
