Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment
of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Susan F. Marrinan, the Vice President, Secretary and Chief Legal Officer of Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on" or the "Company") and one of Snap-on's named executive officers, intends to retire from the Company on May 31, 2008.  On August 31, 2007, Snap-on entered into a letter agreement (the "Agreement") with Ms. Marrinan regarding her retirement from the Company.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Ms. Marrinan will remain in her current position through November 30, 2007, or such other date as specified (the "Active Employment Period").  After such time, Ms. Marrinan is expected to provide transitional legal advisory services, as requested by the Company, through May 31, 2008 (the "Inactive Employment Period").  The transitional legal advisory services are expected to involve those areas and matters in which Ms. Marrinan is involved prior to the commencement of the Inactive Employment Period and assistance in transitioning management of the Company's legal department.
The Company is in the process of beginning its search for Ms. Marrinan's successor.
During the Inactive Employment Period, provided that Ms. Marrinan executes a waiver and release, all of the benefits relating to Ms. Marrinan's employment with the Company will remain unchanged; however, she will not participate in any of the Company's 2008 incentive compensation programs or stock option grants.
Provided that Ms. Marrinan executes a waiver and release following her retirement date, Ms. Marrinan will receive the following additional benefits: an amount equal to the number of weeks of her current annualized base salary determined by subtracting from 52 weeks the number of weeks of her current annualized base salary paid during the Inactive Employment Period; continuation of health and dental insurance for a period of up to 18 months; and the payment of any premiums (until age 65) under the Company's retiree health coverage.
The Agreement supersedes, among other things, the letter agreement between the Company and Ms. Marrinan, dated September 18, 1990.
The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

You further acknowledge and agree that the Company's offer of the inactive employment period arrangement to you and your signing of this letter agreement and the Waiver and Release Agreement attached hereto as Attachment I does not in any way indicate that you have any viable claims against the Company nor that the Company admits or has any liability to you whatsoever.

Retirement From Employment/Retirement Benefits
Provided that (i) you remain in the employ of the Company through the active employment period and inactive employment period, and (ii) abide by your

The Company reserves the right to separate you from employment prior to May 31, 2008 in the event that the Company determines in its reasonable judgment that you are in breach of this letter agreement and/or the Waiver and Release Agreement attached hereto as Attachment I.
All salary and any employee benefits due to you as of your May 31, 2008 retirement date or earlier separation date according to the established policies, plans and procedures of the Company shall be paid or made available to you in accordance with the terms of those established policies, plans and procedures.

(d)
