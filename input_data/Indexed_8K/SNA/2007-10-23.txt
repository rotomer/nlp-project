EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99 Press Release of Snap-on Incorporated, dated October 23, 2007

Exhibit 99 Snap-on Announces Third Quarter 2007 Results Third quarter EPS of $0.70 compares to $0.48 in 2006; EPS increases 45.8% on 14.5% sales increase; Recipient of three 2007 "MOTOR Magazine - Top 20 Tools" awards for product innovation KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2007--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional users, today announced third-quarter 2007 results. -- Net sales of $680.7 million increased $86.0 million, or 14.5%, over prior year reflecting increases across all segments, including $48.6 million of sales from the November 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions and $19.3 million of currency translation. Partially offsetting the sales increase was $22.5 million of lower sales from the wind down of an OEM facilitation program. -- Operating earnings of $72.4 million increased $26.8 million, or 58.8%, over prior year on higher sales and continued margin improvements. As a percent of revenues, operating earnings improved to 10.4% in 2007 from 7.5% in 2006. -- Net earnings in 2007 of $41.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, improved from $28.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in 2006. Continued year-over-year operating and earnings improvement is expected for the remainder of 2007. "Our third-quarter results continue to reflect the progress being made by our associates in executing our strategies," said Jack D. Michaels, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. "Improvements in delivery, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) - our core beliefs - are being obtained across our businesses, allowing us to increasingly capture profitable growth opportunities. In addition, Snap-on's continued recognition for product innovation reflects our commitment to providing customers with the most valued productivity solutions to help them better service today's technologically advanced vehicles." Snap-on Tools Group segment sales of $262.0 million increased $18.1 million, or 7.4%, from prior-year levels, including a 5.4% increase in North America. Sales in the company's international franchise operations increased $7.6 million, or 15.4%, year over year, primarily due to continued strong sales growth in the U.K. and Australia. Currency translation contributed $4.4 million of the segment's year-over-year sales increase. Operating earnings of $24.6 million were up $8.9 million, or 56.7%, from $15.7 million in the third quarter of 2006 primarily due to higher sales and lower costs, including continued benefits from RCI. The $8.9 million increase in operating earnings also includes $5.3 million of higher year-over-year LIFO related inventory expenses (charges of $2.6 million in 2007 and benefits of $2.7 million in 2006) and $1.9 million of higher production and material costs. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved to 9.4% as compared with 6.4% a year ago. Commercial & Industrial Group segment sales of $327.9 million were up 14.3% year over year largely due to higher industrial sales, increased sales of professional tools and equipment in Europe, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Excluding $12.1 million of currency translation, year-over-year organic sales growth was 10.1%. Operating earnings of $32.7 million increased $9.4 million, or 40.3%, from prior year, largely due to the higher sales and benefits from ongoing cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, partially offset by continued investment spending to expand distribution and manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets and lower-cost regions. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved to 10.0% as compared with 8.1% a year ago. Diagnostics & Information Group segment sales of $152.0 million were up $25.1 million, or 19.8%, from the prior year, including $3.5 million from currency translation. Incremental sales from Business Solutions and higher year-over-year sales of diagnostics and information products were partially offset by lower OEM facilitation sales, including $22.5 million of lower sales from the wind down of a 2006 facilitation program in Europe. Operating earnings of $22.2 million increased $6.3 million from prior-year levels largely due to the higher sales and a more favorable product mix, as well as continued benefits from RCI initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved to 14.6% as compared with 12.5% a year ago. Financial Services operating earnings were $5.6 million on $15.8 million of revenue, as compared with $3.0 million of operating earnings on $11.3 million of revenue a year ago. The increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the impact of higher customer yields and lower borrowing costs. Outlook Snap-on expects to continue implementing its strategic and RCI initiatives, including its focus on global growth, product innovation, strengthening the franchise proposition, enhancing customer service, leveraging its brands, and improving manufacturing flexibility and process effectiveness. As a result, Snap-on anticipates continued year-over-year operating and earnings improvement in the fourth quarter of 2007. Snap-on incurred $16.5 million of exit and disposal costs in the first nine months of 2007 and may incur up to $25 million of such costs (down from the previously communicated $28 million) for full-year 2007 as part of its ongoing efforts to lower its cost structure and improve process effectiveness. Snap-on anticipates 2007 capital expenditures to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million, and depreciation and amortization expense to approximate $70 million. As a result of higher debt levels, primarily from the Business Solutions acquisition, Snap-on anticipates incurring approximately $25 million of higher year-over-year interest expense in 2007. Snap-on expects that its effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 will approximate 34.5%. "Clearly, our third-quarter results show encouraging and continued progress," said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on president and chief operating officer, "and I thank our associates worldwide for their individual and collective contributions in achieving these results. We believe that the focused implementation of our strategies is resulting in a solid operating platform that will support higher levels of future growth and earnings. With broad and expanding markets, well-recognized brands, an enviable competitive position, a network of dedicated franchisees and a solid management team, we remain encouraged regarding our prospects going forward and our ability to drive increasing levels of long-term shareholder return."
