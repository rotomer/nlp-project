EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Second Quarter 2008 Results
Reports year-over-year sales increase of 7.6%; EPS from continuing operations of $1.15 increases 27.8% from $0.90 last year; Expects continued year-over-year improvements for the balance of 2008
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics, equipment, software and service solutions for professional users, today announced operating results for the second quarter of 2008.
Snap-ons second quarter operating performance evidences continued achievements in our strategic diversification and growth initiatives, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-ons president and chief executive officer. Despite the continued macroeconomic challenges, the strength of our global and diverse customer base and the value created by our innovation and rapid continuous improvement processes combined to deliver significant sales and profit improvements. My thanks to our associates and franchisees for their ongoing support and for their crucial roles in achieving another encouraging quarter.
Highlights of Snap-ons second quarter 2008 operating results are as follows:
Net sales of $766.1 million increased $54.2 million, or 7.6%, over prior year, including $32.4 million from currency translation; sales increased 3.1% excluding currency translation.
Operating earnings of $111.7 million increased 27.8%, or $24.3 million, over prior year, including $4.5 million of lower restructuring costs and $2.3 million of currency translation. Operating earnings as a percent of revenues improved to 14.2% in 2008 from 12.0% in 2007.
Net earnings from continuing operations of $66.9 million increased 26.7% from $52.8 million in 2007; diluted earnings of $1.15 per share increased 27.8% from $0.90 per diluted share in 2007.
segment sales of $387.7 million were up $56.1 million, or 16.9%, from prior year, including $25.0 million of currency translation. Excluding currency translation, sales growth was 9.4%, with strong contributions from Snap-ons global industrial and power tools businesses. Continued growth in emerging markets, increased sales of imaging alignment systems, and higher sales of professional tools in Europe also contributed to the year-over-year sales increase.
Commercial & Industrial Group
Operating earnings of $49.3 million increased $16.8 million, or 51.7%, from prior year primarily due to the sales improvement, including higher sales of innovative new product, improved pricing and continued benefits from Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) and other cost reduction initiatives, which more than offset higher production and material costs. The operating earnings increase also reflects $5.0 million of lower restructuring costs and $1.5 million of currency translation. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the quarter improved to 12.7% as compared with 9.8% a year ago.
segment sales of $292.8 million increased $8.8 million, or 3.1%, from prior-year levels, including $5.5 million of currency translation. Higher sales in the companys international franchise operations were largely offset by lower North American franchise sales. In the United States, sales declined 4.1% from 2007 levels primarily due to a more challenging economic environment for sales of higher-priced tool storage and diagnostics products.
Snap-on Tools Group
Operating earnings of $35.3 million were up $0.6 million from prior-year levels. Price increases and benefits from RCI initiatives offset steel, freight and certain other product cost increases. Lower costs from improving franchise termination trends were offset by a lower margin contribution due to the shift in product mix in the United States. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the quarter were 12.1% as compared with 12.2% a year ago.
segment sales of $164.8 million were down slightly from prior-year levels as higher diagnostics sales in Europe, increased sales of Mitchell1 information products and $2.9 million of currency translation were more than offset by $13.2 million of lower OEM program sales. The lower OEM program sales primarily resulted from the 2007 rollout of a major essential tool program in North America and the continued impact of the wind down of a facilitation program in Europe.
Diagnostics & Information Group
Operating earnings of $31.0 million were up $1.7 million from prior-year levels as benefits from RCI initiatives and an improved sales mix of higher-margin diagnostics and information products largely offset the sales decline in the OEM business. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the quarter improved to 18.8% as compared with 17.7% a year ago.
operating income was $10.8 million on $18.3 million of revenue, as compared with $5.1 million of operating income on $14.8 million of revenue a year ago, primarily due to higher net yields as a result of lower market discount rates.
Financial Services
Outlook
Snap-on expects to continue investing in its strategic growth initiatives aimed at expanding value provided to its traditional customers, penetrating new and adjacent segments, and extending its presence in the emerging markets of Asia/Pacific and Eastern Europe.
Snap-on expects that its sales and earnings for the balance of 2008 will continue to exceed 2007 levels. Snap-on incurred $6.6 million of restructuring costs in the first six months of 2008 and expects full year 2008 restructuring costs to be in a range of $13 million to $16 million, down from its previous estimate of $15 million to $20 million. Snap-on anticipates that its full year effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests will approximate 33.3% in 2008.
