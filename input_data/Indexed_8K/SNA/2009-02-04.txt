EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings
Fourth quarter EPS of $1.01 compares to $0.98 last year;
Full year 2008 EPS increases 31.7% to $4.07;
Recognized by Entrepreneur Magazine as a 2009 top ten home-based franchise and top 2009 mobile tool franchise
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 4, 2009--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics, equipment, software and service solutions for professional users, today announced 2008 financial results for the fourth quarter and full year.
Net sales of $667.8 million in the quarter declined 10.1%, from prior year, with 5.7% due to unfavorable currency translation.
Operating earnings of $97.5 million in the quarter increased $1.2 million over prior year. The year-over-year comparison benefited from $9.3 million of lower incentive compensation expense and $5.4 million from the adjustment of a pre-acquisition contingency associated with the acquisition of Business Solutions. The year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by $6.4 million of unfavorable currency translation, $6.3 million of LIFO-related inventory valuation expense and, in 2007, a $4.0 million gain from the sale of a facility. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings in the quarter improved to 14.2% as compared with 12.6% in 2007.
Snap-on reports record fourth quarter net earnings of $58.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, as compared with $57.3 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2007. The fourth-quarter effective income tax rate was 31.9% in 2008 compared with 31.2% in 2007.
For the 2008 fiscal year, net sales of $2.85 billion compare to $2.84 billion in 2007. Operating earnings in 2008 improved to 13.2% of revenues, as compared to 11.2% in 2007. Earnings per diluted share improved 31.7% to a record $4.07 in 2008, as compared to $3.09 in 2007. Pretax return on invested capital was 22.3% in 2008, as compared to 20.0% for the comparable 2007 fiscal year. Pretax return on invested capital is defined as earnings before interest and taxes divided by the average of shareholders equity and net debt.
As a result of worsening economic conditions and continued tight credit markets, customer demand weakened in the fourth quarter, particularly affecting our sales of big-ticket products, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on president and chief executive officer. Given these unprecedented economic headwinds, we are pleased with our relative performance, having earned record profits in both the fourth quarter and full year. I thank our franchisees and associates for their contributions in achieving these record results.
segment sales of $326.8 million in the quarter declined $42.5 million, or 11.5%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $24.4 million of unfavorable currency translation, sales declined 4.9% year over year primarily due to continued lower sales of professional tools in Europe and lower overall equipment sales worldwide, despite strong double-digit increases in sales of our innovative imaging aligner units. These year-over-year sales declines were partially offset by continued higher sales to industrial customers.
Commercial & Industrial Group
Operating earnings of $39.1 million in the quarter increased $0.9 million from prior year as contributions from higher pricing, ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) and other cost reduction initiatives, and $7.3 million of lower year-over-year restructuring costs were largely offset by the impacts of lower sales, inflationary and other cost increases, and $3.1 million of unfavorable currency translation. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 benefited from a one-time, $4.0 million gain from the sale of a facility in Europe. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the quarter improved to 12.0% as compared with 10.3% a year ago.
segment sales of $252.4 million in the quarter declined $20.8 million, or 7.6%, from 2007 levels. Excluding $12.2 million of unfavorable currency translation, year-over-year sales declined 3.1% reflecting a more challenging sales environment, particularly for sales of higher-priced products and hand tools. Sales in the companys U.S. franchise operations declined 5.0% year over year, while organic sales in the companys international franchise operations were up slightly.
Snap-on Tools Group
Operating earnings of $19.8 million, or 7.8% of sales, in the quarter, compares to $36.5 million, or 13.4% of sales, last year. Operating earnings in 2008 includes $4.2 million of restructuring costs and $0.3 million of LIFO-related inventory expense, while last years operating earnings included $0.5 million of restructuring costs and $6.0 million of LIFO-related inventory income. Excluding restructuring costs and LIFO-related inventory effects in both years, operating earnings as a percent of net sales were 9.6% in 2008, as compared to 11.3% in 2007. This 170 basis point (100 basis point equals one percent) decline in year-over-year operating margin is due principally to a less favorable product sales mix, higher production and material costs, increased promotional spending and lower factory absorption due to production slowdowns.
We firmly believe in the strength of the Snap-on franchise model and are pleased to once again be recognized by as a top ten home-based franchise and as the top 2009 mobile tool franchise, said Pinchuk.
Entrepreneur Magazine
segment sales of $152.9 million in the quarter declined $16.6 million, or 9.8%, from 2007 levels primarily due to lower OEM program sales in Europe and $7.1 million of unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products in North America. Excluding currency translation, organic sales declined 5.6% year over year.
Diagnostics & Information Group
Operating earnings of $34.3 million, or 22.4% of sales, in the quarter compares to $27.4 million, or 16.2% of sales, last year. The $6.9 million increase in year-over-year operating earnings includes a $5.4 million adjustment of a pre-acquisition contingency; the balance of the operating margin improvement resulted from a more favorable product mix and contributions from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives.
operating income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $8.9 million on $19.7 million of revenue as compared with $8.0 million of operating income on $19.0 million of revenue a year ago. Origination volume in the quarter declined 12.8% from 2007 levels, but lower market discount rates enabled the year-over-year operating income improvement.
Financial Services
expenses of $4.6 million in the quarter declined $9.2 million from prior-year levels primarily due to $5.0 million of lower year-over-year performance-based incentive compensation expense and $4.3 million of lower year-over-year stock-based incentive compensation expense.
Corporate
Outlook
The challenges posed by the global economy increased significantly during the fourth quarter, furthering the impact on Snap-ons sales of higher priced products, such as tool storage and vehicle repair equipment. Additional slowdowns in the economies of Europe, particularly Southern Europe, negatively impacted volume at the companys European-based tools business. Furthermore, the general economic difficulties are now spreading across more industries and to additional geographies, creating more widespread pressure on business activity. In the near term, Snap-on anticipates no change in this environment and, as a result, expects sales and credit originations in the first quarter of 2009 to be down year over year.
Additional headwinds in 2009 now include approximately $3.0 million per quarter of higher year-over-year pension expense due to declines in pension asset values. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain at recent levels, the company also anticipates approximately $8.0 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact on first quarter operating earnings.
Snap-on believes that its business models are sound and that it continues to maintain and expand its strong brand positions. When coupled with its innovation processes, Snap-on believes that these strengths have enabled the advancement of its market position in 2008. The company expects to benefit from those strengths in 2009 and to improve its strategic position going forward. Snap-on also expects further benefits in 2009 from its RCI, sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives that will help to limit the impact of any volume decline.
Snap-on does not, as a general practice, furnish quarterly sales or earnings projections. However, in light of these factors and conditions, the company believes that first quarter 2009 sales and earnings will be lower than reported first quarter 2008 amounts.
Snap-on is responding to the global macroeconomic challenges by deepening and accelerating its RCI and cost reduction initiatives. Snap-on recorded $6.7 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2008, bringing full-year 2008 restructuring costs to $14.7 million; Snap-on expects to incur approximately $12 million to $16 million of restructuring costs in full year 2009. Snap-on is also continuing and accelerating a number of its planned growth investments, including further expansion of its manufacturing capacity in China and in Eastern Europe. As a result, capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to be in a range of $75 million to $80 million. Snap-on views these investments as potentially enabling near-term growth. For full year 2009, Snap-on anticipates that its effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests will approximate 34%.
In 2009, Snap-on will continue to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented; the current economic uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to presently predict this balance as the company continually adjusts to the challenging business environment.
