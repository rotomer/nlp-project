Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces First Quarter 2009 Results
EPS of $0.60 for the first quarter 2009;
Global recession and general uncertainty cause expected lower sales and earnings;
Continues planned expansion efforts in emerging-growth markets
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 22, 2009--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics, equipment, software and service solutions for professional users, today announced operating results for the first quarter of 2009.
Net sales of $572.6 million in the quarter declined 20.6% from 2008 levels; down 13.1% excluding foreign currency translation.
Operating earnings of $64.3 million in the quarter decreased $28.9 million from 2008 levels. Foreign currency impacts reduced 2009 operating earnings by $11.0 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings were 10.9% as compared with 12.5% last year.
Net earnings attributable to Snap-on of $34.8 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with $56.6 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, in 2008.
Continuing difficult economic conditions further weakened customer demand in the first quarter, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on president and chief executive officer. In light of these challenges we increased our focus on rapid continuous improvement, sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives. At the same time, we moved forward during the quarter with our strategic growth investments and with our most important value creation initiatives, such as product innovation. I thank our franchisees and associates worldwide for their continuing confidence and contributions during these challenging times.
segment sales of $259.8 million in the quarter declined $96.9 million, or 27.2%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $33.6 million of unfavorable currency translation, year-over-year sales declined 17.7% principally due to continued lower sales of professional tools in Europe and decreased sales of equipment worldwide.
Commercial & Industrial Group
Operating earnings of $18.0 million in the quarter declined $20.2 million from prior-year levels primarily due to the lower sales volumes, including the costs to carry manufacturing capacity, and $3.9 million of unfavorable currency translation. These declines in year-over-year operating earnings were partially offset by $6.6 million of savings from ongoing efficiency, productivity and other cost reduction (collectively Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives.
segment sales of $242.4 million in the quarter declined $46.9 million, or 16.2%, from 2008 levels; excluding $15.9 million of unfavorable currency translation, organic sales declined 10.7%. The year-over-year sales decline is primarily due to the continued challenging sales environment, particularly for sales of larger-price items.
Snap-on Tools Group
Operating earnings of $21.1 million in the quarter declined $13.3 million from 2008 levels primarily due to the lower sales volumes, including the costs to carry manufacturing capacity, and unfavorable currency movement. The stronger U.S. dollar decreased international margins on U.S. sourced product by $5.3 million and currency translation further reduced operating earnings by $2.4 million. These declines in year-over-year operating earnings were partially offset by $6.5 million of savings from RCI initiatives.
segment sales of $132.5 million in the quarter declined $22.5 million, or 14.5%, from 2008 levels. Excluding $6.7 million of unfavorable currency translation, year-over-year sales declined 10.2% as higher volumes of diagnostics products in Europe and increased sales of Mitchell1 information products were more than offset by lower essential tool and facilitation program sales to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) dealerships and by lower volumes of diagnostics products in North America.
Diagnostics & Information Group
Operating earnings of $25.7 million in the quarter increased $5.3 million, or 26.0%, over 2008 levels primarily due to $5.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives and $1.8 million of lower restructuring costs. These improvements to year-over-year operating earnings were partially offset by the lower sales and by $1.9 million of increased software development costs.
operating income of $10.0 million in the quarter declined $2.8 million from 2008 levels primarily due to lower levels of originations partially offset by contributions from lower market discount rates.
Financial Services
expenses of $10.5 million in the quarter declined $2.1 million from prior-year levels primarily due to lower performance-based and stock-based incentive compensation expense partially offset by $3.0 million of expected higher pension expense.
Corporate
Outlook
As expected, the difficulties posed by the global economy increased significantly during the first quarter, further challenging Snap-ons sales of big-ticket items, such as tool storage and undercar equipment, and these difficult economic conditions further extended across more industries and geographies. Slowdowns in the economies of Europe deepened, particularly in Southern Europe, further impacting volume at the companys European-based tools business. In the near term, Snap-on anticipates no change in this environment and, as a result, expects sales and earnings in the second quarter of 2009 to be down year over year.
Snap-on is continuously responding to the global macroeconomic challenges by furthering its RCI and cost reduction initiatives. Snap-on recorded $2.0 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2009 and now anticipates that full-year 2009 restructuring costs will be in a range of $14 million to $18 million, up from the previously communicated $12 million to $16 million. Snap-on expects restructuring costs in the second quarter of 2009 to approximate $8 million to $10 million. Snap-on is also continuing a number of its planned growth investments, including further expansion of its manufacturing capacity in China and in Eastern Europe. Capital expenditures for full-year 2009 are expected to be in a range of $60 million to $70 million, down from the previously communicated $75 million to $80 million.
The company continues to expect approximately $3.0 million per quarter of higher year-over-year pension expense in 2009 due to declines in pension asset values. In the first quarter, foreign currency effects reduced operating earnings by $11.0 million on a year-over-year basis which, at current exchange rates, could similarly impact second quarter year-over-year comparisons. Snap-on anticipates that its full-year 2009 effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings will approximate 33.4%.
In 2009, Snap-on will continue to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing strategic growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented; the current economic uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to presently predict this balance as the company continually adjusts to the challenging business environment.
