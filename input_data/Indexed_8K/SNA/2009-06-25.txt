Other Events.
 
The Snap-on Credit LLC joint venture between Snap-on Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated, and CIT Credit Group USA Inc., a subsidiary of The CIT Group Inc., renews automatically on an annual basis commencing in 2010, unless either party gives notice of termination six months prior to the expiration of the current term due to expire on January 2, 2010.  Because discussions between the parties concerning extending the joint venture are ongoing, the parties agreed on June 25, 2009 to extend the date by which notice of termination may be given from July 3, 2009 until September 15, 2009.  As a result of this agreement, notice by either party that it intends to terminate the joint venture agreement can be given on or before September 15, 2009.  The joint venture arrangements are not otherwise affected.
