Other Events
 
Effective January 4, 2009, Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on" or "the company") adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 160, as described more fully in Note 1 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included in Snap-on's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as of and for the fiscal three month period ended April 4, 2009, and the fiscal three and six month periods ended July 4, 2009.  The adoption of SFAS No. 160 did not have a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
"Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,"
 
As a result of the retrospective presentation and disclosure requirements of SFAS No.160, Snap-on will  reflect the changes in presentation and disclosure in its consolidated financial statements for all periods presented in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission subsequent to the effective date. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 impacted the presentation and disclosure of noncontrolling (minority) interests in the company's consolidated financial statements.  SFAS No. 160 requires that noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries be classified in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of consolidated shareholders' equity.  Previously, Snap-on included noncontrolling (minority) interests in other long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets.
 
The principal effect on the prior year balance sheets related to the adoption of SFAS No. 160 is summarized as follows:

Rule

Rule

requires
shares
whose
redemptions
are
outside

the
control

On
March

2008,
Snap-on
acquired
a
60%
interest
in
Zhejiang
Wanda
Tools
Co.,
Ltd.
("Wanda
Snap-on"),
a
tool
manufacturer
in
China.
 
The
Wanda
Snap-on
joint
venture
agreement
granted
a
redeemable
noncontrolling
interest
right
to
the
noncontrolling
shareholder
that
could
require
Snap-on
to
acquire

certain
metrics
(as

in
the
joint
venture
agreement)
are
reached
during

period

date.
 
Snap-on
does
not

that
the
redeemable

will

exercisable.
 
The
related
redeemable
noncontrolling
interest
of
$4.3
million
as
of
January
3,
2009
($4.9
million
redeemable
noncontrolling
interest
less
fiscal
2008
loss
of
$0.6
million),
is
included
in
other
long-term
liabilities
on
the
respective
consolidated
balance
sheet;
there
was
no
redeemable
noncontrolling
interest
as
of
December
29,
2007.
 
Net
earnings
attributable
to
the
redeemable
noncontrolling
interest
are
included
in
both
net
earnings
and
net
earnings
attributable
to
noncontrolling
interests
on
the
consolidated
statements
of
earnings.
 
SFAS No. 160 also changes net earnings on the face of the consolidated statements of earnings.  Prior to SFAS No. 160, net earnings excluded net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.  SFAS No. 160 requires that net earnings include net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. SFAS No. 160 also requires that a separate caption for net earnings attributable to Snap-on Incorporated be presented in the consolidated statements of earnings that equals net earnings as previously reported prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 160.   After adoption of SFAS No. 160, net earnings increased by $6.9 million, $4.9 million and $3.7 million for the fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 years, respectively, due to the inclusion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests; net earnings attributable to Snap-on Incorporated is equal to net earnings as previously reported prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 160.
The retrospective changes made to the financial statements for periods prior to the company's adoption of SFAS No. 160 are set forth in the following updated financial statements, the originals of which were a part of Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2009:
 
 
The financial statements are included in Exhibit 99 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
