Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Results
Sales of $618.1 million and EPS of $0.63 for the fourth quarter;
Operating earnings increase 38.4% from third-quarter 2009 levels;
Operating cash flow continues to outpace earnings;
Financial services transition continues on track
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 4, 2010--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics, equipment, software and service solutions for professional users, today announced 2009 financial results for the fourth quarter and full year.
Sales of $618.1 million in the quarter were up $36.3 million, or 6.2%, sequentially from third-quarter 2009 levels. Fourth-quarter 2009 sales declined 7.4% from 2008 levels; excluding foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 11.1%.
Gross profit of $284.4 million in the quarter represented 46.0% of sales compared with 44.8% in the 2009 third quarter and 44.9% a year ago.
Operating earnings before financial services in the 2009 fourth quarter were 11.5% of sales compared with 9.3% in the 2009 third quarter and 13.2% in the strong fourth quarter of a year ago. The fourth quarter operating loss from financial services of $3.8 million was due to the July 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture with CIT Group Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2008, financial services contributed $8.9 million of operating income.
Operating cash flow of $96.7 million in the quarter increased from $47.8 million last year. For the full year, operating cash flow of $347.1 million in 2009 increased $126.7 million over 2008 levels.
Net earnings of $36.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased $11.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, from 2009 third quarter levels. Fourth quarter net earnings declined $22.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, from record 2008 earnings levels, with financial services contributing $9.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, of the decline.
Full year sales of $2.36 billion declined 17.2% from 2008 levels; excluding 3.0 percentage points of foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 14.2%. Full year net earnings of $134.2 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $236.7 million, or $4.07 per diluted share, in 2008, with financial services contributing $17.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, of the decline.
We are encouraged by Snap-ons fourth quarter results and by the financial and strategic headway reflected in our performance, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. While our overall results were below the record earnings achieved in the strong fourth quarter of 2008, our operations continued their sequential increases in the period. In addition, our financial services transition remains on track as we build our on-book finance portfolio.
We are further pleased to have achieved a double-digit operating margin for the quarter in this weak economy, providing continuing testimony to the substantial benefits of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. We also strengthened our positions in our franchise network, in critical industries, in auto repair garage infrastructure, and in emerging markets - arenas that will be critical as the environment improves. Given the significant economic headwinds of 2009, we have registered encouraging progress for both the fourth quarter and the full year. I thank our franchisees and our associates throughout the world for their contributions and commitment that made it all possible.
operating earnings in the fourth quarter increased sequentially by $12.2 million over third-quarter 2009 levels on $36.8 million of higher sales.
Commercial & Industrial Group
Segment sales of $302.2 million in the fourth quarter declined $24.6 million, or 7.5%, from 2008 levels; excluding foreign currency translation organic sales declined $41.9 million, or 12.2%. Continued lower sales in Europe were partially offset by higher sales in emerging growth markets and increased sales of equipment in North America.
Operating earnings of $21.7 million in the quarter declined $17.4 million from 2008 levels primarily due to the lower sales volumes, costs to carry manufacturing capacity in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts, and $4.2 million of higher restructuring costs mainly to improve the segments cost structure in Europe. These impacts on operating earnings were partially offset by contributions from ongoing efficiency and productivity (collectively, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives, benefits from restructuring and other cost reductions (including material costs) and savings from cost containment actions.
operating earnings in the fourth quarter increased $3.9 million sequentially over third-quarter 2009 levels on $4.6 million of higher sales.
Snap-on Tools Group
Segment sales of $251.2 million in the quarter declined $1.2 million, or 0.5%, from 2008 levels; excluding $8.5 million of foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 3.7%.
Operating earnings of $33.2 million, or 13.2% of sales, in the quarter, improved from $19.8 million, or 7.8% of sales, last year. The $13.4 million increase in year-over-year operating earnings was primarily due to lower restructuring costs, contributions from ongoing RCI initiatives, benefits from prior restructuring programs, and savings from material cost reductions and other cost containment actions. These improvements were partially offset by the lower level of organic sales.
operating earnings in the fourth quarter declined $0.7 million sequentially from third-quarter 2009 levels on $2.9 million of lower sales.
Diagnostics & Information Group
Segment sales of $129.1 million in the quarter declined $23.8 million, or 15.6%, from 2008 levels; excluding $1.9 million of foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 16.6%. The year-over-year sales decrease is primarily due to lower facilitation program, essential tools and electronic parts catalog sales to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) dealerships.
Operating earnings of $30.0 million in the quarter declined from $34.3 million last year primarily due to the lower sales volumes. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the quarter improved to 23.2% as compared to 22.4% last year, primarily due to a more favorable sales mix of higher-margin diagnostics and software products and contributions from ongoing RCI and other cost containment initiatives. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 included $5.4 million of income from the adjustment of a pre-acquisition contingency acquired with Snap-on Business Solutions.
revenue of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter improved sequentially from $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2009, and the fourth-quarter 2009 operating loss of $3.8 million also improved sequentially from an operating loss of $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2009. Financial services revenues of $6.7 million in the quarter declined $13.0 million from 2008 levels.
Financial Services
As previously communicated, on July 16, 2009, Snap-on terminated the financial services operating agreement that it had with CIT Group Inc. (CIT) relating to the parties Snap-on Credit LLC (SOC) joint venture. The change from recognizing gains on contracts sold to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on-book finance portfolio, was a primary factor in the fourth quarter operating loss of $3.8 million, as compared to operating income of $8.9 million in the 2008 fourth quarter. Snap-on expects that operating income from financial services, which is before interest expense, will improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows. Snap-on estimates the incremental cash requirements for SOC will approximate $300 million over the next 12 months.
On January 8, 2010, Snap-on filed a notice of arbitration concerning a dispute with CIT relating to various underpayments made during the course of the joint venture, in which Snap-on has alleged damages of approximately $115 million. As a result of the dispute, Snap-on has withheld certain amounts (totaling $81.5 million) from payments made to CIT relating to ongoing business activities. On January 29, 2010, CIT filed its response denying Snap-ons claim and asserting certain claims against Snap-on for other matters relating to the joint venture. CITs claim alleges damages in excess of $110 million, which sum includes return of the $81.5 million withheld by Snap-on. The amount retained by Snap-on is included in other accrued liabilities in Snap-ons January 2, 2010 consolidated balance sheet. At this early stage, no determination can be made as to the likely outcome of this dispute.
expenses of $13.7 million in the fourth quarter increased $9.1 million from prior-year levels primarily due to higher stock-based incentive compensation expense and $3.0 million of higher pension expense primarily as a result of declines in pension asset values.
Corporate
Outlook
Snap-on believes that it will realize further benefits in 2010 from its RCI, sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives, including approximately $25 million of year-over-year savings from its 2009 restructuring activities. Snap-on also anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging growth markets. Snap-on currently expects to incur approximately $18 million to $22 million of restructuring costs in 2010 primarily to improve the companys cost structure in Europe. In 2010, Snap-on expects to incur $5 million per quarter of higher pension expense largely due to the amortization of prior-year investment losses related to the companys U.S. pension plan assets. Capital expenditures in 2010 are anticipated to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million. For 2010, Snap-on anticipates that its effective income tax rate will approximate 33.5%.
In 2010, Snap-on intends to continue aggressively managing the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented or planned; the challenges of the current global economy make it difficult to presently predict this balance.
