In the second quarter of 2010, Snap-on Incorporated ("Snap-on" or "the company") realigned its segments as a result of the previously announced management organization change in an effort to better support the product and service needs of the company's primary customer segments. These customer segments include: i) commercial and industrial customers, including professionals in critical industries and emerging markets; ii) professional technicians who purchase products through the company's worldwide mobile tool distribution network; and iii) other professional customers related to automotive repair, including owners and managers of independent and Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") dealership service and repair shops. In addition, Snap-on's Financial Services customer segment offers financing options that include i) loans to franchisees' customers and Snap-on's industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools, equipment and diagnostics products on an extended-term payment plan; and ii) business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees.
The primary organizational changes included the realignment of the company's equipment products and equipment repair services operations from the Commercial & Industrial Group to the newly created Repair Systems & Information Group in order to better serve customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace, including owners and managers of independent and OEM dealership service and repair shops. In addition to equipment products and equipment repair services, the Repair Systems & Information Group includes the business operations of the company's former Diagnostics & Information Group, consisting of those operations providing diagnostics, vehicle service information, business management systems, electronic parts catalogs, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace. As previously disclosed, the company created a new position that reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the Repair Systems & Information Group. The organizational changes also included the realignment of the company's sales operations in Japan from the Snap-on Tools Group to the Commercial & Industrial Group to assist in further penetrating the customer base, particularly industrial buyers, in that region. The company also reallocated certain costs between the operating units as a result of the organizational changes discussed above, reflecting value-added activities and contributions related to the particular customer base being served.
As a result of these changes, Snap-on's business segments were realigned to reflect the current organizational structure used by the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Thus, Snap-on's reportable business segments are: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap-on Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services.
As stated above, the new segment reporting structure aligns with Snap-on's primary customer segments. The Commercial & Industrial Group serves commercial and industrial customers, including professionals in critical industries and emerging markets, through direct and distributor channels. The Snap-on Tools Group serves professional automotive technicians who purchase products through the Snap-on mobile tool distribution network. The Repair Systems & Information Group serves other professional automotive-related customers, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealers, through direct and distributor channels. The Financial Services customer segment offers financing options that include i) loans to franchisees' customers and Snap-on's industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools, equipment and diagnostics products on an extended-term payment plan; and ii) business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees.
Snap-on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on revenues and operating earnings. The company accounts for intersegment sales based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment's operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash held at Financial Services), deferred income taxes, pension assets and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at Snap-on's consolidated financial results.
