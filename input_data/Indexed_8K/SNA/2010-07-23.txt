Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Second Quarter 2010 Results
Operating earnings before financial services increases 47.1% on 9.8% sales increase;
Financial services transition continues on track;
EPS of $0.78 for the second quarter
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 23, 2010--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users, today announced operating results for the second quarter of 2010.
Sales of $647.6 million increased $57.6 million, or 9.8%, from 2009 levels, including $0.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
Gross profit of $303.8 million improved to 46.9% of sales compared with 43.1% a year ago.
Operating earnings before financial services of $79.0 million increased $25.3 million, or 47.1%, from prior-year levels and, as a percentage of sales, improved to 12.2% compared with 9.1% a year ago.
Financial services operating earnings of $1.7 million in the quarter improved from a loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2010. Financial services operating earnings were $16.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. The expected year-over-year decline resulted from the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture with CIT Group Inc.
The effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 31.2% in 2010 compared with 31.9% in 2009.
Net earnings of $45.3 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, increased from $37.4 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, a year ago despite $11.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, of lower financial services net earnings.
"Our second quarter results provide further testament to the benefits we continue to realize through our unwavering commitment to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. Were encouraged by the higher sales and operating margins on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, particularly since the shape of the global economic recovery is still not yet fully evident. Furthermore, our financial services transition remains well on track as we realized positive operating income in that segment for the quarter. In addition, we believe were making significant progress on our most important strategic initiatives: to enhance the franchisee network, to expand in vehicle repair facilities, to extend in critical industries, and to build in emerging markets. We believe that our advancements in those areas place Snap-on in a strong position to take full advantage of the global economic recovery, however it occurs. As always, I wish to thank our franchisees and our associates worldwide for their significant second quarter achievements and ongoing commitment.
Segment Results
In the second quarter of 2010, as previously disclosed, Snap-on realigned its management organization and, as a result, its reportable business segments. This organizational change reflects our efforts to better support the product and service needs of the companys primary customer segments. The primary changes included the realignment of the companys equipment products and equipment repair services operations from the Commercial & Industrial Group to the newly created Repair Systems & Information Group. In addition to equipment products and equipment repair services, the Repair Systems & Information Group includes the business operations of the companys former Diagnostics & Information Group. The organizational changes also included the realignment of the companys sales operations in Japan from the Snap-on Tools Group to the Commercial & Industrial Group and the reallocation of certain costs between the operating units. Prior year segment financial data has been restated to reflect these reportable business segment realignments. For additional information, refer to the Form 8-K Snap-on filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 7, 2010.
segment sales of $258.7 million in the second quarter increased $46.6 million, or 22.0%, from 2009 levels, reflecting higher sales across all operating units, particularly those businesses serving critical industries and emerging markets. Excluding $0.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 22.5%.
Commercial & Industrial Group
Operating earnings of $25.5 million in the second quarter increased $23.2 million from 2009 levels largely due to the higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, savings from ongoing efficiency and productivity (collectively, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives, and benefits from prior restructuring actions. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 9.9% in the second quarter increased from 1.1% a year ago.
segment sales of $264.5 million in the second quarter increased $21.9 million, or 9.0%, from 2009 levels. Excluding $2.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 7.8%, including a 9.3% sales increase in the United States.
Snap-on Tools Group
Operating earnings of $33.0 million in the second quarter increased $7.5 million from 2009 levels primarily due to the higher sales and improved manufacturing utilization. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.5% in the second quarter increased from 10.5% a year ago.
segment sales of $205.9 million in the second quarter increased $7.9 million, or 4.0%, from 2009 levels. Excluding $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 4.7%. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, partially offset by anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America as a result of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) dealership consolidations.
Repair Systems & Information Group
Operating earnings of $40.0 million in the second quarter increased $7.1 million from 2009 levels primarily due to the higher sales and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 19.4% in the second quarter increased from 16.6% a year ago.
revenue of $13.9 million in the second quarter declined $11.7 million from prior-year levels but improved $4.2 million from first quarter 2010 levels. Operating income of $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2010 declined $14.9 million from prior-year levels but improved sequentially from an operating loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Financial Services
On July 16, 2009, Snap-on terminated its financial services operating agreement with CIT Group Inc. (CIT) relating to the parties Snap-on Credit LLC (SOC) joint venture. The change from recognizing gains on contracts sold to CIT, to recognizing the interest yield on the on-book finance portfolio, was a primary factor in the year-over-year decline in both financial services revenues and operating income. Snap-on expects that operating income from financial services, which is before interest expense, will continue to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows. Snap-on continues to expect that the full year incremental cash requirements for SOC in 2010 will approximate $300 million.
expenses of $19.5 million in the second quarter of 2010 increased $12.5 million from prior-year levels primarily due to higher long-term and current year performance-based incentive compensation expense, increased stock-based expense and higher pension expense.
Corporate
Outlook
Snap-on incurred $6.3 million of restructuring costs in the first six months of 2010, including $3.1 million in the second quarter, and presently expects that full-year 2010 restructuring costs will approximate $15 million. Snap-on also anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging growth markets. The company currently anticipates capital expenditures in full-year 2010 to be approximately $50 million, of which $12.3 million was incurred in the first six months of 2010. Snap-on presently expects to incur approximately $16 million of higher year-over-year pension expense in 2010. As a result of the favorable settlement of certain tax audits, the effective income tax rate for full-year 2010 is now expected to approximate 33.7%. Snap-on is encouraged by its financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2010 as well as with trends in certain markets and businesses; however, ongoing challenges remain in the current global economy. As a result, the company intends to continue its efforts of striking a balance between investing in and capturing growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented.
