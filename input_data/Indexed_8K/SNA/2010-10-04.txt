On October 1, 2010, certain subsidiaries of Snap-on Incorporated (Snap-on) entered into a loan and servicing agreement (the Loan Agreement) with a group of conduit lenders, committed lenders, administrative agents and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as program agent (the Agent), that provides for aggregate revolving credit commitments in the principal amount of up to $100 million (subject to borrowing base requirements).  The Loan Agreement provides Snap-on with additional available credit capacity and supplements Snap-ons existing $500 million of revolving credit facilities and $20 million of committed bank lines of credit.  As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, no amounts were outstanding under any of these credit facilities.
 
Pursuant to a receivables sale agreement dated as of October 1, 2010 (the Sale Agreement) between Snap-on Credit LLC (SOC), as seller, and SOC SPV1, LLC (SSL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SOC, SOC may from time to time convey receivables arising in the ordinary course of business of SOC and other subsidiaries of Snap-on (collectively, the Receivables) to SSL in exchange for cash.  Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, SSL granted a security interest in the Receivables to the Agent to secure the repayment of indebtedness that SSL may from time to time incur under the Loan Agreement. No borrowing took place on the closing date.  Unless earlier terminated or subsequently extended by the mutual agreement of SSL and the lenders, the Loan Agreement will expire on September 30, 2011, at which time SSLs ability to borrow will terminate and collections on the pledged Receivables will thereafter be applied periodically to the repayment of outstanding loans under the Loan Agreement.  Any amounts remaining outstanding under the Loan Agreement as of October 1, 2013 (or, if earlier, the date that is one and one-half years following the final maturity date of the last maturing Receivable owned by SSL as of the earlier of September 30, 2011 and an Event of Termination (as defined in the Loan Agreement)), will become due and payable on such date.
 
Any borrowings under the Loan Agreement will be accounted for as a financing obligation on Snap-ons consolidated financial statements.  SOC will retain servicing responsibility for any Receivables conveyed pursuant to the Sale Agreement.
 
The lenders under the Loan Agreement have no recourse to Snap-on or any of its affiliates (other than SSL) for repayment of loans under the Loan Agreement.  In addition, neither Snap-on nor SOC, nor any of their respective affiliates, have guaranteed the collectability of the Receivables or the creditworthiness of the obligors under the Receivables.
 
The Loan Agreement provides for interest on loans based on prevailing commercial paper rates or, to the extent the advance is not funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper, LIBOR, in each case plus a specified margin.
 
The Loan Agreement contains customary early amortization events and events of termination (with grace periods where customary), including, among other things, failure to pay interest or principal when due, change in control of Snap-on and insolvency events.
 
A copy of each of the Loan Agreement and the Sale Agreement is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and is incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K.

After default by the Customer on any obligation under Leases accepted by Snap-on Credit, if Snap-on Credit determines in its sole and absolute discretion that repossession or recovery of Products or other collateral securing a Customer's obligations is impractical or uneconomical, or, if the Sale Proceeds in connection with resale of repossessed Products associated with the defaulted Lease are less than the Outstanding Balance, then Franchisee shall pay, on demand by Snap-on Credit (or on demand by Snap-on if Snap-on Credit assigns its rights to collect such Lease to Snap-on), up to 20% of the Outstanding Balance of that Lease.  In the event such Lease includes tools and equipment which are not Products, as defined in this Agreement, the Outstanding Balance Due shall be prorated, such that Franchisees share of any loss shall be limited to the pro rata share associated with the Products. The percentage of loss sharing on Leases shall be determined in the manner described in the Program Manual.  Franchisee authorizes Snap-on Credit to cause Snap-on to charge the Reserve Account for any amount due under Section 11 or this Section 12.  Franchisee promptly shall pay to Snap-on Credit any remaining amounts owed; and Franchisee authorizes Snap-on Credit to cause Snap-on to charge Franchisee's Weekly Invoice for such amount, including charging Franchisees Weekly Invoice under any current or subsequent Snap-on Franchise.
(b)         In the event Snap-on Credit thereafter collects any portion of such Franchisee Paper or Lease, Snap-on Credit shall pay or cause Snap-on to credit Franchisee's Weekly Invoice 25% for Franchisee Paper and up to 20%, or such lesser amount as set forth in the Program Manual for Leases, of the amounts received, after deducting all costs of collection, up to the total recourse amount paid to Snap-on Credit by Franchisee in relation to the defaulted Franchisee Paper or Lease.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to impose on Snap-on Credit any duty whatsoever to collect amounts outstanding on any Franchisee Paper or Lease.
      .

Security Requirement - Franchisee Reserve Account
(a)         To secure Franchisee's performance of obligations under this Agreement, upon Snap-on Credit's acceptance of Franchisee Paper or Lease, Franchisee shall deliver to Snap-on Credit (or Snap-on Credit may retain) the Reserve Requirement for that Franchisee Paper or Lease, which amount will be credited to the Reserve Account and deducted from the payments or credits issued by Snap-on Credit to Franchisee with respect to Franchisee's Weekly Invoice.  Franchisee authorizes Snap-on Credit to cause Snap-on to charge this amount on Franchisee's Weekly Invoice.  Amounts credited to the Reserve Account may be commingled with Snap-on's general funds and there is no obligation to pay interest on such amounts.  If Snap-on chooses to pay interest on such amounts, Snap-on Credit shall cause Snap-on to credit Franchisee with interest on the total amount in the Reserve Account as of the month-end closing date at the rate of interest that Snap-on may determine from time to time.
 
Exhibit I-1-11
 
(b)         To secure Franchisee's performance of obligations under this Agreement, Franchisee further grants Snap-on Credit a security interest in all of the following property of Franchisee, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, and whether tangible or intangible:  inventory, consigned inventory, tools, equipment, vans, accounts, business deposit accounts, contract rights, general intangibles, chattel paper, Revolving Accounts, Extended Credit contracts, Credit Sale Contracts, Open Accounts, Leases, insurance policies, documents, deposits, Franchisee's Reserve Account(s), Franchisee's Business Investment Account, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, books, records, catalogues, sales aids, computers, computer programs and data, and any replacements, substitutions, additions, accessions or proceeds thereof.  This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. On execution of this Agreement, and as otherwise reasonably required by Snap-on Credit, Franchisee shall sign any documents requested by Snap-on Credit for the purpose of evidencing or perfecting its security interest and shall cooperate with Snap-on Credit in making appropriate UCC filings to perfect that security interest. Further, to the extent permitted by and subject to applicable law, Franchisee hereby grants Snap-on or its agent or assigns the power of attorney and right to sign on behalf of Franchisee and file or record, any and all such financing statements and related documents as may be necessary to perfect or maintain the security interest granted by Franchisee under this Agreement, all the forgoing, collectively, the Collateral).  Franchisee authorizes Snap-on Credit the right to describe the Collateral in any financing statement as all business assets.  This statement in any financing statement shall not expand or limit the property given as security for performance of obligations under this Agreement as described above.
(c)         If Franchisee fails to timely perform any obligation contained in this Agreement, Snap-on Credit shall have the immediate right (and may cause Snap-on or an Affiliate) to set-off and deduct the amount of that obligation on the Franchisee's Weekly Invoice and to deduct the amount from any other moneys Snap-on Credit or Snap-on or an Affiliate may hold with respect to or may owe Franchisee.  If the amount in the Reserve Account and/or the Weekly Invoice balance is not paid in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of any obligation, then Franchisee shall pay to Snap-on Credit on demand any remaining amounts owed.
(d)         Provided that Franchisee is not in default under the Franchise Agreement and that there is no existing breach by Franchisee of any representation or warranty in this Agreement, the amount by which the total credit in the Reserve Account exceeds 15% (or such lesser amount as Snap-on Credit may designate from time to time) of the total combined Outstanding Balance of all Franchisee Paper collected or serviced by Franchisee will be returned to Franchisee, at such times as Snap-on Credit may determine, and may be credited to Franchisee's Weekly Invoice.
(e)         Snap-on Credit may apply the Reserve Account to any indebtedness due or which may become due from Franchisee to Snap-on Credit or any affiliate until 60 days after termination of the Franchisee Agreement or for such longer period as may be reasonably necessary to properly compute such indebtedness.
      .  No waiver by any party of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement or of any subsequent breach by any other party of the same or another provision.  Any party's consent to, or approval of, any act shall not be deemed to render unnecessary the obtaining of such party's consent to or approval of any subsequent act.

Dispute Resolution
(a)         .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 15.(e) below, any controversy or dispute arising out of, or relating to the termination of the Franchise or the termination or nonrenewal of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim by Franchisee, or any person in privity with or claiming through Franchisee must be submitted to non-binding mediation prior to any matter being submitted to arbitration.  This provision applies only to controversies and disputes that are specific to Franchisee, or any person in privity with or claiming through Franchisee and not to issues that effect Snap-on franchisees generally. Any such mediation will be held within 30 days after a demand for mediation is made by either party by notice to the other party.  The mediation will be conducted in the state in which Franchisee resides.
Mediation
  The mediator will be someone knowledgeable with the Snap-on business.  Franchisee may be accompanied at the mediation by anyone of Franchisees choosing.  If Franchisee elects not to be represented by counsel, Snap-on Credit will also participate in the mediation without counsel.  Snap-on Credit or Snap-on will pay the costs of the mediator and location at which the mediation takes place.
(b)         .  Except as otherwise provided in Section 15(e) below, any controversy or dispute arising out of, or relating to the Franchise or this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim by Franchisee, or any person in privity with or claiming through, on behalf of or in the right of Franchisee, concerning the entry into, performance under, nonrenewal of, or termination of, this Agreement; any claim against a past or present employee, officer, director, agent or affiliate of Snap-on Credit; any claim of breach of this Agreement or any agreement between the parties or their respective affiliates (whether existing before or after this Agreement); and any claims arising under state or federal laws, including any statutes, rules, or regulations, shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration as the sole and exclusive remedy for any such controversy or dispute.  As a condition of submitting a controversy or dispute regarding the termination of the Franchise or the termination or nonrenewal of this Agreement to arbitration, the parties must have participated in and failed to resolve the controversy or dispute through mediation, or the party filing the arbitration has made himself available to participate, but the party against whom the arbitration is filed refused to participate or otherwise failed to make himself available to participate in the mediation process within the prescribed time.  Unless prohibited by applicable law, any claim shall be made by filing a written demand for arbitration within one (1) year following the conduct, act or other event or occurrence first giving rise to the claim; otherwise, the right to any remedy shall be forever barred.  Persons in privity with or claiming through, on behalf of or in the right of Franchisee include, but are not limited to, spouses and other family members, heirs, executors, representatives, successors and assigns.  In no event shall persons in privity include other Snap-on franchisees who have signed separate franchise agreements with Snap-on, unless all of those franchisees are under the common control of the same person or entity.  
Agreement to Arbitrate
FRANCHISEE AND SNAP-ON CREDIT ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY COURT PROCEEDING.
 
Exhibit I-1-13
 
(c)         .  The right and duty of the parties to this Agreement to resolve any disputes by arbitration shall be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act, as amended, and arbitration shall take place according to the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the date the demand for arbitration is filed.  The arbitration shall be held at the office of the American Arbitration Association nearest the Snap-on Regional Sales Office to which Franchisee was assigned most recently prior to the demand for arbitration; provided, however, if such office is outside the state in which the Franchisee resides, Franchisee may cause the arbitration to be held within the Franchisees state of residence at a place mutually convenient to the parties and the arbitrator.  The arbitration shall proceed before a single arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall be chosen by the striking method from a panel of neutral arbitrators provided by the American Arbitration Association.  If the amount claimed by the party filing for arbitration both in the original demand for arbitration and in any amendment is less than Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), Snap-on Credit shall pay the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and shall also pay the filing fees and costs charged by the American Arbitration Association up to a maximum of Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($7,500.00).  Any amount in excess of Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($7,500.00) will be split equally by the parties.  If the amount of the claim filed either in the original demand for arbitration or by amendment is for Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) or more, the parties agree to split equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the filing fees and costs charged by the American Arbitration Association.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the arbitrator, pre-hearing discovery in any arbitration is limited to the following:  (1) production of all documents that will be introduced at the hearing; (2) production of written or recorded statements; (3) production of all documents relied upon by experts in the hearing; (4) production by Franchisee of tax returns filed by Franchisee for the last three (3) tax years; and (5) not more than two depositions per side.
Procedures for Arbitration
(d)         .  Each party further agrees that, unless such a limitation is prohibited by applicable law, the other party shall not be liable for punitive or exemplary damages and that the arbitrator shall have no authority to award the same.  The award or decision by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may be enforced by judgment or order of a court having subject matter jurisdiction in the state where the arbitration took place.  The parties consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over them by such courts for the purpose of carrying out this provision; and they waive any objections that they would otherwise have to the same.  Unless prohibited by applicable law, (i) no arbitration under Section 15 shall include, by consolidation, joinder, class action or in any other manner, any person other than Franchisee and Snap-on Credit and any other person in privity with or claiming through, in the right of or on behalf of Franchisee or Snap-on Credit, unless both Franchisee and Snap-on Credit consent in writing, and (ii) no finding or stipulation of fact in any other arbitration, judicial or similar proceeding shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder, and no conclusion of law in any other arbitration shall be given any weight in any arbitration hereunder, except to the extent such finding, stipulation or conclusion may have been determined in another proceeding between Franchisee and Snap-on Credit or any person in privity with or claiming through, in the right of or on behalf of Franchisee or Snap-on Credit.  The parties agree to arbitrate only controversies and disputes that are specific to Franchisee or any person in privity with or claiming through Franchisee and not issues that effect franchisees generally.  In the event any provision in this Section 15, other than the prohibition against consolidation, joinder and class action, is determined to be legally invalid or unenforceable under the law applicable in a particular case, then it is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that such provision be deemed inoperative and stricken from this Agreement, and that the remainder of this Section 15, to the extent not legally invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, be enforced as written and as if the invalid or unenforceable provision or provisions had not been included in this Section 15.  If the prohibition against consolidation, joinder and class action is determined to be legally invalid or unenforceable in a particular case, then it is the intent of the parties that the case shall proceed only in any federal court of competent jurisdiction, or in the event there is no jurisdiction in a federal court, then in that situation only, the case shall proceed in a state court of competent jurisdiction.
Limitation on Damages, Enforceability
 
Exhibit I-1-14
 
(e)         . Each party shall have the right to seek from an appropriate court provisional remedies including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or replevin orders before, during or after arbitration.  Neither party need await the outcome of the arbitration before seeking provisional remedies.  Seeking any such remedies shall not be deemed to be a waiver of either party's right to compel arbitration.  Any such action shall be brought by Snap-on Credit or Franchisee in the county (or similar political unit) or federal judicial district where Franchisee resides, or where any property that may be the subject of the action is located.  The parties consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over them by courts located there and to the propriety of venue in such courts for the purpose of carrying out this provision; they waive any objections that they would otherwise have to the same; and they waive the right to have any such action decided by a jury.
Provisional Remedies
     .  Franchisee waives notice of default or nonpayment, protest or notice of protest, demand for payment and any other demand or notice in connection with any Franchisee Paper, Lease or this Agreement.  Franchisee agrees that so long as Snap-on Credit in good faith believes that it is appropriate to do so under the circumstances, Snap-on Credit may waive, compromise, settle, or vary any terms of any Franchisee Paper or Lease purchased by Snap-on Credit, or permit these events to occur by operation of law, without limiting or otherwise affecting Franchisee's obligations under this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Franchisee's recourse obligations set forth in Sections 11 and 12 shall not be terminated, modified or affected in any way by such actions, and Franchisee hereby consents to all such actions.  No termination of this Agreement shall affect Franchisee's recourse obligations with respect to any Franchisee Paper or Lease purchased by Snap-on Credit prior to such termination.
16.
Waiver of Notice of Nonpayment, Protest; Default and Demands
     .  All or any portion of this Agreement, or of any Franchisee Paper or Leases purchased by Snap-on Credit, and all or any portion of the rights under the foregoing, may be assigned or transferred in whole or in part by Snap-on Credit or an Affiliate in its sole and absolute discretion at any time.  Franchisee may not assign or delegate any rights or duties hereunder without the express written consent of Snap-on Credit. Franchisee may not assign or delegate any rights or duties hereunder to any employee.  Franchisee shall remain responsible for the actions and omissions of any employee.  This Agreement inures to the benefit of and binds the respective heirs, executors, administrators, representatives, and permitted successors and assigns of Snap-on Credit and Franchisee.
17.
Successors and Assigns
     .  The term of this Agreement shall be 10 years from the Effective Date or for the remaining term of the Franchisees Franchise Agreement, which ever is less, unless terminated sooner according to Sections 19 or 20 of this Agreement.  If Franchisee renews, updates, or converts a Franchise Agreement with Snap-on in accordance with their agreement with Snap-on, the Franchisee shall also execute the then-current form of this Agreement.
18.
Term and Renewal of this Agreement
 
Exhibit I-1-15
 
      .  Franchisee may terminate this Agreement without cause by providing Snap-on Credit thirty (30) days' advance written notice of Franchisee's intent to terminate.

20.
Termination by Snap-on Credit
(a)       . Franchisee shall be deemed to be in default under this Agreement and Snap-on Credit will without prejudice to any and all other rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement or under applicable law, terminate this Agreement without notice to Franchisee in the following instances:
Automatic Termination without Notice
(i)          If Franchisee is adjudicated a bankrupt or becomes insolvent, or has a trustee or receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction for all or any part of Franchisee's property; or
(ii)         If a plan of liquidation, reorganization, composition or arrangement of Franchisee's affairs is sought to be instituted for or against Franchisee, whether or not the same is subsequently approved by a court of competent jurisdiction; or
(iii)        If a proceeding is filed under any bankruptcy laws or other similar laws and such proceeding is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after filing; or
(iv)        If Franchisee makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or
(v)         If Franchisee shall cease to be an authorized Snap-on franchisee because of the termination of, or the transfer or assignment of rights under, the Franchise Agreement between Franchisee and Snap-on (or an affiliate thereof).  A Franchisee does not cease being an authorized Snap-on Franchisee if Franchisee becomes a Standard Franchisee after having been a Gateway Franchisee or otherwise remains a Franchisee under a different franchise agreement; or
(vi)        Upon the death or incapacity of Franchisee (or the stockholder of a corporate Franchisee).
(b)       .  Franchisee shall be deemed in default under this Agreement and Snap-on Credit may, at its option, without prejudice to any and all other rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement or under applicable law, terminate this Agreement effective upon Franchisee's receipt of written notice of termination, in the following instances:
Termination upon Notice
(i)          If Franchisee falsifies any report, Franchisee Paper or Lease required to be furnished Snap-on Credit, or engages in conduct involving dishonesty in dealing with Snap-on Credit; or
(ii)         If any representation or warranty of Franchisee contained in this Agreement or in any document or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement is untrue or incorrect; or
(iii)        If Franchisee remains in default beyond the applicable cure period under any other written agreement with Snap-on Credit or Snap-on (or any subsidiary or affiliate of Snap-on); or
(iv)        If Franchisee has received two (2) or more notices of default under Section 20(c) below within the previous twelve (12) months or within the previous six months Franchisee submits two or more collection remittances that are returned for insufficient funds, Snap-on Credit shall be entitled to send Franchisee a notice of termination upon the next default of Franchisee without providing Franchisee an opportunity to correct the default and/or require that all Franchisee remittance hereunder be on certified funds; or
(v)         If Franchisee defaults by failing to maintain the delinquency requirements established under Section 8(d) under this Agreement and fails to cure such default within 60 days after notice of such condition.
 
Exhibit I-1-16
 
(c)       .  Except for those items listed in preceding Sections 20(a) and (b), Franchisee shall have thirty (30) days (or longer, if such default cure period is specifically provided for in the Program Manual) after written notice of default from Snap-on Credit within which to remedy any default or breach under this Agreement, or any other written agreement with Snap-on Credit, and provide evidence of that remedy to Snap-on Credit.  If any such default is not cured within that time, this Agreement shall terminate without further notice to Franchisee effective immediately upon expiration of that time, unless Snap-on Credit shall notify Franchisee otherwise in writing.  Without limiting the foregoing, the following defaults are within this Section 20(c):
Termination upon Expiration of Cure Period
(i)          Failure by Franchisee to comply with any of the requirements imposed by this Agreement, as supplemented by the Program Manual from time to time to which Snap-on Credit may contribute Program procedures, or to carry out the terms of this Agreement in good faith; or
(ii)          Failure of Franchisee to submit when required any reports; or
(iii)         Failure to adhere to the electronic commerce requirements of Snap-on Credit (including, but not limited to, electronic remittance of collections and utilization of electronic Credit Sale Contracts);
(d)       Notwithstanding the provisions of preceding Section 20(c), if Franchisee defaults in the payment of any monies owed to Snap-on Credit when such monies become due and payable, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and Franchisee fails to pay such monies within ten (10) days after receiving written notice of default, then, unless Snap-on Credit shall notify Franchisee otherwise in writing, this Agreement shall terminate without prejudice to any and all other rights and remedies Snap-on Credit may have under this Agreement or under applicable law.
      .  If an Event of Default or Termination under this Agreement shall occur, then Snap-on Credit may, at its option, exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies:
21.
Effect of Termination on Franchisees Rights and Obligations
(a)         Snap-on Credit will not purchase Franchisee Paper or Leases from Franchisee hereunder after termination of this Agreement.
(b)         All obligations, warranties and agreements with respect to any Franchisee Paper or Lease delivered to Snap-on Credit by Franchisee before such termination shall remain in full force and effect, including, without limitation the provisions of Section 12 above, and Franchisee shall remain liable for the performance of all obligations to Customer and Snap-on Credit incurred while this Agreement was in effect notwithstanding such termination, including but not limited to, collection repossession and purchase requirements.
(c)         In the event the Franchise is terminated for any reason, Franchisee immediately shall pay Snap-on Credit all sums due and owing hereunder.
(d)         Except as may otherwise be required by law, in the event the Franchise is terminated for any reason or if an Event of Default occurs, and Franchisee fails to immediately pay Snap-on Credit all sums due and owing hereunder, Snap-on Credit (i) may sell all or any of the Collateral at public or private sale or sales upon such terms and conditions as Snap-on Credit deems proper (and Snap-on Credit may purchase any or all of the Collateral at any such sale), and apply the net proceeds of such sale, after deducting all costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred at any time in the collection of Franchisees obligations under this Agreement and in the protection and sale of the Collateral, first to the payment of Franchisees obligations under this Agreement and then to the payment of any other liabilities of Franchisee to Snap-on Credit, and shall return any remaining proceeds to Franchisee; provided that Franchisee shall remain liable for any Franchisees obligations or other amounts remaining unpaid after such application and interest thereon; and (b) may take such other actions as it may deem appropriate or in its interest with respect to the Collateral including, without limitation, (i) transferring the whole or any part of the Collateral into its name or the name of a nominee, (ii) collecting any amounts due on the Collateral directly from the persons obligated thereon, (iii) exercising any voting or other rights with respect to any Collateral consisting of securities, (iv) taking possession and control of the Collateral and any proceeds thereof and (v) suing or making any compromise or settlement with respect to any of the Collateral.
 
Exhibit I-1-17
 
(e)         Snap-on Credit may exercise from time to time any rights and remedies available to it under all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the UCC and the commercial code of any other applicable state.  In addition to and not in limitation of all rights of offset that Snap-on Credit may have under applicable law, Snap-on Credit shall, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or termination of this Agreement, have the right to appropriate and apply to the payment of and to set-off against Franchisees obligations any and all balances, credits, accounts or money of Franchisee then or thereafter received or held by or under the control of Snap-on Credit.  Except as may otherwise be required by law, including with respect to notice of any sale of Collateral, Franchisee hereby waives, in connection with this Agreement and Franchisees obligations under this Agreement, any right under or benefit of any law (whether or not intended for its advantage or protection) that would restrict or limit the right or ability of Snap-on Credit to obtain payment of Franchisees obligations under this Agreement, including any law that would restrict or limit Snap-on Credit in the exercise of right to appropriate at any time hereafter any indebtedness owing from Snap-on Credit to Franchisee and any property of Franchisee in the possession or control of Snap-on Credit and apply the same toward or set-off the same against the payment of Franchisees obligations under this Agreement.  All rights of Snap-on Credit under this Agreement are cumulative.
 
     . This Agreement may only be amended by a writing executed by Franchisee and Snap-on Credit; provided, however, that the Program Manual may be amended by Snap-on Credit as provided in Section 4 above.  Snap-on Credit reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to amend, terminate or supplement all or any part of its Programs at any time, and specifically reserves the right to cease making further purchases of Franchisee Paper or Leases.
22.
Amendment or Modification
     .  It is Franchisee's sole decision whether to enter into this Agreement and become a participating Franchisee.  Entering into this Agreement is not required for Franchisee to continue as an authorized Snap-on franchisee.  Franchisee understands that he is free to secure financing of Customer purchases of Products or extend credit to Customers through other means. Likewise, it is Snap-on Credit's sole decision to buy Franchisee Paper or Leases from Franchisee.  Franchisee acknowledges that Snap-on Credit's purchase of any Franchisee Paper or Lease is good and sufficient consideration for all of Franchisee's obligations under this Agreement and the Program Manual.  Franchisee agrees that Snap-on Credit may obtain credit information about Franchisee, franchise operations information from Snap-on and, that Snap-on Credit may provide Franchisee credit information to Snap-on from time to time.
23.
Franchisee Option to Participate
     .  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to its conflicts of law provisions, provided, however, that in the event local law is applied it shall be the laws of the state in which Franchisee resides at the time this Agreement was executed, except to the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act shall apply in accordance with Section 15 above.
24.

Any invalid portion shall be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement as of the date upon which the ruling becomes final, if Franchisee is a party to such proceedings, or upon Franchisee's receipt of notice of nonenforceability from Snap-on Credit.
