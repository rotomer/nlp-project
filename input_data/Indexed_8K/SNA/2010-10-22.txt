Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Third Quarter 2010 Results
EPS of $0.80 for the third quarter, up 81.8% from $0.44 last year;
Operating earnings increase 72.1%;
Sales 12.3% higher than 2009
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 22, 2010--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users, today announced operating results for the third quarter of 2010.
Sales of $653.1 million increased $71.3 million, or 12.3%, from 2009 levels; excluding $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 13.4%.
Gross profit of $301.2 million improved to 46.1% of sales compared with 44.8% a year ago.
Consolidated operating earnings of $83.8 million increased 72.1% from 2009 levels. Operating earnings before financial services of $78.8 million were up 45.9% from 2009 and, as a percentage of sales, improved to 12.1% from 9.3% a year ago.
Financial services operating earnings of $5.0 million increased $10.3 million from third-quarter 2009, primarily due to the growth in Snap-on Credits on-book finance portfolio following the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture with CIT Group Inc.
The effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 34.4% in 2010 compared with 29.3% in 2009.
Net earnings of $46.5 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, increased from $25.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, a year ago.
"Were encouraged by our third quarter improvement, which we believe evidences solid progress on our strategic priorities, continuing benefits from the Snap-on Value Creation Processes and signs of further stabilization in the overall business environment, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. These results mark three quarters of higher sales and operating earnings, demonstrating a continuing trend of increasing operating strength. Nevertheless, we recognize that the economic recovery is fragile. We, therefore, remain disciplined in our operating approach and commitment to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, while continuing to focus on those strategic initiatives that we believe will place Snap-on in a strong position as we move forward. As testimony to our success in creating positive runway, we believe the ongoing efforts in connecting with customers and translating that insight into winning innovation contributed greatly to Snap-on being recognized as the overall best brand in six tool categories in 2010 survey of U.S. automotive technicians. Finally, I thank the people responsible for this progress, our franchisees and associates worldwide, for their significant third quarter achievements and ongoing commitment.

Segment Results
segment sales of $261.0 million in the third quarter increased $42.5 million, or 19.5%, from 2009 levels, reflecting continued higher sales across all operating units, with particular progress in those businesses serving strategic growth areas in critical industries and emerging markets. Excluding $3.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 21.2%.
Commercial & Industrial Group
Operating earnings of $30.6 million in the third quarter increased $21.1 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales, benefits from the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, including ongoing efficiency and productivity (collectively, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives, and savings from restructuring actions. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 11.7% in the third quarter increased from 4.3% a year ago.
segment sales of $258.7 million in the third quarter increased $25.3 million, or 10.8%, from 2009 levels. Excluding $0.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 10.7%, including a 12.8% sales increase in the United States.
Snap-on Tools Group
Operating earnings of $28.2 million in the third quarter declined $1.3 million from 2009 levels. The comparison to 2009 is impacted by $4.1 million of unfavorable year-over-year LIFO-related inventory valuation expense primarily as a result of benefits recorded last year. Contributions from higher sales and favorable currency effects in 2010 were more than offset by the LIFO impact and increased volume-related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 10.9% in the third quarter compared with 12.6% a year ago; adjusted for LIFO-related inventory effects, operating earnings as a percentage of sales was 11.1% in both periods.
segment sales of $207.4 million in the third quarter increased $15.5 million, or 8.1%, from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, and higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products, partially offset by the anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America as a result of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) dealership consolidations. Excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 10.1%.
Repair Systems & Information Group
Operating earnings of $41.7 million in the third quarter increased $11.2 million, or 36.7%, from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs, benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and savings from restructuring actions. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 20.1% in the third quarter increased from 15.9% a year ago.
operating earnings were $5.0 million on $17.2 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2010, as compared with an operating loss of $5.3 million on $6.0 million of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflects the companys growing on-book finance portfolio.
Financial Services
Since the July 16, 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with CIT Group Inc. (CIT), Snap-on is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit LLC (SOC) and SOC is recording the interest yield on the new on-book finance portfolio over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Prior to July 16, 2009, SOC sold substantially all new contract originations to CIT and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue. Snap-on expects that operating earnings from financial services, which is before interest expense, will continue to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows.
expenses of $21.7 million in the third quarter of 2010 increased $6.2 million from prior-year levels primarily due to higher pension expense and increased stock-based (mark-to-market) expense.
Corporate
Outlook
Snap-on presently expects that full-year 2010 restructuring costs will approximate $15 million. Snap-on also anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging growth markets. The company currently expects that full-year 2010 capital expenditures will be about $45 million. Snap-on also expects to incur approximately $16 million of higher year-over-year pension expense in 2010. Snap-on anticipates that the effective income tax rate for full-year 2010 will approximate 33.6%.
