On December 9, 2010, Snap-on Incorporated (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters listed therein (collectively, the "Underwriters") pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase, subject to and upon terms and conditions set forth therein, $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.250% Notes due 2018 (the "Notes").
The offering of the Notes closed on December 14, 2010.
The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of January 8, 2007, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and related officers' certificate which established the terms of the Notes. The descriptions of the Indenture, the officers' certificate and the Notes in this Current Report on Form 8-K are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture, the officers' certificate and the Notes, respectively.
The Company will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on January 15 and July 15, beginning on July 15, 2011, to holders of record on the preceding January 1 and July 1, as the case may be. Interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The 4.250% Notes due 2018 will mature on January 15, 2018, unless redeemed prior to that date.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated senior indebtedness of the Company. The Indenture includes covenants, including limitations on the Company's ability, subject to exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. The Indenture also provides for events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes automatically become due and payable.
All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed at the Company's option in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the Notes are subject to repurchase by the Company at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of all or a portion of the Company's $200 million 6.25% unsecured senior notes maturing in August 2011, financing of contract and finance receivables related to Snap-on Credit LLC, and possible acquisitions.
 
The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K pertaining to the Notes is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable. The Company agrees to pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r).
(b) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof, in the form approved by the Representatives and referred to in Schedule IV hereto and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, the State of New York or the federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.

(e) The Company shall have requested and Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, "comfort" letters, dated as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, respectively, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and that they have audited the consolidated financial information of the Company for the year ended January 2, 2010, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and stating in effect that:
(i) in their opinion the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
(ii) on the basis of their audit of the financial information for the year ended January 2, 2010, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and audit committee of the Company; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to January 2, 2010, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
(1) any audited financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form with applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the annual report on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act; and said audited financial statements are not in conformity with GAAP;
(2) (i) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited financial statements, included in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with GAAP, and (ii) the unaudited financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission.
(3) with respect to the period subsequent to October 2, 2010, there were any changes at the "cut-off date" specified therein (which date shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives) in the long-term debt of the Company, in the common stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders' equity of the Company or decrease in consolidated net current assets of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the October 2, 2010 unaudited consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from October 2, 2010 to the "cut-off date" specified therein (which date shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives), there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year; in consolidated net revenues or in total or per share amounts of net income of the Company, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
 
(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
References to the Final Prospectus in this Section 7(e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
(f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time other than those to which the Underwriters have not objected or have consented, as applicable, pursuant to Section 5 hereof) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the "comfort" letter or letters referred to in Section 7(e) or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial condition or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis the effect of which in any case referred to in Section 7(e)(i) or 7(e)(ii) is, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof after the Execution Time), the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time).
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 7 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 7 shall be delivered at the office of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, on the Closing Date.
8. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 7 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
 
9. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto and the Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 9(b) hereof). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the names of the Underwriters on the front and back covers of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and the statements set forth in the paragraph under the heading "Underwriting  Offering Price, Concessions and Reallowances" and in the paragraph under the heading "Underwriting  Stabilization" relating to stabilization activities in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and the Representatives confirm that such statements are correct.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under Section 9(a) or 9(b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in Section 9(a) or 9(b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (other than local counsel) for all indemnified parties) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably determined that use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
 
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9(d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this Section 9(d).

In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

Certain of the Company's obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Notes may be terminated if the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or eligible instruments sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all of the Notes, as described in the Indenture.
This Note is in the form of a Global Security as provided in the Indenture. If at any time the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this Note or if at any time the Depository for the Notes shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depository with respect to this Note.
