Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results
EPS of $0.99 for the quarter up 57% from $0.63 last year;
Operating earnings increase $29.5 million, or 43.8%, from fourth-quarter 2009 levels;
Fourth-quarter sales up 12.7% year over year
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 3, 2011--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks, today announced 2010 operating results for the fourth quarter and full year.
Sales of $696.9 million in the quarter increased $78.8 million, or 12.7%, from 2009 levels; excluding $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 13.6%.
Consolidated operating earnings of $96.9 million in the quarter increased 43.8%, from 2009 levels and, as a percentage of revenues, improved 270 basis points from 10.8% last year to 13.5% this year. Operating earnings before financial services of $87.5 million in the quarter were up 22.9% from 2009 and, as a percentage of sales, improved to 12.6% from 11.5% a year ago.
Financial services operating earnings of $9.4 million in the quarter increased $13.2 million from 2009 levels primarily due to the growth in Snap-on Credits on-book finance portfolio.
The fourth quarter 2010 effective income tax rate of 30.1% includes a $3.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, benefit resulting primarily from non-recurring tax items, including the December 2010 extension of certain federal tax incentives. The fourth quarter 2009 effective income tax rate was 31.4%.
Net earnings of $57.9 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $21.3 million from $36.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, a year ago.
Full year 2010 sales of $2.62 billion increased 10.9% from prior year levels. Net earnings of $186.5 million for the full year increased $52.3 million from 2009, despite $12.3 million of lower net earnings from financial services. Diluted earnings per share were $3.19 in 2010 and $2.32 last year.
Our fourth quarter performance represents evidence of Snap-ons continuing and significant progress. Were very encouraged by what we believe to be further strengthening of our strategic position along each of our runways for growth, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. We are also fortified by the benefits being realized from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes. As testimony to those gains, magazine recently selected Snap-ons Murphy, N.C. power tools manufacturing facility as one of the top 10 plants in North America. We believe this is another meaningful sign of our ongoing achievement on the long journey of continuous improvement.
IndustryWeek
Our fourth quarter results mark four consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvements in sales and earnings, demonstrating a trend of increasing overall strength. In that regard, we believe our investments are paying off in the strategic areas that will be decisive for growth going forward: enhancing the franchise network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets. Were making substantial moves on each of these runways, which we believe will position Snap-on to take full advantage of the abundant opportunities emerging before us. Finally, in 2010, we registered encouraging results for both the fourth quarter and full year; I thank our franchisees and associates worldwide for their dedication to Snap-on and their efforts and commitment that made it all possible.
Segment Results
segment sales of $281.5 million in the fourth quarter increased $35.6 million, or 14.5%, from 2009 levels, reflecting continued higher sales across all operating units, including in those businesses serving critical industries and emerging markets. Excluding $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 15.4%.
Commercial & Industrial Group
Operating earnings of $35.4 million in the fourth quarter increased $18.6 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs and benefits from ongoing efficiency and productivity (collectively, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI) initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.6% in the fourth quarter increased from 6.8% a year ago.
segment sales of $268.2 million in the fourth quarter increased $31.2 million, or 13.2%, from 2009 levels, driven by strong performance in the United States. Excluding $0.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 12.8%.
Snap-on Tools Group
Operating earnings of $25.8 million in the fourth quarter declined $7.3 million from 2009 levels, as contributions from higher sales were more than offset by $6.5 million of lower LIFO-related inventory valuation benefits and $4.5 million of higher restructuring costs. The higher LIFO-related benefits in 2009 resulted from inventory reductions and liquidations in response to the continued economic downturn. Including these impacts, operating earnings of 9.6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared with 14.0% a year ago.
segment sales of $231.8 million in the fourth quarter increased $30.0 million, or 14.9%, from 2009 levels, reflecting stronger activity with repair shop owners and managers, including higher sales of undercar equipment, diagnostics and Mitchell1 information products, and significantly increased facilitation program activity with automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) dealerships. Excluding $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 16.8%.
Repair Systems & Information Group
Operating earnings of $45.7 million in the fourth quarter increased $10.7 million, or 30.6%, from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales and benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and savings from restructuring actions. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 19.7% in the fourth quarter increased from 17.3% a year ago.
operating earnings were $9.4 million on $21.5 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared with an operating loss of $3.8 million on $6.7 million of revenue last year. The year-over-year improvement in operating earnings primarily reflects the growth in the companys on-book finance portfolio. Snap-on expects that operating earnings from financial services, which is before interest expense, will continue to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows.
Financial Services
expenses of $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $5.7 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher pension expense and increased performance-based and stock-based (mark-to-market) compensation expense, partially offset by savings from ongoing cost containment and other actions.
Corporate
Outlook
Snap-on anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments in 2011, including further expansion in emerging growth markets. As a result, capital expenditures are anticipated to be in a range of $55 million to $65 million. Snap-on also expects to incur $11 million of higher year-over-year pension expense in 2011 largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to its domestic pension plan assets. Interest expense on the $250 million of senior notes issued December 2010 will approximate $2.7 million per quarter in 2011. Snap-on anticipates that its full year 2011 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.0%.
