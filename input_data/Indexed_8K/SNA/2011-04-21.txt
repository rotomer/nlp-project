segment sales of $282.0 million in the first quarter increased $33.5 million, or 13.5%, from 2010 levels. Excluding $3.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 11.7%, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States.
Snap-on Tools Group
Operating earnings of $37.1 million in the period increased $10.1 million from 2010 levels as contributions from higher sales were partially offset by increased volume-related and other expenses and $2.7 million of higher restructuring costs.

Operating earnings of $42.8 million in the period increased $5.8 million, or 15.7%, from 2010 levels primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs and benefits from ongoing RCI and restructuring actions, partially offset by increased product development expenses.

operating earnings were $12.5 million on $25.8 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2011, as compared with an operating loss of $1.7 million on $9.7 million of revenue last year. The year-over-year increase in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflects the growth in the companys on-book finance portfolio.

expenses of $24.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 increased $6.5 million from prior-year levels primarily due to increased performance-based and stock-based (including mark-to-market) compensation expenses and anticipated higher pension expense.
Corporate
Outlook

As a result, the company now expects that capital expenditures in 2011 will approximate $65 million, of which $18.6 million was spent in the first quarter. Snap-on also expects to incur $11 million of higher year-over-year pension expense in 2011 largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to its domestic pension plan assets. Interest expense on the $250 million of senior notes issued in December 2010 will approximate $2.7 million per quarter in 2011. Snap-on anticipates that its full year 2011 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.0%.
