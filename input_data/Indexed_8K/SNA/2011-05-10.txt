As previously reported, Snap-on Incorporated (the "Company") filed a notice of arbitration with the American Arbitration Association on January 8, 2010, concerning a dispute with CIT Group Inc. ("CIT") relating to various underpayments made during the course of their financial services joint venture, in which the Company alleged damages of approximately $115 million. As a result of the dispute, the Company withheld certain amounts (totaling $107.8 million) from payments made to CIT relating to Snap-on Credit LLC's ongoing business activities. CIT filed its response denying the Company's claim and asserting certain claims against the Company for other matters relating to the joint venture on January 29, 2010. CIT's claims included alleged damages in excess of $110 million.
The $107.8 million retained by the Company was included in "Other accrued liabilities" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in its Form 10-Q filed April 21, 2011.
On May 5, 2011, the Company and CIT reached an amicable settlement of their respective claims. As a result, in its fiscal 2011 second quarter, the Company will record an $18.0 million pretax gain reflecting the settlement. The Company will return the remaining $89.8 million of cash to CIT, representing $107.8 million of cash previously withheld net of the $18.0 million settlement.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
