EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Second Quarter 2011 Results
Diluted EPS of $1.33;
Excluding arbitration settlement gain, diluted EPS of $1.14 up 46.2%;
Sales of $726.7 million up 12.2%
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 21, 2011--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks, today announced operating results for the second quarter of 2011.
Sales of $726.7 million increased $79.1 million, or 12.2%, from 2010 levels; excluding $30.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 7.2%.
Operating earnings before financial services of $98.8 million increased $19.8 million, or 25.1%, from 2010 levels and, as a percentage of sales, improved to 13.6% from 12.2% a year ago.
Financial services operating earnings of $35.5 million included a previously disclosed $18.0 million arbitration settlement gain and continued higher earnings from the growing on-book finance portfolio; financial services operating earnings in the second quarter of 2010 were $1.7 million.
Consolidated operating earnings of $134.3 million increased $53.6 million from 2010 levels; excluding the arbitration settlement gain, operating earnings of $116.3 million increased $35.6 million, or 44.1%, and improved to 15.4% of revenues from 12.2% last year.
The higher than anticipated second quarter 2011 effective income tax rate of 34.0% is primarily attributable to the mix of earnings, including the tax impact of the arbitration settlement gain that is taxable in the United States.
Net earnings in the second quarter of 2011 were $78.0 million or $1.33 per diluted share. Excluding the arbitration settlement, net earnings were $66.9 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, as compared with $45.3 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010.
We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, which we believe further illustrate the strength of Snap-ons value proposition to professional users performing critical tasks, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. As evidenced by the sales increases in the quarter, we continue to make substantial progress on our runways for coherent growth, and the improvement in our year-over-year operating income margin provides further testament to the power of Snap-ons Value Creation Processes. As always, I thank our franchisees and associates worldwide for their ongoing dedication and contributions.
