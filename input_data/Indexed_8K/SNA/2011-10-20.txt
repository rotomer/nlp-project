EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99
Snap-on Announces Third Quarter 2011 Results
Diluted EPS of $1.16;
Operating earnings of $115.1 million up 37.4%;
Sales of $697.2 million up 6.8%
KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 20, 2011--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks, today announced operating results for the third quarter of 2011.
Sales of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million, or 6.8%, from 2010 levels; excluding $19.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 3.6%.
Operating earnings of $115.1 million increased $31.3 million, or 37.4%, from 2010 levels, including $15.8 million of higher year-over-year earnings from financial services and $7.1 million of lower corporate expenses, largely due to favorable mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter.
The third quarter 2011 effective income tax rate of 31.7% was lower than anticipated primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.
Net earnings of $67.8 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $46.5 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, a year ago.
We are pleased with our results for the third quarter, which we believe provide further evidence of the progress being made along each of our runways for coherent growth: enhancing the franchise network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. As testimony to our success in creating positive runway, and to the effectiveness of our Snap-on Value Creation processes, we are honored to have been recognized by 2011 survey of U.S. automotive technicians as the overall best brand, by wide margins, in hand tools, diagnostics, tool storage, power tools and pneumatic/air tools. This overwhelming endorsement reflects our continuing progress in connecting with customers and translating the resulting insight into winning innovation. Finally, our third quarter reflects significant effort and achievement across the company and I thank our franchisees and associates worldwide for their continued contributions and commitment to our team.

segment sales of $279.6 million in the third quarter rose $20.9 million, or 8.1%, from 2010 levels; excluding $5.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales for the Group increased 6.0%.
Snap-on Tools Group

Operating earnings of $43.7 million in the period increased $2.0 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 19.6% in the third quarter compared with 20.1% a year ago.
operating earnings were $20.8 million on $32.7 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2011, as compared to operating earnings of $5.0 million on $17.2 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2010. The year-over-year increase in both revenues and operating earnings primarily reflects the continued growth of the on-book finance portfolio.
Financial Services
expenses of $14.6 million in the third quarter of 2011 decreased $7.1 million from prior-year levels. In the quarter, the change in the companys stock price resulted in $7.8 million of benefits related to stock-based (mark-to-market) compensation. Corporate expenses also included $3.1 million of expected higher year-over-year pension expense.
Corporate
Outlook
Snap-on continues to anticipate that capital expenditures in 2011 will approximate $65 million, of which $46.6 million was spent in the first nine months of 2011. We also expect to incur approximately $13 million of higher year-over-year pension expense in 2011 largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to our domestic pension plan assets. Snap-on now anticipates that its full year 2011 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.0%.
