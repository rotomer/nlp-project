Operating earnings before financial services of $96.2 million, including $12.2 million of higher year-over-year stock-based, mark-to-market expense, compares to $94.3 million last year.
Financial services operating earnings of $27.9 million increased $7.1 million from 2011 levels, reflecting the growth of the on-book finance portfolio.

We believe our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress along our defined runways for coherent growth: enhancing the franchise network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending into critical industries and building in emerging markets, said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. These results also underscore the way in which our commitment to the Snap-on Value Creation processes drives ongoing improvement in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. As further evidence of our success in connecting with customers and translating that insight into winning innovation, we are honored to have been recognized again in 2012 by both and with multiple awards for Snap-on products in each publication.
