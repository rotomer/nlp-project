Exhibit 99.1
     On Oct. 10, 2003, in the case involving SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Ritek Corporation, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted defendant Ritek Corporation's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. In its order, the court found that the accused Ritek CompactFlash memory cards did not infringe on SanDisk's patent, United States Patent No. 5,602,987 ("Flash EEPROM system"). The order does not affect the validity of the patent.
SUNNYVALE, CA, OCT. 13, 2003 
     Charles Van Orden, SanDisk vice president and general counsel, said, "SanDisk respectfully but strongly disagrees with the court's ruling and will immediately take steps to appeal the decision to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. SanDisk believes that the court incorrectly interpreted the claims of the patent and that the company has a strong basis for appeal."
     License obligations under SanDisk's existing licenses are not impacted by the court ruling and, accordingly, the company does not expect royalty income to be affected.
