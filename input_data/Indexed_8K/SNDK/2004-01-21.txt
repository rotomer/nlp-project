SANDISK ANNOUNCES RECORD FOURTH QUARTER REVENUES AND OPERATING EARNINGS ANNUAL REVENUES INCREASE 99% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO EXCEED $1 BILLION; ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 298% YEAR-OVER-YEAR SUNNYVALE, CA, January 21, 2004 -- SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2003. Total fourth quarter revenues grew 116% to $389 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2002 and increased 38% sequentially. Income from license and royalties grew to $36 million, up 63% from $22 million in the prior quarter. Fourth quarter net income was $88 million compared to $20 million and $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2002 and the third quarter of 2003, respectively. Earnings per share grew 262% for the fourth quarter of 2003 and were $0.94 per diluted share compared with $0.26 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2002. Total revenue for fiscal 2003 was $1.1 billion, up 99% from $541 million in 2002. Product revenues were $982 million, up 99% from $493 million in 2002. Net income was $169 million, compared to net income of $36 million in 2002. Earnings per share for fiscal 2003 were $2.03 per diluted share, which compared to net earnings of $0.51 per diluted share in 2002. "Our excellent performance in the fourth quarter capped an outstanding year for SanDisk," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation. "In the fourth quarter we were able to meet the strong surge in holiday season demand and increased our megabyte shipments by 39%, primarily from increased production of .13 micron NAND at our FlashVision joint venture. In the past two quarters alone, we shipped almost as many megabytes of flash memory as in the prior fifteen years combined. Royalty income increased dramatically in the fourth quarter, reflecting the industry-wide growth of flash memory shipments by our licensees. This is a testimony to the value of SanDisk's broad based patents in these growing markets." "I am grateful to our worldwide employees for their fantastic team execution, our global customers for making this our first billion dollar year, and our partners and suppliers. In particular, we are privileged to have Toshiba as our steadfast FlashVision joint venture partner. We are also appreciative of the excellent support we are receiving from Samsung in consistently meeting their supply commitments in the face of tight capacity."
"We are optimistic about our business prospects, based on projected continuing strong growth in our target markets for digital cameras and portable digital consumer electronics, the growing adoption of our cards in camera cell phones, and our growing market share in USB flash drives. Flash storage technology and product innovations are enabling numerous other emerging industrial, telecom, automotive and medical applications. Market research reports are forecasting flash cards to grow from $3.5 billion in 2003 to more than $10 billion by 2007. SanDisk is the market leader for flash cards worldwide and we believe we are exceptionally well positioned to be a major participant as this very large opportunity unfolds. We expect to face competition from new flash memory chip suppliers starting late in 2004 or in 2005. This will challenge us to relentlessly drive down our costs through our technology transitions and economies of scale, create new and exciting storage products, and expand our global sales reach and brand awareness among consumers."

SEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENT SanDisk separately announced today that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend to each stockholder of record at the close of business on February 3, 2004. BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR 2004 SanDisk is optimistic about business prospects in 2004 and expects: - Total annual revenues between $1.5 billion and $1.75 billion - License and royalty revenue of approximately $30 million per quarter with potential upside in the first and fourth quarters - Average change in selling price per megabyte comparable to the overall decline in 2003 rates at approximately 40%. Price declines are expected to be more moderate in the first half and in the second half of the year price declines are expected to reflect new capacity increases - Product gross margins in the first half of approximately 32-36%, and 28-32% in the second half - Operating expenses are expected to increase as the business grows and average approximately 15% of total revenues - Effective tax rate of approximately 37% - Capital equipment outlays of approximately $75 million primarily for SanDisk test equipment and $175 million in equipment loans to FlashVision. In the first quarter of 2004 SanDisk projects: - Modest seasonal decline in product revenues of 5%-10% sequentially. License and royalty revenues comparable with the fourth quarter of 2003 - Product gross margins of between 33% and 35% - Operating expense sequential growth of approximately 12%-14% due to volume increases, additional research and development hiring, and increases in marketing expenses. These projections could vary significantly depending on a number of factors primarily related to growth in demand and the growth in supply, both of which are difficult to forecast accurately for any particular quarter in 2004. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including our business outlook, expectations for new product introductions, capacity, future product revenues, average selling prices, gross margins, operating margins and tax rates, that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: market demand for our products that may grow more slowly than our expectations or a slower adoption rate for our products in new markets that we are targeting, fluctuations in operating results, yields and possible delays related to our planned conversion to 90 nanometer NAND flash currently planned to start in the second half of the year, any interruption of or delay in supply from any of the semiconductor manufacturing facilities that supply products to us, future average selling price erosion that may be more severe than our expectations due to possible excess industry capacity of flash memory either from existing
suppliers or from new competitors, price increases from non-captive flash memory sources and third-party subcontractors, higher than expected operating expenses due to unanticipated hiring and marketing expenses, higher than anticipated capital expenditures due to unexpected outlays for test equipment and FlashVision, adverse global economic and geo-political conditions, including adverse currency exchange rates, the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products that are based on the 90 nanometer NAND technology, fluctuations in license and royalty revenues, business interruption due to earthquakes or other natural disasters, particularly in areas in the Pacific Rim where we manufacture and assemble products, further impairment of our investments in Tower Semiconductor Ltd. due to any decline in stock valuations, and the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2003 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2002. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. We assume no obligation to update the information contained in this release.
