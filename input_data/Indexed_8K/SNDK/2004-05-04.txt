,  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced the appointment of Judy Bruner as Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.

"SanDisk's expectations for rapid growth in the coming years dictate that we bring in someone of Judy's financial and management skills to help us build our infrastructure, manage our growth and capture our opportunity to its fullest. Judy has brought tremendous strength to our Board, in particular the Audit Committee, in the past few years. While we will miss her on the Board, we are truly fortunate to have her join our executive staff. I am really happy and excited with this significant strengthening of our senior management team," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation.
     Judy Bruner has been a SanDisk Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board since 2002. She plans to step-down immediately from the Audit Committee and will step down from her Director position after a brief transition period.
 
     From 1999 until current, Ms. Bruner has served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Palm Inc. where she helped guide the company through the spin-off from 3Com and the Palm IPO, and then as CFO of palmOne with the spin-off of PalmSource and the acquisition of Handspring. Ms. Bruner has a diverse financial background with experience at both a start-up and large corporations including 3Com and Hewlett Packard.
     Bruner will assume her new role on June 21, 2004 as Michael Gray transitions out of his current role as CFO at SanDisk.
     "I would like to thank Michael Gray for his excellent support, hard work, and high integrity during these last 9 years," stated Eli. "Michael was instrumental in taking SanDisk public, raising equity financing, increasing SanDisk's visibility in the investment community and growing the company from about $50M when he started to over $1B in 2003 revenues. Mike leaves many friends at SanDisk and we wish him well as he spends time with his family before pursuing other career opportunities."

Exhibit 99.2
     SanDisk announced today that in the case involving SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK), defendant Ritek Corporation and defendant Pretec Electronics Corporation, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted defendant Pretec's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement on the same ground that summary judgment was previously granted for defendant Ritek Corporation in October 2003. The District Court's grant of summary judgment merely extends the effect of the Court's October 2003 order to Pretec CompactFlash memory cards. The order does not affect the validity of the patent in question, SanDisk's United States Patent No. 5,602,987.
SUNNYVALE, CA, May 3, 2004 
     The District Court's grant of summary judgment for Pretec applied the same claim construction that the District Court used in its October 2003 order granting summary judgment for defendant Ritek, a claim construction that SanDisk is in the process of appealing. In its order, the District Court expressly denied Pretec's attempt to expand the Court's October 2003 order to find non-infringement on the basis of new claim construction arguments. The Court declared that Pretec was barred from raising such new arguments in the future.
     Charles Van Orden, SanDisk vice president and general counsel, said, "As I stated in October 2003, SanDisk respectfully but strongly disagrees with the court's claim construction ruling. SanDisk is pleased that this order will clear the way for SanDisk to now move forward with its appeal with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. SanDisk strongly believes that the court incorrectly interpreted the claims of the 987 patent and that the company has a strong basis for appeal."
     As SanDisk stated in October 2003, license obligations under SanDisk's existing licenses are not impacted by the court ruling and, accordingly, the company does not expect royalty income to be affected.
