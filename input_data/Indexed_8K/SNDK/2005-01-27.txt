Total fourth quarter revenues increased 41% on a year-over-year basis to $549 million and increased 35% compared to the third quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter net income, which reflected a 37% tax rate, was $78 million compared to $88 million of net income in the fourth quarter of 2003, which reflected a 20% tax rate, and $54 million of net income in the third quarter of 2004. Fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.42 compared with $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $0.29 in the third quarter of 2004. Total revenue for fiscal 2004 was $1.8 billion, up 65% from $1.1 billion in 2003. Product revenues were $1.6 billion, up 63% from $1.0 billion in 2003. License and royalty revenues were $174 million, up 79% from $97 million in 2003. Net income was $267 million, up 58% from net income of $169 million in 2003. The provision for income tax was 37% for 2004 compared to 30% in 2003. Fully diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 were $1.44, compared to $1.02 in 2003. "SanDisk experienced outstanding results in our fourth quarter due to strong demand for our products in digital cameras, USB flash drives, mobile handsets and our new line of flash digital audio players," said SanDisk CEO Eli Harari. "In the fourth quarter we sold 110% more megabytes than in the prior quarter by successfully shifting consumer preference to our higher capacity cards. Higher yields on our 90-nanometer NAND/MLC, and higher unit volumes allowed us to aggressively reduce our costs and improve operating margins by almost 3% in the quarter despite a 34% sequential decline in the average price per megabyte." "In 2005 we will continue our focus on three areas. First, driving growth in our target consumer and handset markets, including the new storage opportunities in handsets, flash digital audio players, video games, second generation intelligent flash drives, and crypto-secure cards. Second, building our brand and expanding our global sales channels beyond 100,000 storefronts. Third, executing the transition of our captive volume production from 90-nanometer to 70-nanometer NAND/MLC, as well as ramping the new 300-millimeter flash fab, both currently scheduled to commence in the second half
of 2005. I am optimistic about the rapidly expanding and pervasive use of our storage technology and products in numerous emerging markets and applications over the next several years."
