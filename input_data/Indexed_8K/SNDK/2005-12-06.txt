ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
     On December 5, 2005, the United States International Trade Commission issued an order in Investigation No. 337-TA-526, entitled "Notice of Commission Decision to Review in Part an Initial Determination, and on Review, to Take No Position Concerning Certain Validity Issues and to Affirm the Administrative Law Judge's Determination that there is No Violation of Section 337; Termination of Investigation." The Commission order affirmed the prior October 19, 2005 finding by an Administrative Law Judge that certain STMicroelectronics NAND flash memory chips did not infringe three claims of SanDisk Corporation's United States Patent 5,172,338. The Commission order stated that the United States International Trade Commission did not take any position relating to the issues of anticipation and obviousness. The Commission order terminated the ITC case between SanDisk and STMicroelectronics. SanDisk intends to appeal the ITC order and finding of non-infringement.
