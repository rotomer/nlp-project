Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") had previously reported in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2004 that on September 10, 2004, SanDisk and Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba") created Flash Partners, Ltd., a Japanese yugen kaisha, owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba, and agreed to cooperate in the construction and equipping of a 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, Fab 3, in Yokkaichi, Japan to produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. The agreements governing the venture, including the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004, were filed with SanDisk's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2004.
The total investment in Fab 3, excluding the cost of building construction, was estimated at $2.5 billion through the end of 2006, of which SanDisk's share was estimated to be approximately $1.25 billion. This investment was expected to generate approximately 37,500 wafers per month (subsequently expanded to 48,750 wafers per month), of which SanDisk's allocation is 50%.
On February 14, 2006, SanDisk reported on its Current Report on Form 8-K that SanDisk and Toshiba had agreed on February 8, 2006 to accelerate the expansion of Fab 3 by increasing capacity from 48,750 wafers per month to 70,000 wafers per month by March 2007. The increase in wafer production was estimated to increase SanDisk's 50% investment in Fab 3 in the next 12 months by approximately $500 million, bringing SanDisk's total investment to approximately $1.6 billion.
On April 28, 2006, SanDisk and Toshiba agreed to further accelerate the expansion of Fab 3 to increase Fab 3 wafer capacity from 70,000 wafers per month to 90,000 wafers per month by April 2007. The incremental investment by SanDisk for 50% of this higher Fab 3 output is currently estimated at approximately $300 million over the next 12 months. SanDisk's total investment to bring Fab 3 wafer capacity to 90,000 wafers per month is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources.
