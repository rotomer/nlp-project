     (d) Not to take any action relating to the offering of the Securities and the Underlying Securities pursuant to this Agreement that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriter that the Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder.
     (e) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.

so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.

7. Covenants of the Underwriters
     . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any electronic roadshow or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
8. Indemnity and Contribution
 
necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any issuer free writing prospectus used by the Underwriters in violation of Section 7 hereof.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule III hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but if
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein (other than with respect to Section 8(a) in cases in which Section 8(b) is applicable), then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
pro rata
 
considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
9. Termination
     . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
10. Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities
 
that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Firm Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Firm Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Firm Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate number of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel)
 
reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
11. Entire Agreement
     (b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
     . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
12. Counterparts
     . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
13. Applicable Law
     . The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.

This provision, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Notes and the principal of any and all Notes that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and unpaid interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) and on such principal at the rate borne by the Notes during the period of such Default) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.06, and if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any and all Events of Defaults under this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on Notes that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.07, then and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Notes and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. The Company shall notify the Responsible Officer of the Trustee in writing, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default by delivering to the Trustee a statement specifying such Event of Default and any action the Company has taken, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
     In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
          Section 5.02.   . In the event that the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding hereunder have declared the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes, to be due and payable immediately in accordance with Section 5.01, and the Company shall have failed forthwith to pay such amounts, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, after being furnished suitable indemnity pursuant to Section 6.01, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid (including such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses or liabilities incurred by the Trustee hereunder other than through its negligence or bad faith), and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final degree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor on the Notes and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes wherever situated the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.
Payments of Notes on Default; Suit Therefor
 
     In case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes under title 11 of the United States Code, or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Company or such other obligor, the property of the Company or such other obligor, or in the case of any other judicial proceedings relative to the Company or such other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.02, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Notes, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such other actions as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Noteholders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on the Notes, its or their creditors, or its or their property, and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of any amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, custodian or similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Noteholders to make such payments to the Trustee, as administrative expenses, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements, including agents and counsel fees, and including any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.06 hereof, incurred by it up to the date of such distribution. To the extent that such payment of reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, monies, securities and other property which the holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Noteholder or the rights of any Noteholder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding.
     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes.
     In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee
 
shall be held to represent all the holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of the Notes parties to any such proceedings.
          Section 5.03.   . Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article V with respect to the Notes shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon presentation of the several Notes, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:
Application of Monies Collected by Trustee
     First, to the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.06;
     Second, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on the Notes in default in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto;
     Third, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, and be unpaid to the payment of the whole amount (including, if applicable, payments in respect of the Conversion Obligation and Additional Shares) then owing and unpaid upon the Notes for principal and interest, with interest on the overdue principal (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes, and in case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Notes, then to the payment of such principal and interest without preference or priority of principal over interest, or of interest over principal or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Note over any other Note, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and unpaid interest; and
     Fourth, to the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or any other Person lawfully entitled thereto.
          Section 5.04.   . No holder of any Note shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator, custodian or other similar official, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and no direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding pursuant to Section 5.07; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Note with every other taker and holder and the
Proceedings by Noteholders
 
Trustee, that no one or more Noteholders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Noteholder, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Noteholders (except as otherwise provided herein). For the protection and enforcement of this Section 5.04, each and every Noteholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and any provision of any Note, the right of any Noteholder to receive payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Noteholder.
     Anything in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, the holder of any Note, without the consent of either the Trustee or the holder of any other Note, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, may enforce, and may institute and maintain any proceeding suitable to enforce, his rights of conversion as provided herein.
          Section 5.05.   . In case of an Event of Default the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as are necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by taw.
Proceedings by Trustee
          Section 5.06.   . Except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article V to the Trustee or to the Noteholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.04, every power and remedy given by this Article V or by law to the Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Noteholders.
Remedies Cumulative and Continuing
          Section 5.07.   . The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to Notes; , , that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with
Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by Majority of Noteholders
provided
however
 
such direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the payment of and accrued and unpaid interest on, or the principal of, the Notes when due which has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.01, (ii) a failure by the Company to deliver cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) upon conversion of the Notes, or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provisions hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected thereby. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.07, said default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 5.08.   . The Trustee shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence and continuance of a Default of which a Responsible Officer has actual knowledge, mail to all Noteholders as the names and addresses of such holders appear upon the Note register, notice of all Defaults known to a Responsible Officer, unless such Defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice; and that, except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on any of the Notes, then in any such event the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Noteholders.
Notice of Defaults
provided
     Section 5.09.   . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Note by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; that the provisions of this Section 5.09 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04, or to any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on any Note on or after the due date expressed in such Note or to any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII.
Undertaking to Pay Costs
provided
 
        Section 6.01.   . The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiver of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs; that if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against loss, liability or expense.
Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee
provided
     No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that
     (a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred:
     (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture and, after it has been qualified thereunder, the Trust Indenture Act, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act against the Trustee; and
     (ii) in the absence of bad faith and willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
     (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be established by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
     (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and either (i) believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture or (ii) in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined as provided in Section 7.04 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
 
available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture;
     (d) whether or not therein provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section;
     (e) the Trustee shall not be liable in respect of any payment (as to the correctness of amount, entitlement to receive or any other matters relating to payment) or notice effected by the Company or any Paying Agent or any records maintained by any co-registrar with respect to the Notes;
     (f) if any party fails to deliver a notice relating to an event the fact of which, pursuant to this Indenture, requires notice to be sent to the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely on its failure to receive such notice as reason to act as if no such event occurred, unless such Responsible Officer of the Trustee had actual knowledge of such event;
     (g) in the absence of written investment direction from the Company, all cash received by the Trustee shall be placed in a non-interest bearing trust account. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for the selection of investments or for investment losses incurred thereon or for losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of any such investments prior to its stated maturity or the failure of the party directing such investments prior to its stated maturity or the failure of the party directing such investment to provide timely written investment direction, and the Trustee shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest any amounts held hereunder in the absence of such written investment direction from the Company; and
     (h) in the event that the Trustee is also acting as Custodian, Note Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or transfer agent hereunder, the rights and protections afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Article VI shall also be afforded to it in its capacity as such.
     None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.
          Section 6.02.   Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.01:
Reliance on Documents, Opinions, Etc.

     (b) any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company;
 
     (c) the Trustee may consult with counsel and require an Opinion of Counsel and any advice of such counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;
     (d) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Noteholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Noteholders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby;
     (e) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee from the Noteholders against such expenses or liability as a condition to so proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such examination shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand;
provided, however,
     (f) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents, custodians, nominees or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent, custodian, nominee or attorney appointed by it with due care hereunder, and
     (g) the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties.
     (h) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon Officer Certificates or Opinions of Counsel furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such Certificates or Opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein);
     (i) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officer' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign Officer' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
     In no event shall the Trustee be liable for any consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action other than through the Trustee's willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes, unless either (1) a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge of such default or Event of Default or (2) written notice of such default or Event of Default shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or by any holder of the Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture; and the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties.
          Section 6.03.   .

Officers' Certificate as Evidence
          Section 6.08.   .

If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
Eligibility of Trustee
          Section 6.10.  
Resignation or Removal of Trustee.

Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment sixty (60) days after the mailing of such notice of resignation to the Noteholders, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Noteholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.09, on behalf of

Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. Whenever the Company or the Trustee solicits the taking of any action by the holders of the Notes, the Company or the Trustee may fix, but shall not be required to, in advance of such solicitation, a date as the record date for determining Noteholders entitled to take such action. The record date if one is selected shall be not more than fifteen (15) days prior to the date of commencement of solicitation of such action.

Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners
 
account of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, for conversion of such Note and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Conversion Agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any holder for the time being, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for monies payable upon any such Note.

Notes so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this Section 7.04 if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right to vote such Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company, any other obligor on the Notes or a person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In the case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Notes, if any, known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above described persons; and, subject to Section 6.01, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Notes not listed therein are outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.

Conversion Privilege
     (a) Subject to the conditions described in clause (i), (ii), and (iii) below, and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article XIII, a Noteholder shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Note at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding February [___], 2013 at a rate (the "") of [___] shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment by the Company as provided in Section 13.04) per $1,000 principal amount Note (the "") under the circumstances and during the periods set forth below. On and after February [___], 2013, regardless of the conditions described in clause (i), (ii) and (iii) below, and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article XIII, a Noteholder shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Note at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date.
Conversion Rate
Conversion Obligation
     (i) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February [___], 2013, during the five Business Day period immediately after any five consecutive Trading Day period (the "") in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of such Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on such date and the Conversion Rate on such date, all as determined by the Trustee. The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes unless requested by the Company to do so in writing, and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a Noteholder provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price of the Notes would be less than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price at such time, at which time the Company shall instruct the Trustee to determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per Note is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date. If the Trading Price condition set forth above has been met, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders. If, at any time after the Trading Price condition set forth above has been met, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders.
Measurement Period
 
     (ii) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February [___], 2013, during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2006, if the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for twenty (20) or more Trading Days in a period of thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
     (iii) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February [___], 2013 as provided in Section 13.01(b), Section 13.01(c) and Section 13.01(d).
     (b) In the event that the Company elects to:
     (i) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at a price less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution; or
     (ii) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, assets or debt securities of the Company or rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value (as determined by the Board of Directors) exceeding 10% of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the day immediately preceding the date of declaration of such distribution,
then, in either case, holders may surrender the Notes for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company provides notice to holders referred to in the next sentence until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution or the date the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. The Company shall notify holders of any distribution referred to in either clause (i) or clause (ii) above and of the resulting conversion right no later than the 20 Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Holders may not exercise this right if such Holder participates in the distribution without conversion.
th
     (c) If the Company consolidates with or merges with or into another Person or is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, then the holders shall have the right to convert Notes at any time beginning fifteen calendar days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and until and including the date that is fifteen calendar days after the date that is the effective date of such transaction; such transaction does not otherwise constitute a Designated Event to which the provisions of Section 13.01(d) shall apply. The Company will notify holders of Notes at least 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated effective date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company and posted on its web site not later than two Business Day prior to such 15th day.
provided
 
     (d) If the Company is a party to any transaction or event that constitutes a Designated Event, a holder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the 30th scheduled Trading Day prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction or event until the related Designated Event Repurchase Date and, upon such surrender, if such Designated Event also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the holder shall be entitled to the increase in the Conversion Rate, if any, specified in Section 13.01(e); provided, however that no increase will be made in the case of Fundamental Change if at least 90% of the consideration paid of the Company's Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of shares of capital stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange or another U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ National Market or another established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States (or that will be so traded or quoted immediately following the transaction) and as a result of such transaction or transactions the notes become convertible solely into such common stock. The Company shall give notice in writing to all record Noteholders and the Trustee of the Designated Event no later than 30 scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Designated Event.
     (e) (i) If a Noteholder elects to convert Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change that occurs prior to May [___], 2013, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below. Settlement of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection shall be settled pursuant to Section 13.02(d) below. For purposes of this Section 13.01(e), a conversion shall be deemed to be "in connection" with a Fundamental Change to the extent that such conversion is effected during the time period specified in Section 13.01(d) (regardless of whether the provisions of clause (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b) or (c) of this Section 13.01 shall apply to such conversion).
Additional Shares
     (ii) The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the ""), and the Stock Price; that if the actual Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the next higher and next lower Stock Price amounts and the two nearest Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; further that if (1) the Stock Price is greater than $[] per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate, and (2) the Stock Price is less than $[] per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed [] per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04).

     (iii) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Notes is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.04 (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate by adding Additional Shares).
 
          Section 13.02.
Conversion Procedure.
     (a) Subject to Section 13.02(b), the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion in cash and shares of fully paid Common Stock, if applicable, by delivering, on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 20 Trading Days during the related Observation Period; that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to clause (k) below. The Daily Settlement Amounts shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period.
provided
     (b) Notwithstanding Section 13.02(a), the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.01(e) pursuant to this clause (b).
     (A) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is prior to the third Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the related Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.02(b) by delivering the cash and shares of Common Stock (based on the Conversion Rate, but without regard to the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.01(e)) on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will deliver the increase in such amount of cash and Reference Property in lieu of shares of Common Stock, if any, as if the Conversion Rate had been increased by such number of Additional Shares during the related Observation Period (and based upon the related Daily VWAP prices during such Observation Period). If such increased amount of cash and shares, if any, results in an increase to the amount of cash to be paid to holders, the Company will pay such increase in cash, and if such increased amount results in an increase to the number of shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such increase by delivering Reference Property based on such increased number of shares.
     (B) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is on or following the third scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.01(b) (based on the Conversion Rate as increased by the Additional Shares pursuant to Section 13.01(e) above) on the later to occur of (1) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and (2) the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
 
     (c) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (1) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i) and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and (2) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (A) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (B) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i), and (D) if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any. A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 13.02(c).
Notice of Conversion
Conversion Date
     No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be tendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also tendered a Designated Event Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.01 or 14.02, as the case may be.
     If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
     (d) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in Section 13.02(a), except to the extent specified in Section 13.02(b). The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed to the Conversion Agent or to the holder of the Note surrendered for conversion, or such holder's nominee or nominees, and by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to the Conversion Agent or to such holder, or such holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
     (e) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes.
     (f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision
 
thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
     (g) Except as provided in Section 13.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
     (h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
     (i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a record date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the record date will receive the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any r egular record date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on the Notes so converted; , that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Purchase Date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (ii) to the extent of any overdue interest existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Notes.
provided, however
     (j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided, however,
 
     (k) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
          Section 13.03.
[Intentionally Omitted].
          Section 13.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
     (a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combination into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 13.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
 
     (b) In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period expiring within sixty (60) calendar days after the issuance thereof) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or convertible securities are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
In determining whether any rights, warrants or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
     (c) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 13.04(a)), evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company (including securities, but excluding dividends and distributions covered by Section 13.04(b) or Section 13.04(d) and distributions described below in this paragraph (c) with respect to Spin-Offs) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, Indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 13.04(c) called the ""), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
where
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 4:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 13.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP above.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where
Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the ten Trading Days following any Spin-Off, references within this paragraph (c) to ten days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of trading days as have elapsed between such Spin-Off and the conversion date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
provided
     Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock, entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 13.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 13.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or
Trigger Event
 
other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
     For purposes of this Section 13.04(c), Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 13.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) applies or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) or Section 13.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 13.04(b) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 13.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Record Date" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to such event" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a).
     (d) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
provided
0
     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 13.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 13.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
     (e) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
 
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made if the application of the foregoing formulae would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 13.04 the term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
     (g) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 13.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 a notice of the increase at least fifteen days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     (h) All calculations and other determinations under this Article XIII shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section 13.04. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less
 
than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon a Fundamental Change, or upon maturity.
     (i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. The Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively rely on the accuracy of the Conversion Rate adjustment provided by the Company. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
     (j) In any case in which this Section 13.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 13.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 13.04(b), or (4) the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 13.04(e) (each an ""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Note converted after such Adjustment Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the amounts deliverable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 13.04. For purposes of this Section 13.04(j), the term "" shall mean:
Adjustment Determination Date
Adjustment Event
     (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
     (ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
     (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
     (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
 
     (k) For purposes of this Section 13.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
     (l) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder converts Notes prior to the effective date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the holder will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
          Section 13.05. . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
Shares to Be Fully Paid
          Section 13.06. .
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
     If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in either case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a "", then:
Merger Event
)
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.01(a) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article XIV herein.
     In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 13.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with
 
respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.02(a) and Section 13.02(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 13.01, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be changed to a right to convert such Note by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") such that from and after the effective time of such transaction, a Noteholder will be entitled thereafter to convert its Notes into cash (up to the aggregate principal amount thereof) and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 13.02(b). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII hereof prior to the effective date.
Reference Property
     (c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at his address appearing on the Note register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
          Section 13.07. .
Certain Covenants
     (a) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
     The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
     (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued
 
upon conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
     (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company will, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
          Section 13.08. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the contrary, the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Noteholder to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
Responsibility of Trustee
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 13.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 13.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
          Section 13.09. .
Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
     In case:
     (a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.04; or
     (b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants, or
     (c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from
 
par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
     (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Noteholder at his address appearing on the Note register, provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty days prior to the applicable date specified in clause (x) or (y) below, as the case may be, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
          Section 13.10. . Upon conversion of the Notes, the holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the associated rights issued under the Rights Plan or under any future shareholder rights plan the Company adopts unless, prior to conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with the Rights Plan. If, and only if, the holders receive rights under such shareholder rights plans as described in the preceding sentence upon conversion of their Notes, then no other adjustment pursuant to this Article XIII shall be made in connection with such shareholder rights plans.

EXHIBIT 5.1
SanDisk Corporation 140 Caspian Court Sunnyvale, California 94089
     Re:  
Registration of Securities of SanDisk Corporation
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          At your request, we have examined the Registration Statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form S-3 of SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of the following securities by the Company:
- shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), and the associated rights (the "Rights") to purchase shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, which are attached to all outstanding shares of Common Stock; and
- Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 (the "Debt Securities") which may be issued under an indenture (including any supplements thereto, an "Indenture") to be dated on or about the date of the first issuance of the Debt Securities, between the Company and a trustee to be selected by the Company, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement.
          The Common Stock and the Debt Securities are collectively referred to as the "Securities". The Securities are being registered for offering and sale from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act. The Registration Statement provides that the Securities may be offered in amounts, at prices and on terms to be set forth in one or more prospectus supplements to the Prospectus.
          Subject to certain proposed additional proceedings being taken as contemplated by the Registration Statement prior to the issuance and sale of the Securities being offered by the Company, we are of the opinion that:
1. With respect to the Common Stock offered under the Registration Statement, the Common Stock will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, upon payment for and delivery of the Common Stock as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Common Stock will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
2. With respect to any series of Debt Securities issued under an Indenture and offered under the Registration Statement, the Debt Securities will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, upon payment for and delivery of the Debt Securities in accordance with the Registration Statement will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally (including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws), and by general principles of equity including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
          We hereby consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to this firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Securities constituting part of the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
