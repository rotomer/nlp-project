Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
     As previously reported, on November 22, 2006, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") dated July 30, 2006 by and among SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("SanDisk"), Project Desert Ltd., an Israeli corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk ("Merger Sub") and msystems Ltd., an Israeli corporation ("msystems"), Merger Sub merged (the "Merger") with and into msystems, with msystems surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk.
     Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding ordinary share of msystems was exchanged for 0.76368 of a share of SanDisk common stock (the "Exchange Ratio"). SanDisk issued approximately 29 million shares of common stock to former msystems' shareholders. Based on the closing price of $47.14 per share of SanDisk's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on November 17, 2006, the last trading day before the closing of the Merger, the aggregate value of the consideration paid to former msystems' shareholders in connection with the Merger is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion.
