Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 19, 2007, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its second quarter ended July 1, 2007.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of product cost, gross margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and msystems Ltd. in November 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology that do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
SanDisk Corporation
601 McCarthy Boulevard
Milpitas, CA 95035-7932
Phone: 408-801-1000
Fax: 408-801-8657
Milpitas, CA, July 19, 2007  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the second quarter ended July 1, 2007. Second quarter revenue increased 15% on a year-over-year basis to $827 million and net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $96 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006.
Excluding the impact of acquisition-related charges, stock compensation expense and the related tax effect, second quarter non-GAAP net income was $72 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income of $118 million, or $0.58 per diluted share.
"Demand for our products in the retail channel recovered nicely in the second quarter, resulting in record megabyte sales. In particular, SanDisk's growing strength in Europe and other international markets doubled our international unit sales compared to last year," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "Product gross margins stabilized despite substantial price reductions in the second quarter. We expect product gross margins to improve gradually in the second half of the year, driven by more moderate price declines resulting from an expected improvement in the balance between demand and supply, declining manufacturing costs and strength in our income from royalties. The flurry of new Flash memory enabled, highly innovative consumer and mobile products coming from our customers, our competitors, and ourselves, we believe, will fuel strong demand for our products in the second half of 2007 and in 2008. Our strategic investments in leading edge technology and IP, captive low-cost manufacturing capacity, product innovation and global retail channels position us exceptionally well to profit in the expected industry growth cycle."
