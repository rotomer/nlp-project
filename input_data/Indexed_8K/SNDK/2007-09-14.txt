Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On August 31, 2007, SanDisk Corporation (the "Company") and 23 other companies were sued in the United States District Court of the Northern District of California in a purported consumer class action captioned Stuart Go et al. v. Lexar Media, Inc. et al., Civil Case No. 07-cv-04547-VRW, alleging a conspiracy to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize the pricing of flash memory, and concealment thereof, in violation of state and federal laws. The lawsuit purports to be on behalf of a class of purchasers of flash memory. The lawsuit seeks restitution, injunction and damages, including treble damages, in an unspecified amount.
     This week the Company and its Chief Executive Officer received grand jury subpoenas issued from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California indicating a Department of Justice investigation into possible antitrust violations in the NAND flash memory industry. The Company also received a notice from the Canadian Competition Bureau that the Bureau has commenced an industry-wide investigation with respect to alleged anti-competitive activity regarding the conduct of companies engaged in the supply of NAND flash memory chips to Canada and requesting that the Company preserve any records relevant to such investigation. The Company intends to cooperate in these investigations.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
