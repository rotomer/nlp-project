Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On October 18, 2007, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2007.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of product gross margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and msystems Ltd. in November 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation that do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology that do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
SanDisk Corporation 601 McCarthy Boulevard Milpitas, CA 95035-7932 Phone: 408-801-1000 Fax: 408-801-8657
Milpitas, CA, October 18, 2007  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007. Third quarter revenue increased 38% on a year-over-year basis to $1.037 billion and net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) increased to $85 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. GAAP net income was $103 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.
Excluding the impact of acquisition-related charges, stock compensation expense and the related tax effect, third quarter non-GAAP net income increased to $130 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $72 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $124 million, or $0.61 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006.
"We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Demand was exceptionally strong in international retail, following our strategy to aggressively expand our business outside of North America. In the mobile phone market we sold a record 42 million units, reinforcing the enormous global opportunity which is unfolding. USB revenues also contributed
 
significantly to our growth in the quarter," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "Gross margins and the pricing environment improved substantially and excellent execution at Fab 3 allowed us to respond to the surge in customer demand. We expect demand to remain strong through the fourth quarter holiday season although we may not be able to meet 100% of the demand."
