Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 28, 2008, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 30, 2007.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of product gross margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and msystems Ltd. in November 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Milpitas, CA, January 28, 2008  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2007. Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.246 billion increased 7% on a year-over-year basis and 20% on a sequential basis. Fourth-quarter net income, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $106 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $35 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006 that included a write-off of acquired in-process technology.
Total revenue for fiscal 2007 of $3.896 billion increased 20% from $3.258 billion in 2006. Net income for fiscal 2007 was $218 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to net income of $199 million, or $0.96 per diluted share that included write-offs of acquired in-process technology in fiscal 2006.
Excluding the impact of acquisition-related charges, share-based compensation expense and the related tax effect, fourth quarter non-GAAP net income increased to $162 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $130 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $192 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. On the same non-GAAP basis, total fiscal 2007 non-GAAP net income was $408 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, compared to $523 million, or $2.51 per diluted share in fiscal 2006.
"This was a good quarter for SanDisk considering the challenging business conditions in our markets. We continued to see strong growth in our mobile business where we sold a record 51 million units and our diversified and differentiated product portfolio delivered sequential growth in product gross margin," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "Despite current uncertainties in the worldwide economy and a challenging industry pricing environment in the first quarter, we expect to grow our top and bottom line in 2008, driven by continuing strength in our mobile markets, our expanding international retail footprint and our competitive cost structure."
