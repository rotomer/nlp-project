Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 13, 2008, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba") to collaborate on the development of certain types of rewriteable 3D memory (the "3D Collaboration"). Both the registrant and Toshiba will contribute and cross license technology related to the 3D Collaboration and will jointly perform research and development to further the 3D Collaboration.  As part of the licensing of its intellectual property, the Registrant will receive certain licensing payments from Toshiba.
The Registrant and Toshiba currently collaborate in the development and manufacture of NAND-flash memory products using equipment owned or leased by three joint ventures in each of which the Registrant owns a 49.9% interest and Toshiba owns a 50.1% interest.
