On August 4, 2009, the Board of Directors of SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) appointed Kevin DeNuccio and Chenming Hu to its Board of Directors (the Board).
There are no relationships or related transactions between the Registrant and each of Mr. DeNuccio and Dr. Hu that would be required to be reported under Section 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  In connection with the appointment of Mr. DeNuccio and Dr. Hu to the Board, they will be compensated in accordance with the Registrants compensation arrangements for its non-employee Board members. The Registrant entered into indemnification agreements with each of Mr. DeNuccio and Dr. Hu, the terms of which are identical in all material respects to the form of indemnification agreement that the Registrant has previously entered into with each of its directors and the form of which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Registrants Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 33-96298).
 
On August 4, 2009, the Board approved an amendment to Article III, Section 1 of the Registrants Amended and Restated Bylaws to increase the size of the Board from eight to nine members. A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Registrant is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The registered office shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.
Section 1.
 
The corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require.
Section 2.
 
 
 
 
  All meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors shall be held at such place either within or without the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. Meetings of stockholders for any other purpose may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.
Section 1.
 
  Annual meetings of stockholders, commencing with the year 1996, shall be held at such place, date and hour as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors (the Board) and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which the stockholders shall elect a board of directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held at such place, date and hour as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors (the Board) and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which the stockholders shall elect a board of directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
Section 2.
 
  Written notice of the annual meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.
Section 3.
 
 
 
 
 
  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, or cause a third party to prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
Section 4.
 
  Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the certificate of incorporation, may be called by the chief executive officer or the chairman and shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning at least a majority of the entire capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.
Section 5.
 
  Written notice of a special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
Section 6.
 
  Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.
Section 7.
 
  The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 8.
 
  When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or of the certificate of incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
Section 9.
 
  Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholders name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholders attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
Section 10.
 
  Except as provided in Section 2 of Article III of these bylaws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that directors election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided that if, at the close of the notice period set forth in Section 14 of this Article II, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  For purposes of this Section 11, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director.
Section 11.
 
 
 
 
  Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Section 12.
 
  At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting, business must be:
Section 13.
 
(a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors;
 
(b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of a majority of the total number of directors which the corporation would have if there were no vacancies (the Whole Board); or
 
(c) otherwise properly be requested to be brought before any meeting by a stockholder.
 
For business to be properly requested to be brought before any meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than eighty (80) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the meeting is not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders. A stockholders notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:
 
(a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting;
 
(b) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such business;
 
(c) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote on such business on the date of such notice and, if applicable, intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to introduce the business specified in the notice;
 
(d) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder;
 
(e) such other information regarding each matter of business to be proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, by the Board of Directors; and
 
(f) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 of the bylaws. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13 of the bylaws, and if he/she should so determine, he/she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13.
 
 
 
 
  Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally.  However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholders intent to make such nomination or nominations has been received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 80 days in advance of such meeting; provided however, that in the event that the date of the meeting was not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than 90 days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders. Each such notice shall set forth:
Section 14.
 
(a) The name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated;
 
(b) A representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice;
 
(c) A description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder;
 
(d) Such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and
 
(e) The consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if so elected.
 
 
 
 
  The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board shall be nine (9). Each director shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, and shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
Section 1.
 
  Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except that in the event a director is removed by the stockholders for cause, the stockholders shall be entitled to fill the vacancy created as a result of such removal. The directors so chosen shall serve for the remainder of the term of the vacated directorships being filled and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.
Section 2.
 
  The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.
 
 
 
  The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.
Section 4.
 
 
 
 
  The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected Board of Directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
Section 5.
 
  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.
Section 6.
 
  Special meetings of the board may be called by the chief executive officer, chairman or vice-chairman on five (5) days notice to each director by mail or twenty-four (24) hours notice to each director either personally or by telephone, telegram or facsimile; special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two directors unless the board consists of only one director, in which case special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of the sole director. A written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time of the meeting stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Section 7.
 
  At all meetings of the board a majority of the then existing directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
Section 8.
 
  Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the chairman of the board, if any, or in his or her absence by the vice-chairman, or if there is no vice-chairman, by the chief executive officer, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting.
Section 9.
 
  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
Section 10.
 
  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
Section 11.
 
 
 
  The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.
Section 12.
 
In the absence of disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he/she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
 
 
 
 
Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the certificate of incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporations property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the resolution or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
 
  Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required.
Section 13.
 
 
 
  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. Director compensation may include, among other things, payment of their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, payment of a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or payment of a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
Section 14.
 
 
 
  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or bylaw, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Section 15.
 
 
 
 
  Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the certificate of incorporation or of these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any director or stockholder, such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such director or stockholder, at his or her address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. Notice to directors may also be given personally or by telephone or telegram.
Section 1.
 
   Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the certificate of incorporation or of these bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
Section 2.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The Board of Directors shall designate certain officers of the corporation as executive officers of the corporation, and such executive officers shall include the president, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and such other officers as the Board of Directors may designate and may include the chairman or vice-chairman.
Section 1.
 
The Board of Directors may also create other offices of the corporation that are not designated as executive offices and such non-executive offices may include one or more vice-presidents, a secretary, assistant secretaries, a treasurer, a controller and other assistants to the chief financial officer.

Section 3.
 
  With respect to the non-executive offices established by the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or, if so delegated to the chief executive officer, the chief executive officer, may appoint such other non-executive officers, who shall hold their offices for such terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors or by the chief executive officer.
Section 4.
 
  The compensation of all the executive officers of the corporation shall be fixed by the Board of Directors, and the salaries of all the non-executive officers of the corporation shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or, if so delegated by the Board, by the chief executive officer.

Any non-executive officer appointed by the chief executive officer may be removed at any time by such person. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation appointed by the Board of Directors shall be filled by the Board of Directors, and any vacancy occurring in any non-executive office of the corporation appointed by the chief executive officer shall be filled by the Board of Directors or by the chief executive officer.
Section 6.
 
 
 
  The chairman of the board, if any, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of the stockholders at which he/she shall be present. He/she shall have and may exercise such powers as are, from time to time, assigned to him/her by the Board and as may be provided by law.

He/she shall have and may exercise such powers as are, from time to time, assigned to him/her by the board and as may be provided by law.
Section 8.
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The president, unless the board has appointed a separate chief executive officer, shall be the chief executive officer of the corporation.

If the corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualification, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights for certificated shares shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, provided that, except as otherwise provided in section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
