Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 28, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2010.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, the impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Milpitas, CA, January 28, 2010 - SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the global leader in flash memory cards, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2010.  Total fourth quarter revenue of $1.24 billion increased 44% on a year-over-year basis and increased 33% sequentially.  Total revenue for fiscal 2009 of $3.57 billion increased 6% from $3.35 billion in fiscal 2008.
 
Fourth quarter net income, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), was $340 million, or earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, compared to net loss of ($1.76) billion, or ($7.78) per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and net income of $231 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  The GAAP net income for fiscal 2009 was $415 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, compared to net loss of ($1.99) billion, or ($8.82) per share, in fiscal 2008.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related charges, share-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the cash-settled convertible note, and related tax adjustments and valuation allowance, fourth-quarter net income was $277 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($359) million, or ($1.59) per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and net income of $176 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  The non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2009 was $427 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to net loss of ($466) million, or ($2.07) per share, in fiscal 2008.  For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables and footnotes.
We delivered a terrific fourth quarter in 2009  our best performance ever in product revenue, profit and cash flow.  These results demonstrate the success of the actions that we took this past year, including restructuring our captive supply and diversifying our OEM and retail channels that resulted in unit sales growth of 55% and gigabyte growth of 100% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.  Product gross margin was sharply higher due to continued strong cost reductions and stable pricing, said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO, SanDisk. In 2010, we look forward to solid growth in our markets with a continued emphasis on profitability.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about our business prospects and outlook, our expectations for fiscal year 2010 and our expectations regarding our business, including our retail and OEM businesses, and continued cost reductions, that are based on our current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others:
competitive pricing pressures, resulting in lower average selling prices and lower or negative product gross margins;
expansion of supply from existing competitors and ourselves creating excess market supply, causing our average selling prices to decline faster than our costs;
unpredictable or changing demand for our products, particularly for certain form factors or capacities;
excess captive memory output or capacity which could result in write-downs for excess inventory, lower of cost or market reserves, fixed costs associated with under-utilized capacity, or other consequences;
inability to maintain or grow sales through our new channels to which we are selling private label products, wafers and components or potential loss of branded product sales as a result;
insufficient non-memory materials or capacity from our suppliers and contract manufacturers to meet demand; or increases in cost of non-memory materials or capacity;
less than anticipated demand, including due to economic weakness in our markets; and
other risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 27, 2009.

(1) To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Company.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses we recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, the impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with our cash-settled convertible debt, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.

(a) Share-based compensation expense. The fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2009 include a one-time cumulative adjustment of $16.2 million to increase share-based compensation due to the way in which the Company's third-party software application incorrectly accounted for estimated forfeitures in share-based compensation calculations. This cumulative adjustment relates to the nine months ended September 27, 2009 and the three years ended December 28, 2008, and is not material for any prior period.
