On November 17, 2011, Yoram Cedar announced that he will step down on December 31, 2011 (the "Separation Date") from his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of SanDisk Corporation (the "Company"). In connection with Mr. Cedar's expected departure, the Company entered into a separation agreement (the "Separation Agreement") with Mr. Cedar, which will become effective on November 17, 2011 (the "Effective Date"), provided that Mr. Cedar does not revoke the Separation Agreement.
The Separation Agreement provides that within ten days following the Separation Date, the Company will pay Mr. Cedar a lump sum payment of $485,000, which is equivalent to one year of his most recent base salary, and that Mr. Cedar will receive a payment of $436,500 when bonuses are paid under the 2011 bonus plan, or no later than March 15, 2012. The Separation Agreement also specifies that the Company will provide Mr. Cedar up to 18 months of medical coverage. In addition, as of the Separation Date, Mr. Cedar will receive accelerated vesting of his unvested stock options and restricted stock units that would have vested on or within 15 months of the Separation Date. Among other things, the Separation Agreement also provides for a general release by Mr. Cedar in favor of the Company, and Mr. Cedar's agreement to certain confidentiality, cooperation, non-solicitation and non-disclosure obligations.
