The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than nominations if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholders proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.
(A)(4)    Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13 and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 13 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10
th
) day following the day on which such public announcement regarding an increase in the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual
meeting is first made by the corporation.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies or votes in support of such stockholders nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholders representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(vi) of this Section 13), and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 13, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this Section 13, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or a reliable reproduction of the writing at the meeting of stockholders.

Nothing in this Section 13 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporations proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation.
