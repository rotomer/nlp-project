Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 19, 2012, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its first quarter ended April 1, 2012.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011 and FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants convertible debt and related tax adjustments, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with convertible debt and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
  
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

SANDISK ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
Milpitas, CA, April 19, 2012 - SanDisk
Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), a global leader in flash memory storage solutions, announced today results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2012. Total first quarter revenue of $1.21 billion declined 7% on a year-over-year basis and declined 24% on a sequential basis.
On a GAAP
(1)
basis, first quarter net income was $114 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to net income of $224 million, or $0.92, per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and $281 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
On a non-GAAP
(2)
basis, first quarter net income was $156 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to net income of $251 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and net income of $317 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables and footnotes.
Our first quarter results were adversely impacted by lower-than-expected pricing and demand weakness in certain segments and we expect similar trends in the second quarter as well, said Sanjay Mehrotra, president and chief executive officer. We believe a seasonally stronger demand environment in the second half of the year, combined with our diversifying portfolio of mobile and SSD solutions, will allow us to deliver strong sequential revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters.
