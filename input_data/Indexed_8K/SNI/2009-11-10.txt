Claimant
Indemnifying Party
 
provision of this Agreement under which such claim is made. If the claim relates to an Action filed by a third party against the Claimant, such notice shall be given by the Claimant to the Indemnifying Party within thirty (30) days after written notice of such Action was given to the Claimant and shall include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers), if any, served on or received by Claimant from such third party; , , that failure of the Claimant to give the Indemnifying Party notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice actually prejudices any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party.
provided
however
(b) Following receipt of notice from the Claimant of a claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days to make such investigation of the claim as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or desirable. For the purposes of such investigation, the Claimant agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party and/or its authorized Representative(s) the information relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate the claim and all other information in Claimant's possession or under Claimant's control that the Indemnifying Party reasonably requests. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of such 30-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Claimant the full amount of the claim subject to the terms, limitations and procedures set forth herein. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party do not agree within such 30-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the Claimant may seek appropriate legal remedies.
(c) With respect to any claim by a third party as to which the Claimant is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in or assume control of the defense of such claim, subject to the Indemnifying Party's (i) notifying the Claimant in writing promptly after receipt of the Claimant's notice of claim of its intention to assume such defense or opposition; (ii) retaining counsel reasonably acceptable to the Claimant; and (iii) conducting diligently such defense or opposition at all times. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy all of the conditions contained in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence, then the Claimant may undertake the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of such claim with counsel selected by the Claimant at the Indemnifying Party's cost and expense, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the defense of any third party claim pursuant to this , then the Claimant shall have the right to participate in the defense of such claim at the Claimant's own cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the control of the defense of any third party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall nonetheless have the right to participate in the defense of such claim at its own expense and shall cooperate with the Claimant in such defense.
Section 7.3(c)
(d) None of the Gulliver Media Indemnified Parties, the Company Indemnified Parties or the Cox TMI Indemnified Parties may settle or compromise any claim by any third party or consent to the entry of any judgment in favor of any third party with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of any Indemnifying Party from whom such indemnification is being sought unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnifying Party from all Liability to such third party arising out of such claim and does not contain any equitable order,
 
judgment or term in favor of such third party which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of such Indemnifying Party or any of such Indemnifying Party's Affiliates. No Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise any claim by any third party or consent to the entry of any judgment in favor of any third party with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of any Claimant as to which the Claimant is entitled to indemnification hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Claimant from all Liability to such third party arising out of such claim and does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term in favor of such third party which in any manner adversely affects, restrains or interferes with the business of such Claimant or any of such Claimant's Affiliates.
(e) If a claim, whether between the parties or by a third party, requires immediate action, the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to reach a decision with respect thereto as expeditiously as possible.

PRESS RELEASE
For immediate release
Nov. 5, 2009
CINCINNATI  Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (NYSE: SNI), owner and operator of the Food Network and HGTV lifestyle television networks, will enter into a joint venture with Cox Communications Inc. by which it will acquire a controlling interest in the Travel Channel.
The two companies today signed a definitive agreement that, upon completion, will result in Scripps Networks Interactive owning 65 percent of the Travel Channel and Cox Communications retaining a 35 percent minority stake in the network.
The Travel Channel transaction is expected to be completed by or before January 2010.
"Combining the Travel Channel with Food Network and HGTV will make our fast-growing, young company the undisputed global leader in lifestyle programming," said Kenneth W. Lowe, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Scripps Networks Interactive. "This collection of popular lifestyle networks will be in great demand worldwide and promises to create substantial long-term value for all of our stakeholders."
Launched in 1987, Travel Channel has grown to become one of America's best known cable television networks and today reaches about 95 million U.S. television households. The television network  the cornerstone of Travel Channel Media  supports a growing range of cross-platform initiatives including Internet, mobile and social media applications.
"Adding the Travel Channel, and its related enterprises, provides us with a unique opportunity to meaningfully expand our portfolio into a lifestyle category that's highly desirable to media consumers, advertisers and programming distributors," Lowe said. "Our vision for Travel follows the same script that's made Food Network and HGTV two of the most powerful brands in all of television. By lending our unparalleled expertise in developing successful lifestyle media businesses, we have every confidence that we can build on Travel's strong brand identity and leverage the successes achieved to date by the top-notch team at Travel Channel and our new partners at Cox Communications."
As proposed, the transaction is structured as a leveraged joint venture between Scripps Networks Interactive and Cox Communications.
Cox will contribute the Travel Channel, valued at $975 million, and Scripps Networks Interactive will contribute $181 million in cash to a newly created partnership. The partnership, in turn, will take on $878 million in third-party debt that will be guaranteed by Scripps and indemnified by Cox, with the proceeds to be distributed to Cox.
The transaction will result in the partnership having about $696 million in net debt.
"This solid partnership that we're establishing today allows us to maintain an interest in Travel Channel while at the same time giving the network an opportunity to leverage the resources and expertise of a successful programmer like Scripps Networks Interactive," said Cox Communications President Patrick Esser. "Scripps has an outstanding reputation as a company, an employer and a programmer. Over the past 15 years, Scripps Networks Interactive has built a portfolio of leading lifestyle programming brands, and we think this complementary expertise will be a boon to Travel Channel's future growth."
Scripps Networks Interactive will control the joint venture and the network will be run as part of the company's growing portfolio of popular lifestyle media brands.
"The incredibly complementary nature of our lifestyle media businesses presents an abundance of opportunity to provide services for Travel Channel that will result in increased advertising and affiliate revenues and substantial cost synergies," Lowe said. "We have extensive experience working with partners to build value over the long term. Among cable companies, Cox has an outstanding reputation for its vision and investment for the long-term success of its businesses. We look forward to partnering with them in this venture."
Scripps Networks Interactive was advised on the transaction by Barclays Capital Inc. and Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom LLP.
