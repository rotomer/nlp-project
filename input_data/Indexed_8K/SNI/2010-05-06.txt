PRESS RELEASE
May 6, 2010
For immediate release
CINCINNATI  Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (NYSE: SNI) today reported operating results for the first quarter 2010.
Results for the three-month period ended March 31 reflect strong, double-digit growth in advertising and affiliate fee revenue at the company's Lifestyle Media business segment, which includes HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel.
Consolidated revenue for the quarter increased 32 percent to $469 million from the prior-year period. Excluding Travel Channel, which was acquired Dec. 15, 2009, the company's consolidated revenue increased 16 percent to $411 million year-over-year.
Total revenue from the company's Lifestyle Media business segment was $429 million, up 38 percent from the first-quarter 2009. Excluding Travel Channel, Lifestyle Media total revenue was $371 million, up 20 percent year-over-year.
Consolidated expenses for the quarter increased 36 percent from the prior-year period to $294 million. The increase in expenses included:
 
 
Excluding these items and a one-time, spin-off related item in the prior-year period, consolidated expenses were up 26 percent year-over-year. The increase in expenses is attributable to the addition of the Travel Channel and the restoration of marketing budgets to support brand-building initiatives at all of the company's television networks. The company had significantly held back marketing expenses in 2009 in response to the economic recession and its anticipated negative effect on advertising sales.
First-quarter net income attributable to Scripps Networks Interactive was $72.5 million, or 43 cents per share, compared with $60.1 million, or 37 cents per share, in the first-quarter 2009. Excluding one-time expense items, first-quarter 2010 earnings per share would have been 50 cents.
 
Total segment profit for the company was up 26 percent to $175 million in the first quarter compared with $139 million in the prior-year period. (See Note 2 for a definition of segment profit). Excluding one-time expense items, total segment profit was $202 million compared with $143 million in the prior-year quarter.
"Scripps Networks Interactive had an exceptionally good first quarter thanks to the healthier advertising marketplace, solid audience growth at our three flagship television networks and a strong, double-digit increase in affiliate revenues," said Kenneth W. Lowe, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Scripps Networks Interactive. "The ever-rising popularity of HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel contributed significantly to our solid financial results for the first three months of the year."
"We're also making good progress executing our strategic plan for 2010, which includes fully integrating Travel Channel, the debut of the new Cooking Channel during Memorial Day weekend and exporting our powerful brands across the globe," Lowe said. "Based on what we're experiencing in the early going, 2010 is shaping up very positively for the company and its shareholders."
Here are first-quarter results by operating segment:

Excluding one-time expense items, non programming costs increased 37 percent.

1. OTHER CHARGES AND CREDITS
Operating results in the first quarter of 2010 include $15.5 million of costs incurred related to the Travel Channel integration. Operating results in 2010 also include $11.0 million of marketing and legal expenses incurred to support the company's affiliate agreement renewal negotiations for Food Network and HGTV. These items reduced net income attributable to SNI $12.1 million, $.07 per share.
2. SEGMENT INFORMATION
We determine our business segments based upon our management and internal reporting structure. Our reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer different products and services.
Lifestyle Media includes our national television networks, HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, DIY Network, FLN (to be rebranded as the Cooking Channel), and Great American Country ("GAC"). Lifestyle Media also includes Web sites that are associated with the aforementioned television brands and other Internet-based businesses serving food, home, and travel related categories such as HGTVPro.com and FrontDoor.com. We own approximately 69% of Food Network and 65% of Travel Channel. Each of our networks is distributed by cable, satellite distributors, and telecommunications.
Interactive Services includes our online comparison shopping service, Shopzilla, and its related online comparison shopping brands, BizRate and Beso. Our product comparison shopping services help consumers find products offered for sale on the Web by online retailers. Shopzilla also operates a Web-based consumer feedback network within the BizRate brand that collects millions of consumer reviews of stores and products each year.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating performance of our business segments using a measure we call segment profit. Segment profit excludes interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, divested operating units, restructuring activities, investment results and certain other items that are included in net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Refer to Note 5for reconciliations to GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures,
Items excluded from segment profit generally result from decisions made in prior periods or from decisions made by corporate executives rather than the managers of the business segments. Depreciation and amortization charges are the result of decisions made in prior periods regarding the allocation of resources and are therefore excluded from the measure. Financing, tax structure and divestiture decisions are generally made by corporate executives. Excluding these items from our business segment performance measure enables us to evaluate business segment operating performance for the current period based upon current economic conditions and decisions made by the managers of those business segments in the current period.
Information regarding the operating performance of our business segments and a reconciliation to our results of operations is as follows:
 
Corporate includes the operating results of the venture we formed with Chello Zone Media in the fourth quarter of 2009, operating results from the international licensing of our national networks' programming, and the costs associated with our international expansion initiatives. The venture with Chello Zone Media, of which we own 80%, was formed to launch new lifestyle-oriented channels in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Our continued investment in the Company's international expansion initiatives increased the first quarter 2010 segment loss at corporate by $1.8 million.
3. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Our Lifestyle Media division earns revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time on our national television networks, affiliate fees paid by cable and satellite television operators that carry our network programming, the licensing of its content to third parties, the licensing of its brands for consumer products such as books and kitchenware, and from the sale of advertising on our Lifestyle Media affiliated Web sites.
Supplemental information for Lifestyle Media is as follows:
 
 
4. TRAVEL CHANNEL
On December 15, 2009 we acquired a 65 percent controlling interest in the Travel Channel.
The following table summarizes Travel Channel's quarterly financial information for 2009.
 
Prior to December 15, 2009, the Travel Channel was owned and operated by Cox Communications Inc. ("Cox"). The summarized results above reflect the historical combined results of operations for the Travel Channel and were prepared on a basis of accounting that was in accordance with GAAP, but the amounts are not necessarily indicative of Travel Channel's actual results had they been operating as a separate, stand-alone company for the periods presented. The amounts summarized above include allocations for certain corporate overhead expenses that were based on Cox management's best estimate of amounts attributable to the Travel Channel. Additionally, the Travel Channel had a number of service agreements with a third party covering affiliate sales, advertising sales and transmission and quality control/library services. The costs of these services are included in the quarterly results summarized above. Following the integration of the Travel Channel into SNI, these services will be provided by SNI and the costs allocated to Travel for such services could differ from the amounts included in the historical results above.
The fourth quarter 2009 amounts include both the periods prior to and subsequent to our acquisition of the Travel Channel.
5. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with GAAP provided in this release, the Company has presented segment profit. A reconciliation of segment profit to operating income determined in accordance with GAAP for each business segment is as follows:
 
The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less dividends paid to noncontrolling interests and acquisitions of property, plant and equipment. The Company measures free cash flow as it believes it is an important indicator for management and investors as to the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments and return capital to shareholders. A reconciliation of free cash flow is as follows:
 
Since segment profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures, they should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
