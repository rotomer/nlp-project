For immediate release
Aug. 9, 2011
KNOXVILLE, Tenn.  Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (NYSE: SNI) today reported operating results for the second quarter 2011.
Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 12 percent to $534 million from the prior-year period. Results for the three-month period ended June 30 reflect strong advertising revenue of $374 million, up 13 percent, and affiliate fee revenue of $148 million, up 6.3 percent year-over-year.
Expenses for the quarter increased 1.2 percent from the prior-year period to $260 million. Expenses in the second quarter 2010 included $8.6 million in one-time expenses related to the Travel Channel transition. Excluding the prior-year transition costs, consolidated expenses increased 4.7 percent in the second quarter of 2011. The increase was driven primarily by increased marketing expenses to promote programming initiatives and higher personnel costs.
Total segment profit increased 24 percent to $274 million. Excluding the 2010 one-time item noted above, segment profit increased 19 percent from the second quarter of 2010. (See for a definition of segment profit).

On May 31, the company completed the sale of its Shopzilla online comparison shopping business. The results from this business segment have been classified as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter 2011 was $55.5 million which included a loss on divestiture of $53.3 million. Including losses from discontinued operations, net income attributable to Scripps Networks Interactive was $77.4 million or $0.46 per share compared with $106 million or $0.63 per share. Results for the second quarter 2010 include income from discontinued operations of $8.2 million.
"The outstanding marketing power of Scripps Networks Interactive's television and Internet brands is evident in the company's solid second quarter financial results," said Kenneth W. Lowe, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel  our fully distributed networks  consistently lead their respective content categories and genres on both TV and the Web, aggregating large and targeted audiences that are highly valued by media consumers, our advertising customers and distribution partners."
"Likewise our premium-tier channels in the home and food categories, DIY Network and Cooking Channel, generated strong revenue growth as an increasing number of viewers discovered the exceptional vitality and utility of the creative original programming that's defining these unique and exciting brands. Put it all together, and the company succeeded in delivering solid double-digit growth in revenue and segment profit during the second quarter and is on track for another outstanding year."

1. OTHER CHARGES AND CREDITS
During 2010, we completed the rebranding of the Fine Living Network ("FLN") to the Cooking Channel and subsequently contributed the membership interest of the Cooking Channel to the Food Network Partnership (the "Partnership") in August of 2010. In accordance with the terms of the Partnership agreement, the noncontrolling interest owner was required to make a pro-rata capital contribution to maintain its proportionate interest in the Partnership. At the close of our 2010 fiscal year, the noncontrolling owner had not made the required $52.8 million contribution and as a result its ownership interest in the Partnership was diluted from 31 percent to 25 percent. Accordingly, for the four months following the Cooking Channel contribution, profits were allocated to the noncontrolling owner at its reduced ownership percentage, reducing net income attributed to noncontrolling interest by $8.0 million in 2010.
Food Network Partnership noncontrolling interest 
In February 2011, the noncontrolling owner made the $52.8 million pro-rata contribution to the Partnership and its ownership interest was returned to the pre-dilution percentage as if this pro-rata contribution had been made as of the date of the Cooking Channel contribution. The retroactive impact from restoring the noncontrolling owner's interest in the Partnership increased net income attributed to noncontrolling interest $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2011. Year-to-date net income attributable to SNI was decreased $4.7 million, $.03 per share.
Operating results in the second quarter of 2010 include $8.6 million of transition costs following our acquisition of a controlling interest in the Travel Channel in December of 2009. Net income attributable to SNI for the second quarter of 2010 was reduced $3.4 million, $.02 per share.
Travel Channel and other costs 
For the year-to-date period of 2010, these Travel Channel transition costs were $24.1 million. Year-to-date operating results in 2010 also include $11.0 million of marketing and legal expenses incurred to support the company's affiliate agreement renewal negotiations for Food Network and HGTV. These items reduced year-to-date net income attributable to SNI $15.5 million, $.09 per share.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During the second quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors approved the sale of our Shopzilla business and its related online comparison shopping brands. We received consideration totaling approximately $160 million upon finalizing the sale of the business on May 31, 2011. The Shopzilla business' assets, liabilities and results of operations have been retrospectively presented as discontinued operations within our condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods.
 
Discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2011 reflect a loss on divestiture of $53.3 million related to the sale of the Shopzilla business. No income tax benefit related to the capital losses attributed to the sale has been recognized. Net income attributable to SNI was decreased $.31 per share. The loss on divestiture is subject to the settlement of final working capital adjustments and $5 million in contingent cash consideration if Shopzilla achieves certain performance targets in 2012.
The income tax benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2010 includes a reduction in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset resulting from the sale of our uSwitch business in December of 2009. The reduction in the valuation allowance is attributed to the partial utilization of the uSwitch capital loss against capital gains that were generated in periods prior to the Company's separation from The E. W. Scripps Company ("E. W. Scripps"). In accordance with the tax allocation agreement with E. W. Scripps, we were notified in the second quarter of 2010 that these capital gains were available for use by SNI. The income tax benefit increased income from discontinued operations $9.3 million. Net income attributable to SNI was increased $.06 per share.
3. SEGMENT INFORMATION
We determine our business segments based upon our management and internal reporting structure. Our reportable segment, Lifestyle Media, is a strategic business that offers different products and services.
Lifestyle Media includes our national television networks, HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel and Great American Country ("GAC"). Lifestyle Media also includes Web sites that are associated with the aforementioned television brands and other Internet-based businesses serving food, home and travel related categories. The Food Network and Cooking Channel are included in the Food Network Partnership of which we own approximately 69%. We also own 65% of Travel Channel. Each of our networks is distributed by cable and satellite distributors and telecommunication service providers.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating performance of our business segments and makes decisions about the allocation of resources to our business segments using a measure we call segment profit. Segment profit excludes interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, divested operating units, restructuring activities, investment results and certain other items that are included in net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Refer to Note 5for reconciliations to GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures,
Items excluded from segment profit generally result from decisions made in prior periods or from decisions made by corporate executives rather than the managers of the business segments. Depreciation and amortization charges are the result of decisions made in prior periods regarding the allocation of resources and are therefore excluded from the measure. Financing, tax structure and divestiture decisions are generally made by corporate executives. Excluding these items from our business segment performance measure enables us to evaluate business segment operating performance for the current period based upon current economic conditions and decisions made by the managers of those business segments in the current period.
Information regarding the operating performance of our business segments and a reconciliation to our results of operations is as follows:
 
Corporate includes the results of the lifestyle-oriented channels we operate in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, operating results from the international licensing of our national networks' programming, and the costs associated with our international expansion initiatives.
Our continued investment in international expansion initiatives increased the segment loss at corporate by $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $2.2 million for the year-to-date period of 2011 compared with $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $5.0 million for the year-to-date period of 2010.
4. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Our Lifestyle Media division earns revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time on our national television networks, affiliate fees paid by cable and satellite television operators that carry our network programming, the licensing of its content to third parties, the licensing of its brands for consumer products such as books and kitchenware, and from the sale of advertising on our Lifestyle Media affiliated Web sites.
Supplemental information for Lifestyle Media is as follows:
 
 
5. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with GAAP provided in this release, the Company has presented segment profit. A reconciliation of segment profit to operating income determined in accordance with GAAP for each business segment is as follows:
 
The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less dividends paid to noncontrolling interests and acquisitions of property and equipment. The Company measures free cash flow as it believes it is an important indicator for management and investors as to the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments and return capital to shareholders. A reconciliation of free cash flow is as follows:
 
Since segment profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures, they should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
