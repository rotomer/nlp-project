On August 16, 2011, Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (the "Company") entered into new employment agreements with Mr. Anatolio B. Cruz, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary, and Mr. Mark S. Hale, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Technology Officer.
Term
The employment agreement with Mr. Cruz continues until December 31, 2012 and the employment agreement with Mr. Hale continues until December 31, 2014.
Compensation Levels
The employment agreements set forth the existing compensation and benefit levels for each executive. For example, during the term:
 
 
 
Severance
Upon a termination of each executive's employment without "cause", for "good reason", death, or disability, he would be entitled to a pro-rated annual incentive based on actual performance for the year of termination. In addition, Mr. Cruz would receive a severance payment equal to 2 times base salary and target annual incentive and medical, dental and life insurance coverage for 24 months. Mr. Hale would receive a severance payment equal to 1.5 times base salary and target annual incentive and medical, dental and life insurance coverage for 18 months.
Change in Control
Each executive will participate in the Executive Change in Control Plan, which provides certain severance benefits in the event the executive's employment terminates without "cause" or for "good reason" within 2 years after a change in control of the Company. The employment agreements provide that if the executive is vested under the pension plan at the time of a change in control, then he will be treated as if he had attained at least age 55 with 10 years of service on the date of termination for purposes of calculating his pension benefits.
Restrictive Covenants
In exchange for the benefits described above, each executive agrees not to (i) disclose the Company's confidential information; (ii) compete against the Company for 12 months after termination; (iii) solicit the Company's employees or customers for 12 months after termination; or (iv) disparage the Company for 12 months after termination.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

For avoidance of doubt, you will not be required to waive your rights to receive the payment under paragraph 8(e)(i) if you wish to be released from paragraph 7(a).
