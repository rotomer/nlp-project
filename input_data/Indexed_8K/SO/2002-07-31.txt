(b) The purchase price per Preferred Security to be paid by the several Underwriters for the Preferred Securities shall be an amount equal to the initial public offering price set forth on Schedule II, which is a fixed price determined by agreement between the Representatives and the Offerors. As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitments hereunder and in view of the fact that the proceeds of the sale of the Preferred Securities will be used to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes of the Company, the Company hereby agrees to pay on the Closing Date (as defined below) to Salomon Smith Barney Inc., for the accounts of the several Underwriters, a commission per Preferred Security as set forth on Schedule II for the Preferred Securities to be delivered by the Trust hereunder on the Closing Date.

It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized Salomon Smith Barney Inc., for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Preferred Securities which it has agreed to purchase. Salomon Smith Barney Inc., individually and not as a Representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Preferred Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Date, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder. (d) The certificate(s) for the Preferred Securities will be made available for examination and packaging by the Representatives not later than 12:00 Noon, New York time, on the last business day prior to the Closing Date. (e) On the Closing Date, the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, the commission payable at such time to the Underwriters under Section 2(b) hereof by wire transfer to Salomon Smith Barney Inc. in federal funds. Section 3. COVENANTS OF THE OFFERORS. ------------------------- Each of the Offerors jointly and severally covenants with each Underwriter as follows: (a) The Offerors, on or prior to the Closing Date, will deliver to the Underwriters conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of all amendments thereto, heretofore or hereafter made, including any post-effective amendment (in each case including all exhibits filed therewith, and including unsigned copies of each consent and certificate included therein or filed as an exhibit thereto, except exhibits incorporated by reference, unless specifically requested). As soon as the Company is advised thereof, it will advise the Representatives orally of the issuance of any stop order under the Securities Act with respect to the Registration Statement, or the institution of any proceedings therefor, of which the Company shall have received notice, and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to secure the prompt removal thereof, if issued. The Offerors will deliver to the Underwriters sufficient conformed copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus and of all supplements and amendments thereto (in each case without exhibits) for distribution to each Underwriter and, from time to time, as many copies of the Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. (b) The Offerors will furnish the Underwriters with copies of each amendment and supplement to the Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus relating to the offering of the Preferred Securities in such quantities as the Underwriters may from time to time reasonably request. If, during the period (not exceeding nine months) when the delivery of a prospectus shall be required by law in connection with the sale of any Preferred Securities by an Underwriter or dealer, any event relating to or affecting the Company, or of which the Company shall be advised in writing by the Underwriters, shall occur, which in the opinion of the Company or of Underwriters' counsel should be set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Final Supplemented Prospectus in order to make the Final Supplemented Prospectus not misleading in the light of the circumstances when it is delivered, or if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such period to amend or supplement the Final Supplemented Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Company forthwith will (i) notify the Underwriters to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Preferred Securities and (ii) at its expense, make any such filing or prepare and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or supplements or an amendment or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus which will supplement or amend the Final Supplemented Prospectus so that, as supplemented or amended, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Final Supplemented Prospectus is delivered, not misleading or which will effect any other necessary compliance. In case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus in connection with the sale of any Preferred Securities after the expiration of the period specified in the preceding sentence, the Company, upon the request of such Underwriter, will furnish to such Underwriter, at the expense of such Underwriter, a reasonable quantity of a supplemented or amended prospectus, or supplements or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus, complying with Section 10(a) of the Securities Act. During the period specified in the second sentence of this subsection, the Company will continue to prepare and file with the Commission on a timely basis all documents or amendments required under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; provided, that the Company shall not file such documents or amendments without also furnishing copies thereof prior to such filing to the Representatives and Dewey Ballantine LLP. (c) The Offerors will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Preferred Securities and, to the extent required or advisable, the Preferred Securities Guarantee and the Junior Subordinated Notes, for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and the other jurisdictions of the United States as the Representatives may designate; provided, however, that none of the Offerors shall be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to file a consent to service of process or to file annual reports or to comply with any other requirements in connection with such qualification deemed by the Company to be unduly burdensome. (d) The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable but not later than 45 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement of the Company (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the rules and regulations under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement. (e) The Offerors will use best efforts to effect the listing of the Preferred Securities on the New York Stock Exchange; if the Preferred Securities are exchanged for Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of the Junior Subordinated Notes on any exchange on which the Preferred Securities are then listed. (f) During a period of 15 days from the date of this Agreement, neither the Trust, SoCo Capital nor the Company will, without the Representatives' prior written consent, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any preferred securities, any security convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for preferred securities or junior subordinated notes or any debt securities substantially similar to the Junior Subordinated Notes or equity securities substantially similar to the Preferred Securities (except for the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Preferred Securities issued pursuant to this Agreement).

(7) On the Closing Date, the Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter dated the Closing Date to the effect that: (A) they are independent public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations under the Securities Act and (B) on the basis of certain limited procedures performed through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of such letter, namely (i) reading the minute books of the Company; (ii) performing the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants used for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 71, "Interim Financial Information", on the unaudited financial statements, if any, of the Company incorporated in the Prospectus and of the latest available unaudited financial statements of the Company, if any, for any calendar quarter subsequent to the date of those incorporated in the Prospectus; and (iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding such unaudited financial statements or any specified unaudited amounts derived therefrom (it being understood that the foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments made in such letter, and accordingly that Deloitte & Touche LLP make no representations as to the sufficiency of such procedures for the Underwriters' purposes), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (1) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, incorporated in the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) such unaudited condensed financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; (3) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Interest and Income Taxes, Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change, Consolidated Net Income and the unaudited Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Earnings to Fixed Charges Plus Preferred Dividend Requirements (Pre-Income Tax Basis) set forth in the Final Prospectus Supplement do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (4) as of a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there has been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any decrease in net assets as compared with amounts shown in the latest unaudited balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes or decreases which (i) the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (iv) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, or (v) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Interest and Income Taxes and Consolidated Net Income and the unaudited Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Earnings to Fixed Charges Plus Preferred Dividend Requirements (Pre-Income Tax Basis) for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which if available shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. (8) On the Closing Date, Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Offerors, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters. (9) On the Closing Date, the Preferred Securities shall have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange upon notice of issuance. (10) On the Closing Date, the Representatives shall have received a certificate of a vice president of the Company certifying that a Special Event (as defined in the Prospectus) shall not have occurred and be continuing. (11) That no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement (including any filing made by the Company pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act) shall be unsatisfactory in form to Dewey Ballantine LLP or shall contain information (other than with respect to an amendment or supplement relating solely to the activity of any Underwriter or Underwriters) which, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, shall materially impair the marketability of the Preferred Securities. (12) The Offerors shall have performed their respective obligations when and as provided under this Agreement. If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Offerors at any time prior to the Closing Date, and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4, 7 and 9(b) hereof. Section 6. CONDITIONS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE OFFERORS. --------------------------------------------- The obligations of the Offerors shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 5(a) and in Section 5(b). In case such conditions shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company by mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Underwriters. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 4, 7 and 9(b) hereof. Section 7. INDEMNIFICATION. --------------- (a) The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, Exchange Act or otherwise, and to reimburse the Underwriters and such controlling person or persons, if any, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, if the Offerors shall furnish to the Underwriters any amendments or any supplements thereto, or shall make any filings pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act which are incorporated therein by reference, in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission which was made in such Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus, Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by, or through the Representatives on behalf of, any Underwriter for use therein and except that this indemnity with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, if the Offerors shall have furnished any amendment or supplement thereto, shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or of any person controlling such Underwriter) on account of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arising from the sale of the Preferred Securities to any person if a copy of the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus (exclusive of documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3), as the same may then be amended or supplemented, shall not have been sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person with or prior to the written confirmation of the sale involved and the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was corrected in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus as supplemented or amended at the time of such confirmation. Each Underwriter agrees, within ten days after the receipt by it of notice of the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought by it, or by any person controlling it, from the Offerors on account of its agreement contained in this Section 7, to notify the Offerors in writing of the commencement thereof but the omission of such Underwriter so to notify the Offerors of any such action shall not release the Offerors from any liability which it may have to such Underwriter or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7. In case any such action shall be brought against the Underwriters or any such person controlling such Underwriters and such Underwriter shall notify the Offerors of the commencement thereof as above provided, the Offerors shall be entitled to participate in (and, to the extent that they shall wish, including the selection of counsel, to direct) the defense thereof, at their own expense. In case the Offerors elect to direct such defense and select such counsel, any Underwriter or controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or controlling person unless the employment of such counsel has been authorized in writing by the Offerors in connection with defending such action. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent. (b) The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as due from the Trust under Section 7(a) hereunder. (c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, SoCo Capital, their directors and such of their officers who have signed the Registration Statement, the Trust and each other Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Offerors or any such other Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Offerors set forth in Section 7(a) hereof, but only with respect to alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or such documents as amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Offerors by, or through the Representatives on behalf of, such Underwriter for use therein. Section 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. ----------------------------------------------- All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers or Trustees of the Offerors submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by, or on behalf of the Offerors and shall survive delivery of the Preferred Securities to the Underwriters. Section 9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. ------------------------ (a) The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Offerors, at any time at or prior to the Closing Date if (i) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended, (ii) minimum or maximum ranges for prices shall have been generally established on the New York Stock Exchange by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency affecting the United States, in any such case provided for in clauses (i) through (iv) with the result that, in the reasonable judgement of the Representatives, the marketability of the Preferred Securities shall have been materially impaired. (b) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters pursuant to subsection (a) above or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Offerors to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Offerors shall be unable to perform their obligations under this Agreement, then in any such case, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters, severally, for the reasonable fees and disbursements of Dewey Ballantine LLP and for the out of pocket expenses (in an amount not exceeding a total of $10,000) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Preferred Securities and, upon such reimbursement, the Offerors shall be absolved from any further liability hereunder, except as provided in Sections 4 and 7. Section 10. DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS. ------------------------------------------ If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase the Preferred Securities that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Preferred Securities, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Preferred Securities, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Offerors shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Final Supplemental Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

Incorporated 1585 Broadway New York, New York 10036 Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 390 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013 As Representatives of the Underwriters SOUTHERN COMPANY CAPITAL TRUST VI ____ % TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel to The Southern Company (the "Company") in connection with (i) the formation of (a) Southern Company Capital Trust VI, a Delaware statutory business trust (the "Trust"), pursuant to the amended and restated trust agreement dated __________, 2002 among Southern Company Capital Funding, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SoCo Capital") and the trustees named therein (the "Trust Agreement") and (b) SoCo Capital (SoCo Capital along with the Company and the Trust being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Offerors"); (ii) the Trust's issuance and sale of Trust Preferred Securities evidencing approximately a 97% undivided interest in the Trust (the "Preferred Securities"); (iii) the Trust's issuance and sale of Common Securities evidencing approximately a 3% undivided interest in the Trust (the "Common Securities"); (iv) SoCo Capital's issuance and sale to the Trust of $___________ of its Series F 7.125% Junior Subordinated Notes due June 30, 2042 (the "Notes") pursuant to a Subordinated Note Indenture dated as of June 1, 1997, among SoCo Capital, the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of __________ __, 2002 (collectively, the "Indenture"); (v) the Agreement as to Expenses and Liabilities dated as of __________ 1, 2002, between the Company and the Trust (the "Agreement as to Expenses and Liabilities"); (vi) its issuance of a guarantee (the "Preferred Securities Guarantee") of the Preferred Securities pursuant to a Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement dated as of __________ 1, 2002 (the "Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement") between the Company and ___________________, as trustee; and (vii) its issuance of a guarantee (the "Notes Guarantee") of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. The Preferred Securities are being sold to you today pursuant to the terms of a Underwriting Agreement dated __________, 2002 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, SoCo Capital, the Trust and the underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters") for whom you are acting as Representatives. This opinion is being delivered to you as Representatives pursuant to Section 5(c)(1) thereof. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-65178, 333-65178-01, 333-65178-02 and 333-65178-03) pertaining to the Preferred Securities (the "Registration Statement") filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and the prospectus dated ___________, 2001, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated __________, 2002 (the "Prospectus"), which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 (the "Form 10-K"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarters ended ________________________ and the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company dated _______________ (the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing (except the certificates representing the Preferred Securities and the Notes, of which we have examined specimens), and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion, relying as to matters of New York law upon the opinion dated the date hereof rendered to you by Dewey Ballantine LLP and as to matters of Delaware law upon the opinion dated the date hereof rendered to you by Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A. that: 1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement, the Indenture, the Agreement as to Expenses and Liabilities and the Underwriting Agreement. 2. SoCo Capital has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business, as described in the Prospectus, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture and to purchase, own and hold the Common Securities issued by the Trust and to issue the Notes. 3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Offerors of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Offerors. 4. All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and delivery of the Notes, the Preferred Securities Guarantee and the Notes Guarantee and the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities have been obtained; such orders are sufficient for the issuance and delivery of the Notes, the Common Securities, the Preferred Securities Guarantee and the Notes Guarantee and the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities; the issuance and delivery of the Notes, the Preferred Securities Guarantee and the Notes Guarantee and the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities conform in all material respects with the terms of such orders; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States federal governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and delivery of the Notes, the Preferred Securities Guarantee and the Notes Guarantee and the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement. 5. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by SoCo Capital and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Debt Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of SoCo Capital, enforceable against SoCo Capital in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of SoCo Capital's obligations under the Indenture may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and each of the Indenture and the Notes Guarantee conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Prospectus. 6. The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by SoCo Capital and, when authenticated by the Debt Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor, will constitute valid and binding obligations of SoCo Capital, enforceable against SoCo Capital in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of SoCo Capital's obligations under the Notes may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Prospectus. 7. Each of the Indenture and the Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture and the Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Prospectus. 8. The Agreement as to Expenses and Liabilities has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Agreement as to Expenses and Liabilities may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Agreement as to Expenses and Liabilities conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Prospectus. 9. Each of the Indenture, the Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement and the Trust Agreement has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. 10. Neither the Company, SoCo Capital nor the Trust is and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Preferred Securities, will be an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 11. The Trust Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by SoCo Capital, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of SoCo Capital, enforceable against SoCo Capital in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of SoCo Capital's obligations under the Trust Agreement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 12. The statements as to matters of law and legal conclusions contained in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences" are correct in all material respects. 13. To the best of our knowledge, all of the issued and outstanding Common Securities of the Trust are directly owned by SoCo Capital, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equitable right. 14. The execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement and the Trust Agreement; the issuance by the Trust of the Preferred Securities and the Common Securities; the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated thereby; the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and SoCo Capital of the Underwriting Agreement; and the compliance by the Trust with its obligations thereunder do not and will not result in any violation of the Trust Agreement or related Certificate of Trust, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Trust under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument known to us to which the Trust is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Trust), (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Trust (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government, governmental instrumentality, or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Trust or any of its properties; and to the best of our knowledge the Trust is not a party to or otherwise bound by any agreement other than those which are described in the Prospectus. 15. The Common Securities have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and (subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement), when issued and delivered by the Trust to SoCo Capital against payment therefor as described in the Prospectus, will be validly issued fully paid and nonassessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust; and the issuance of the Common Securities is not subject to preemptive or other similar rights. 16. The Preferred Securities have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and (subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement), when delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust; the holders of the Preferred Securities will (subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement) be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability under Delaware law as is extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the general corporation law of the State of Delaware; the issuance of the Preferred Securities is not subject to preemptive or other similar rights; and the Preferred Securities conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Prospectus.

In particular, we have not reviewed any document (other than the documents listed in paragraphs (a) through (k) above) that is referred to in or incorporated by reference into the documents reviewed by us. We have assumed that there exists no provision in any document that we have not reviewed that is inconsistent with the opinions stated herein. We have conducted no independent factual investigation of our own but rather have relied solely upon the foregoing documents, the statements and information set forth therein and the additional matters recited or assumed herein, all of which we have assumed to be true, complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to all documents examined by us, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as authentic originals, (ii) the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies or forms, and (iii) the genuineness of all signatures. For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed (i) the Trust Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof, including with respect to the creation, operation and termination of the Trust, and the Trust Agreement and the Certificate are in full force and effect and have not been amended, (ii) except to the extent provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 below, the due organization or due formation or due creation, as the case may be, and valid existence in good standing of each party to the documents examined by us under the laws of the jurisdiction governing its organization or formation or creation, (iii) the legal capacity of natural persons who are parties to the documents examined by us, (iv) except to the extent provided in paragraph 8 below, the power and authority of each of the parties to the documents examined by us to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, such documents, (v) except to the extent provided in paragraph 8 below, the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties thereto of all documents examined by us, (vi) the receipt by each Person to whom a Trust Security is to be issued by the Trust (collectively, the "Trust Security Holders") of a Trust Securities Certificate for such Trust Security and the payment for the Trust Security acquired by it, in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Prospectus, (vii) the issuance and sale of the Trust Securities to the Trust Security Holders in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Prospectus and (viii) that SoCo Capital and the Company derive no income from or connected with sources within the State of Delaware and have no assets, activities (other than having a registered agent as required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the filing of documents and payment of franchise taxes with the Delaware Secretary of State). We have not participated in the preparation of the Prospectus. This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding the securities laws of the State of Delaware), and we have not considered and express no opinion on the laws of any other jurisdiction, including federal laws and rules and regulations relating thereto. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to Delaware laws and rules, regulations and orders thereunder which are currently in effect. Based upon the foregoing, and upon our examination of such questions of law and statutes of the State of Delaware as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good standing as a business trust under the Delaware Business Trust Act, 12 Del. C.ss.3801, et seq. (the "Business Trust Act"), and all filings required under the laws of the ------------ State of Delaware with respect to the creation and valid existence of the Trust as a business trust have been made. 2. SoCo Capital has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate power and authority under the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture and to purchase, own and hold the Common Securities issued by the Trust and to issue the Notes. 3. Under the Business Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Trust has the business trust power and authority to (i) own property and conduct its business, all as described in the Prospectus, (ii) execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement, (iii) issue and perform its obligations under the Trust Securities, and (iv) perform its obligations under the Trust Agreement. 4. The Trust Securities have been duly authorized by the Trust Agreement and will be duly and validly issued undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. Subject to the qualifications set forth in paragraph 7 below, the Preferred Securities will be fully paid and nonassessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. Under the Business Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Trust Securities are not subject to any preemptive or other similar rights. 5. Under the Business Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary business trust action on the part of the Trust. 6. No authorization, approval, consent or order of any Delaware court or Delaware governmental authority or Delaware agency is required to be obtained by the Trust, the Company or SoCo Capital solely as a result of (i) the issuance and sale of the Preferred Securities, (ii) the issuance and delivery of the Notes and (iii) the issuance and delivery of the Guarantees. 7. The Persons to whom Preferred Securities are to be issued by the Trust (collectively, the "Preferred Security Holders"), as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We note that the Preferred Security Holders may be obligated, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, to (i) provide indemnity and/or security in connection with and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from transfers or exchanges of Preferred Securities Certificates and the issuance of replacement Preferred Securities Certificates and (ii) provide security or indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Property Trustee to exercise its rights and powers under the Trust Agreement. 8. The Trust Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of SoCo Capital and the Trustees, and is enforceable against SoCo Capital and the Trustees, in accordance with its terms. 9. The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Trust Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement and the Trust Agreement, the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Trust Agreement and compliance by the Trust with its obligations thereunder do not violate (i) any of the provisions of the Certificate or the Trust Agreement or (ii) any applicable Delaware law or Delaware administrative regulation. 10. We have reviewed the statements in the Prospectus under the caption "Southern Company Capital Trust VI" and, insofar as they contain statements of Delaware law, such statements are fairly presented. The opinion expressed in paragraph 8 above is subject as to enforcement, to the effect upon the Trust Agreement of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, reorganization, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, (ii) principles of equity, including applicable law relating to fiduciary duties (regardless of whether considered and applied in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (iii) the effect of applicable public policy on the enforceability of provisions relating to indemnification. We consent to your relying as to matters of Delaware law upon this opinion in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. We consent to the law firms of Troutman Sanders LLP and Dewey Ballantine LLP relying as to matters of Delaware law upon this opinion in connection with opinions to be rendered by them pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. Except as stated above, without our prior written consent, this opinion may not be furnished or quoted to, or relied upon by, any other Person for any purpose.

SECTION 102.......Definitions. The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture. "Deferred Interest" means each installment of interest not paid during any Extension Period, and interest thereon. Deferred installments of interest shall bear interest at the rate of 7.125% per annum from the applicable Interest Payment Date to the date of payment, compounded quarterly, to the extent permitted by applicable law. "Extension Period" means any period during which the Company has elected to defer payments of interest, which deferral may be for a period of up to twenty (20) consecutive quarters. "Interest Payment Dates" means March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing September 30, 2002. "Investment Company Act Event" means that the Company shall have received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as a result of the occurrence of a change in law or regulation or a written change in interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Securities Trust is or will be considered an "investment company" that is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which change becomes effective on or after the Original Issue Date. "Original Issue Date" means July 31, 2002. "Regular Record Date" means, with respect to each Interest Payment Date, the close of business (i) on the Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date if (A) the Preferred Securities issued by the Securities Trust are in book-entry only form or (B) the Series F Notes have been distributed to holders of the Trust Securities of the Securities Trust and such Series F Notes are in book-entry only form or (ii) on the 15th calendar day preceding such Interest Payment Date if neither such Preferred Securities nor the Series F Notes are in book-entry only form.

SECTION 103.......Payment of Principal and Interest. The unpaid principal amount of the Series F Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 7.125% per annum until paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be paid quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to the Person in whose name the Series F Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity of principal or on a Redemption Date as provided herein will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. So long as an Extension Period is not occurring, any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person or Persons in whose name the Series F Notes are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee ("Special Record Date"), notice whereof shall be given to Holders of the Series F Notes not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Series F Notes shall be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture. Payments of interest on the Series F Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Series F Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Series F Notes is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest, if any) due at the Stated Maturity or earlier redemption of the Series F Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Series F Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto. The Company shall pay, as additional interest on the Series F Notes, when due to the United States or any other taxing authority, the amounts set forth in clause (i) of the definition of Additional Interest. SECTION 104.......Deferral of Interest Payments. The Company has the right at any time and from time to time to extend the interest payment period of the Series F Notes for up to twenty (20) consecutive quarters (each, an "Extension Period"), but not beyond the Stated Maturity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has no right to extend its obligation to pay such amounts as are defined in clause (i) of the definition of Additional Interest. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further extend the interest payment period, provided that such Extension Period, together with all such previous and further extensions of that Extension Period, shall not exceed twenty (20) consecutive quarters. Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Interest then due, the Company may select a new Extension Period, subject to the above limitations and requirements. Upon the termination of any Extension Period, which termination shall be on an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all Deferred Interest on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to the Person in whose name the Series F Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that Deferred Interest payable at Stated Maturity or on any Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. The Company shall give the Holder or Holders of the Series F Notes and the Trustee notice, as provided in Sections 105 and 106, respectively, of the Original Indenture, of its selection or extension of an Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the earlier of (i) the Regular Record Date relating to the Interest Payment Date on which the Extension Period is to commence or relating to the Interest Payment Date on which an Extension Period that is being extended would otherwise terminate, or (ii) the date the Company or Securities Trust is required to give notice to the New York Stock Exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization of the record date or the date such distributions are payable. The Company shall cause the Securities Trust to give notice of the Company's selection of such Extension Period to Holders of the Trust Securities. The month in which any notice is given pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence of this Section shall constitute the first month of the first quarter of the twenty (20) quarters, which comprise the Maximum Extension Period. At any time any of the foregoing notices are given to the Trustee, the Company shall give to the Paying Agent for the Series F Notes such information as said Paying Agent shall reasonably require in order to fulfill its tax reporting obligations with respect to such Series F Notes. SECTION 105.......Denominations. The Series F Notes may be issued in the denominations of $25, or any integral multiple thereof. SECTION 106.......Global Securities. If the Series F Notes are distributed to Holders of the Trust Securities of the Securities Trust in liquidation of such Holders' interests therein, the Series F Notes will be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary (which shall be The Depository Trust Company) or its nominee. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Series F Notes represented by the Global Security will not be exchangeable for, and will not otherwise be issuable as, Series F Notes in definitive form. The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee. Owners of beneficial interests in such a Global Security will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and no Global Security representing a Series F Note shall be exchangeable, except for another Global Security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or to a successor Depositary or its nominee. The rights of Holders of such Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary. A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Series F Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed, or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed, (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) there shall have occurred an Event of Default with respect to the Series F Notes. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Series F Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct. SECTION 107.......Transfer. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of Series F Notes, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, transfer or exchange any Series F Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business fifteen (15) days before the day of the mailing of a notice identifying the serial numbers of the Series F Notes to be called for redemption, and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing, or (b) to transfer or exchange any Series F Notes theretofore selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Series F Note redeemed in part. SECTION 108.......Redemption. The Series F Notes shall be subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time on or after July 31, 2007, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if a redemption in part shall result in the delisting of the Preferred Securities issued by the Securities Trust, the Company may only redeem the Series F Notes in whole. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Special Event at any time, the Company may, within ninety (90) days following the occurrence thereof and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, elect to redeem the Series F Notes, in whole, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus any accrued but unpaid interest (including Additional Interest) to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of the Series F Notes in part only, a new Series F Note or Notes for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or names of the Holders thereof upon the surrender thereof. The Series F Notes will not have a sinking fund. Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in Section 1104 of the Original Indenture. Any redemption of less than all of the Series F Notes shall, with respect to the principal thereof, be divisible by $25. ARTICLE 2 Miscellaneous Provisions SECTION 201.......Recitals by Company. The recitals in this Fourth Supplemental Indenture are made by the Company only and not by the Trustee, and all of the provisions contained in the Original Indenture in respect of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and duties of the Trustee shall be applicable in respect of Series F Notes and of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture as fully and with like effect as if set forth herein in full. SECTION 202.......Ratification and Incorporation of Original Indenture. As heretofore supplemented and as supplemented hereby, the Original Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Original Indenture, as heretofore supplemented and as further supplemented by this Fourth Supplemental Indenture, shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument. SECTION 203.......Executed in Counterparts. This Fourth Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. SECTION 204.......Listing of Notes. If the Series F Notes are to be issued as a Global Security in connection with the distribution of the Series F Notes to the Holders of the Preferred Securities issued by the Securities Trust, the Company will use its best efforts to list such Series F Notes on the New York Stock Exchange or any such other exchange on which such Preferred Securities are then listed and traded. SECTION 205.......Trustee Not Liable. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder because of circumstances beyond its control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, flood, war (whether declared or undeclared), terrorism, fire, riot, embargo, government action, including any laws, ordinances, regulations, governmental action or the like which delay, restrict or prohibit the providing of the services contemplated by this Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Trustees are authorized and directed to conduct the affairs of the Trust and to operate the Trust so that the Trust will not be deemed to be an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or taxed as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes and so that the Junior Subordinated Notes will be treated as indebtedness of the Depositor for United States federal income tax purposes. In this connection, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Trust or this Trust Agreement, that each of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees determines in its discretion to be necessary or desirable for such purposes, as long as such action does not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Preferred Securities. Section 2.08 Assets of Trust. The assets of the Trust shall consist of the Trust Property. --------------- Section 2.09 Title to Trust Property. Legal title to all Trust Property shall be vested at all times in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) and shall be held and administered by the Property Trustee for the benefit of the Securityholders and the Trust in accordance with this Trust Agreement. The right, title and interest of the Property Trustee to the Junior Subordinated Notes shall vest automatically in each Person who may thereafter be appointed as Property Trustee in accordance with the terms hereof. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective whether or not conveyancing documents have been executed and delivered. Section 2.10 Mergers and Consolidations of the Trust. The Trust may not consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other body, except as described below or otherwise provided in this Trust Agreement. The Trust may at the request of the Company, with the consent of the Administrative Trustees and without the consent of the Holders of the Trust Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by a trust organized as such under the laws of any state; provided, that (i) such successor entity either (x) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Trust with respect to the Trust Securities or (y) substitutes for the Preferred Securities other securities having substantially the same terms as the Trust Securities (herein referred to as the "Successor Securities") so long as the Successor Securities rank the same as the Trust Securities rank in priority with respect to Distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) the Company expressly appoints a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee as the holder of legal title to the Junior Subordinated Notes, (iii) the Preferred Securities or any Successor Securities are listed, or any Successor Securities will be listed upon notification of issuance, on any national securities exchange or other organization on which the Preferred Securities are then listed, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement does not cause the Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (v) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Trust Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (vi) such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Trust, (vii) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, or replacement, the Company and the Property Trustee have received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Trust Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (B) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement, neither the Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and (viii) the Company guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of 100% in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or replacement would cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as other than a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. ARTICLE III Payment Account Section 3.01 Payment Account. --------------- (a) On or prior to the Issue Date, the Property Trustee shall establish the Payment Account. The Property Trustee and an agent of the Property Trustee shall have exclusive control and sole right of withdrawal with respect to the Payment Account for the purpose of making deposits in and withdrawals from the Payment Account in accordance with this Trust Agreement. All monies and other property deposited or held from time to time in the Payment Account shall be held by the Property Trustee in the Payment Account for the exclusive benefit of the Securityholders and for distribution as herein provided, including (and subject to) any priority of payments provided for herein. (b) The Property Trustee shall deposit in the Payment Account, promptly upon receipt, all payments of principal or interest on, and any other payments or proceeds with respect to, the Junior Subordinated Notes. Amounts held in the Payment Account shall not be invested by the Property Trustee pending distribution thereof. ARTICLE IV Distributions; Redemption Section 4.01 Distributions. ------------- (a) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative and accrue from the Issue Date and, except in the event that the Depositor exercises its right to extend the interest payment period for the Junior Subordinated Notes pursuant to Section 104 of the Supplemental Indenture, shall be payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2002. If any date on which Distributions are otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, payment of such Distribution shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case, with the same force and effect as if made on such date (each such date, a "Distribution Date"). (b) Distributions payable on the Trust Securities shall be fixed at a rate of 7.125% per annum of the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities. The amount of Distributions payable for any full quarterly period shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. If the interest payment period for the Junior Subordinated Notes is extended pursuant to Section 104 of the Supplemental Indenture (an "Extension Period"), then the rate per annum at which Distributions on the Trust Securities accumulate shall be increased by an amount such that the aggregate amount of Distributions that accumulate on all Trust Securities during any such Extension Period is equal to the aggregate amount of interest (including interest payable on unpaid interest at the percentage rate per annum set forth above, compounded quarterly, to the extent permitted by applicable law) that accrues during any such Extension Period on the Junior Subordinated Notes. The payment of such deferred interest, together with interest thereon, will be distributed to the Holders of the Trust Securities as received at the end of any Extension Period. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shall include the Additional Amounts, if any. (c) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made and shall be deemed payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Trust has legally and immediately available funds in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions. (d) Distributions, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Trust Securities on each Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record date, which shall be (i) the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the relevant Distribution Date, as long as the Trust Securities remain in book-entry only form or (ii) the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding the relevant Distribution Date if the Trust Securities are no longer in book-entry only form. Each Trust Security upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Trust Security shall carry the rights of Distributions accrued (including Additional Amounts, if any) and unpaid, and to accrue (including Additional Amounts, if any), which were carried by such other Trust Security. Section 4.02 Redemption. ---------- (a) On each Redemption Date with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the Redemption Price. (b) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of redemption shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price; (iii) the CUSIP number; (iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the total Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities to be redeemed; and (v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Trust Security to be redeemed and that Distributions thereon will cease to accrue on and after such date. (c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be deemed payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds legally and immediately available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price. (d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Preferred Securities, then, by 2:00 p.m. New York time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.02(c), the Property Trustee will, so long as the Preferred Securities are in book-entry only form, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for the Preferred Securities funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price. If the Preferred Securities are not in book-entry only form, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.02(c), shall irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders thereof upon surrender of their Preferred Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest, and such Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, payment of such Redemption Price shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case, with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of Trust Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Trust or by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accrue at the then applicable rate, from such Redemption Date originally established by the Trust for such Preferred Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid. (e) If less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated 3% to the Common Securities and 97% to the Preferred Securities, with such adjustments that each amount so allocated shall be divisible by $25. The particular Preferred Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Preferred Securities not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Property Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for a redemption of portions (equal to $25 or integral multiple thereof) of the Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities of a denomination larger than $25; provided, however, that before undertaking redemption of the Preferred Securities on other than a pro rata basis, the Property Trustee shall have received an Opinion of Counsel that the status of the Trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes would not be adversely affected. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Preferred Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Preferred Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Preferred Securities shall relate, in the case of any Preferred Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. (f) Subject to the foregoing provisions of Section 4.02 and to applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Company, the Guarantor or their Affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, purchase outstanding Preferred Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement. Section 4.03 Subordination of Common Securities. ---------------------------------- (a) Payment of Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, and the Redemption Price of, the Trust Securities, as applicable, shall be made pro rata based on the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date or Redemption Date an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, or Redemption Price of, any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on all Outstanding Preferred Securities for all distribution periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Preferred Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, or Redemption Price of, Preferred Securities then due and payable. (b) In the case of the occurrence of any Indenture Event of Default, the Holder of Common Securities will be deemed to have waived any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effect of all such Events of Default with respect to the Preferred Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until any such Events of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Preferred Securities have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Preferred Securities and not the Holder of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Preferred Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf. Section 4.04 Payment Procedures. Payments in respect of the Preferred Securities shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities Register or, if the Preferred Securities are held by a Clearing Agency, such Distributions shall be made to the Clearing Agency, which shall credit the relevant Persons' accounts at such Clearing Agency on the applicable distribution dates. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner as shall be mutually agreed between the Property Trustee and the Holder of the Common Securities. Section 4.05 Tax Returns and Reports. The Administrative Trustee(s) shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Depositor's expense, and file all United States federal, state and local tax and information returns and reports required to be filed by or in respect of the Trust. The Administrative Trustee(s) shall provide or cause to be provided on a timely basis to each Holder any Internal Revenue Service form required to be so provided in respect of the Trust Securities. ARTICLE V Trust Securities Certificates Section 5.01 Initial Ownership. Upon the creation of the Trust by the contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.03 and until the issuance of the Trust Securities, and at any time during which no Trust Securities are outstanding, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficial owner of the Trust. Section 5.02 The Trust Securities Certificates. Each of the Preferred and Common Securities Certificates shall be issued in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples in excess thereof. The Trust Securities Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature of at least one Administrative Trustee. Trust Securities Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of authentication and delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates. A transferee of a Trust Securities Certificate shall become a Securityholder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Securityholder hereunder, upon due registration of such Trust Securities Certificate in such transferee's name pursuant to Section 5.04. Section 5.03 Authentication of Trust Securities Certificates. On the Issue Date, the Administrative Trustees shall cause Trust Securities Certificates, in an aggregate Liquidation Amount as provided in Sections 2.04 and 2.05, to be executed on behalf of the Trust, authenticated and delivered to or upon the written order of the Depositor signed by its Chairman of the Board, its President or any Vice President, without further corporate action by the Depositor, in authorized denominations. No Trust Securities Certificate shall entitle its holder to any benefit under this Trust Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless there shall appear on such Trust Securities Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit C or Exhibit A, as applicable, executed by at least one Administrative Trustee by manual signature; such authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Trust Securities Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication. Section 5.04 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Preferred Securities Certificates. The Securities Registrar shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.08, a Securities Register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Securities Registrar shall provide for the registration of Preferred Securities Certificates and the Common Securities Certificates (subject to Section 5.10 in the case of the Common Securities Certificates) and registration of transfers and exchanges of Preferred Securities Certificates as herein provided. The Property Trustee shall be the initial Securities Registrar. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Preferred Securities Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.08, the Administrative Trustees shall execute, authenticate and deliver in the name of the designated transferee or transferees one or more new Preferred Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount dated the date of authentication by the Administrative Trustee or Trustees. The Securities Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of any Preferred Securities that have been called for redemption. At the option of a Holder, Preferred Securities Certificates may be exchanged for other Preferred Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of the same class and of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount upon surrender of the Preferred Securities Certificates to be exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.08. Every Preferred Securities Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Administrative Trustees and the Securities Registrar duly executed by the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Preferred Securities Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be canceled and subsequently disposed of by the Securities Registrar in accordance with its customary practice. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Preferred Securities Certificates, but the Securities Registrar or the Administrative Trustees may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Preferred Securities Certificates. Section 5.05 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Trust Securities Certificates. If (a) any mutilated Trust Securities Certificate shall be surrendered to the Securities Registrar, or if the Securities Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Securities Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the Securities Registrar and the Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Administrative Trustees or any one of them on behalf of the Trust shall execute and authenticate and make available for delivery, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Securities Certificate, a new Trust Securities Certificate of like class, tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time. Section 5.06 Persons Deemed Securityholders. Prior to due presentation of a Trust Securities Certificate for registration of transfer, the Trustees or the Securities Registrar shall treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities Certificate shall be registered in the Securities Register as the owner of such Trust Securities Certificate for the purpose of receiving Distributions (subject to Section 4.01(d)) and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Trustees nor the Securities Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary. Section 5.07 Access to List of Securityholders' Names and Addresses. The Administrative Trustees shall furnish or cause to be furnished to (i) the Depositor and the Property Trustee semi-annually, not later than June 1 and December 1 in each year, and (ii) the Depositor or the Property Trustee, as the case may be, within 30 days after receipt by any Administrative Trustee of a request therefor from the Depositor or the Property Trustee, as the case may be, in writing, a list, in such form as the Depositor or the Property Trustee, as the case may be, may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Securityholders as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished; provided, that the Administrative Trustees shall not be obligated to provide such list at any time such list does not differ from the most recent list given to the Depositor and the Property Trustee by the Administrative Trustees or at any time the Property Trustee is the Securities Registrar. If three or more Securityholders or one or more Holders of Trust Securities Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the outstanding Liquidation Amount apply in writing to the Administrative Trustees, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Securityholders with respect to their rights under this Trust Agreement or under the Trust Securities Certificates and such application is accompanied by a copy of the communication that such applicants propose to transmit, then the Administrative Trustees shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford such applicants access during normal business hours to the current list of Securityholders. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Trust Securities Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold either the Depositor or the Administrative Trustees accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived. Section 5.08 Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Administrative Trustees shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Preferred Securities Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Trustees in respect of the Trust Securities Certificates may be served. The Administrative Trustees initially designate Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, 100 Plaza One, MS: JCY03-0603, Jersey City, New Jersey 07311 Attention: Corporate Trust and Agency Group, Manager, Project Finance Group, as its principal agency for such purposes. The Administrative Trustees shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor and to the Securityholders of any change in the location of the Securities Register or any such office or agency. Section 5.09 Appointment of Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall make Distributions and other payments provided hereby to Securityholders from the Payment Account and shall report the amounts of such Distributions and payments to the Property Trustee and the Administrative Trustees. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account for the purpose of making the Distributions and payments provided hereby. The Administrative Trustees may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if such Trustees determine in their sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Property Trustee, and it may choose any co-paying agent that is acceptable to the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor. In the event that a Paying Agent shall resign or be removed, the Administrative Trustees shall appoint a successor that is acceptable to the Depositor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Administrative Trustees shall cause such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Administrative Trustees to execute and deliver to the Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Securityholders in trust for the benefit of the Securityholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Securityholders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Property Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee. The provisions of Sections 8.01, 8.03 and 8.06 shall apply to the Property Trustee also in its role as Paying Agent, for so long as the Property Trustee shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise. Section 5.10 Ownership of Common Securities by Depositor. On the Issue Date, the Depositor shall acquire, and thereafter retain, beneficial and record ownership of the Common Securities. Any attempted transfer of the Common Securities, except for transfers by operation of law or to an Affiliate of the Guarantor or the Depositor or a permitted successor under Section 801 of the Subordinated Indenture, shall be void. The Administrative Trustees shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating "THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT REFERRED TO HEREIN". Section 5.11 Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates; Common Securities Certificate. (a) The Preferred Securities Certificates, upon original issuance, will be issued in the form of a typewritten Preferred Securities Certificate or Certificates representing Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates, to be delivered to The Depository Trust Company, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Trust. Such Preferred Securities Certificate or Certificates shall initially be registered on the Securities Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency, and no Owner will receive a definitive Preferred Securities Certificate representing such beneficial owner's interest in such Preferred Securities, except as provided in Section 5.13. Unless and until Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates have been issued to Owners pursuant to Section 5.13: (i) the provisions of this Section 5.11(a) shall be in full force and effect; (ii) the Securities Registrar and the Trustees shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Trust Agreement relating to the Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates (including the payment of principal of and interest on the Book-Entry Preferred Securities and the giving of instructions or directions to Owners of Book-Entry Preferred Securities) as the sole Holder of Book-Entry Preferred Securities and shall have no obligations to the Owners thereof; (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall control; and (iv) the rights of the Owners of the Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Certificate Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 5.13, the Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments on the Preferred Securities to such Clearing Agency Participants. (b) A single Common Securities Certificate representing the Common Securities shall be issued to the Depositor in the form of a definitive Common Securities Certificate. Section 5.12 Notices to Clearing Agency. To the extent a notice or other communication to the Owners is required under this Trust Agreement, unless and until Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates shall have been issued to Owners pursuant to Section 5.13, the Trustees shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to Owners to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligations to the Owners. Section 5.13 Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates. If (i) the Depositor advises the Trustees in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Preferred Securities Certificates, and the Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor, or (ii) the Depositor at its option advises the Trustees in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency, then the Administrative Trustees shall notify the Clearing Agency and Holders of the Preferred Securities. Upon surrender to the Administrative Trustees of the typewritten Preferred Securities Certificate or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Administrative Trustees or any one of them shall execute and authenticate the Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. Neither the Securities Registrar nor the Trustees shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates, the Trustees shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates as Securityholders. The Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees, as evidenced by the execution thereof by the Administrative Trustees or any one of them. Section 5.14 Rights of Securityholders. The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.09, and the Securityholders shall not have any right or title therein other than the beneficial ownership interest in the assets of the Trust conferred by their Trust Securities, and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or other similar rights and when issued and delivered to Securityholders against payment of the purchase price therefor, except as otherwise provided in the Expense Agreement and Section 10.01 hereof, will be fully paid and nonassessable by the Trust. Except as otherwise provided in the Expense Agreement and Section 10.01 hereof, the Holders of the Trust Securities shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. ARTICLE VI Acts of Securityholders; Meetings; Voting Section 6.01 Limitations on Voting Rights. ---------------------------- (a) Except as provided in this Section, in Section 8.10 or Section 10.03 of this Trust Agreement, in the Subordinated Indenture, and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Preferred Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Securityholders from time to time as partners or members of an association. (b) So long as any Junior Subordinated Notes are held by the Property Trustee, the Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect to such Junior Subordinated Notes, (ii) waive any past default which is waivable under Section 513 of the Subordinated Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Subordinated Indenture or the Junior Subordinated Notes, where such consent shall be required, or to any other action, as holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes, under the Subordinated Indenture, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities; provided, however, that where a consent under the Subordinated Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Junior Subordinated Notes affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Trustees without the prior written consent of each Holder of Preferred Securities. The Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Preferred Securities, except pursuant to a subsequent vote of the Holders of Preferred Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Preferred Securities of any notice of default received from the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes on account of such action. (c) If any proposed amendment to this Trust Agreement provides for, or the Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Preferred Securities, whether by way of amendment to this Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Preferred Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes on account of such action. Section 6.02 Notice of Meetings. Notice of all meetings of the Preferred Securityholders, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Administrative Trustees pursuant to Section 10.08 to each Preferred Securityholder of record, at his registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. Section 6.03 Meetings of Preferred Securityholders. No annual meeting of Securityholders is required to be held. The Administrative Trustees, however, shall call a meeting of Securityholders to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Preferred Securityholders of record of 25% of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of Preferred Securityholders to vote on any matters as to which Preferred Securityholders are entitled to vote. Preferred Securityholders of record of 50% of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount), present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Securityholders. If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Preferred Securityholders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding more than 66-2/3% of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) held by the Preferred Securityholders of record present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Securityholders, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Section 6.04 Voting Rights. Securityholders shall be entitled to one vote for each $25 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Securityholders are entitled to vote. Section 6.05 Proxies, etc. At any meeting of Securityholders, any Securityholder entitled to vote may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Administrative Trustees, or with such other officer or agent of the Trust as the Administrative Trustees may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Securityholders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Securityholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution. Section 6.06 Securityholder Action by Written Consent. Any action which may be taken by Securityholders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Securityholders holding at least 66-2/3% of all outstanding Trust Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such other proportion thereof as shall be required by any express provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing (based upon their Liquidation Amount). Section 6.07 Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes. For the purposes of determining the Securityholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any Distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Securityholders or the payment of Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Securityholders of record for such purposes. Section 6.08 Acts of Securityholders. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Securityholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Securityholders in person or by an agent appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Administrative Trustees. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Securityholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustees deem sufficient. The ownership of Preferred Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Securityholder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Securityholder of the same Trust Security and the Securityholder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustees or the Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security. Without limiting the foregoing, a Securityholder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount. If any dispute shall arise between the Securityholders of Trust Securities and the Administrative Trustees or among such Securityholders or Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Securityholder or Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter. Section 6.09 Inspection of Records. Upon reasonable notice to the Trustees, the records of the Trust shall be open to inspection by Securityholders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Securityholder's interest as a Securityholder. ARTICLE VII Representations and Warranties of the Property Trustee and Delaware Trustee Section 7.01 Representations and Warranties of Property Trustee. The Trustee that acts as initial Property Trustee represents and warrants to the Trust and to the Depositor at the date of this Trust Agreement, and each Successor Property Trustee represents and warrants to the Trust and the Depositor at the time of the Successor Property Trustee's acceptance of its appointment as Property Trustee that: (a) the Property Trustee is a New York banking corporation with trust powers and authority to execute and deliver, and to carry out and perform its obligations under the terms of, this Trust Agreement; (b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Property Trustee of this Trust Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Property Trustee.

ARTICLE VIII The Trustees Section 8.01 Certain Duties and Responsibilities. ----------------------------------- (a) The rights, duties and responsibilities of the Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to them. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. (b) All payments made by the Property Trustee in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the income and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient income or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Securityholder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the income and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Trustees are not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.01(b) does not limit the liability of the Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act. Section 8.02 Notice of Defaults. Within 90 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.08, notice of any Event of Default known to the Property Trustee to the Securityholders, the Administrative Trustees, the Guarantor and the Depositor, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. Section 8.03 Certain Rights of Property Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.01 and except as provided by law: (i) the Property Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (ii) if (A) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action, or (B) in construing any of the provisions in this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein, or (C) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the Preferred Securityholders are entitled to vote under the terms of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Depositor requesting written instructions of the Depositor as to the course of action to be taken. The Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall be instructed in writing to take, or to refrain from taking, by the Depositor; provided, however, that if the Property Trustee does not receive such instructions of the Depositor within ten Business Days after it has delivered such notice, or such reasonably shorter period of time set forth in such notice (which to the extent practicable shall not be less than two Business Days), it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action not inconsistent with this Trust Agreement as it shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Securityholders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct; (iii) the Property Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (iv) the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Property Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (v) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Securityholders; and (vi) the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall be responsible for its own negligence or recklessness with respect to selection of any agent or attorney appointed by it hereunder. Section 8.04 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Trust, and the Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Trust of the proceeds of the Trust Securities in accordance with Section 2.05. The Property Trustee may conclusively assume that any funds held by it hereunder are legally available unless a Responsible Officer shall have received written notice from the Company, any Holder or any other Trustee that such funds are not legally available. Section 8.05 May Hold Securities. Except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article I, any Trustee or any other agent of the Trustees or the Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and may otherwise deal with the Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not a Trustee or such other agent. Section 8.06 Compensation; Fees; Indemnity. ----------------------------- The Depositor agrees: (1) to pay to the Trustees from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by the Trustees hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to their willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith; (3) to indemnify the Trustees for, and to hold the Trustees harmless against, any and all loss, damage, claims, liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith on their part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Trust Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending themselves against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder; (4) in no event shall the Trustee be liable for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action; and (5) in no event shall the Trustee be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder because of circumstances beyond its control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, flood, war (whether declared or undeclared), terrorism, fire, riot, embargo, government action, including any laws, ordinances, regulations, governmental action or the like which delay, restrict or prohibit the providing of the services contemplated by this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Section 8.06 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement. Section 8.07 Trustees Required; Eligibility. ------------------------------ (a) There shall at all times be a Property Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. The Property Trustee shall be a Person that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. (b) There shall at all times be one or more Administrative Trustees hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. Each Administrative Trustee shall be either a natural person who is at least 21 years of age or a legal entity that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. (c) There shall at all times be a Delaware Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities. The Delaware Trustee shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the State of Delaware or (ii) a legal entity authorized to conduct a trust business and with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. Section 8.08 Conflicting Interests. --------------------- If the Property Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Trust Agreement. To the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being trustee under the Guarantee. Section 8.09 Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee. -------------------------------- At any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Holder of the Common Securities and the Property Trustee shall have power to appoint, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved by the Property Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to act as separate trustee of any such Trust Property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If the Depositor does not join in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or in case an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section shall satisfy the requirements of Section 8.07. Should any written instrument from the Depositor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged, and delivered by the Depositor. Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely: (i) The Trust Securities shall be executed, authenticated and delivered and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustees hereunder, shall be exercised, solely by the Trustees. (ii) The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties, and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee. (iii) The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section, and, in case an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Depositor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section. (iv) No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee, or any other such trustee hereunder. (v) The Trustees shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee. (vi) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee. Section 8.10 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of any Trustee (the "Relevant Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Relevant Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. The Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Securityholders. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Relevant Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Relevant Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. Unless an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Relevant Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Holder of the Common Securities. If an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Relevant Trustee may be removed at such time by Act of the Securityholders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities Certificates, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust). If the Relevant Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of continuing to act as Trustee at a time when no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holder of the Common Securities, by Act of the Holder of the Common Securities delivered to the retiring Relevant Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and the retiring Relevant Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If the Relevant Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of continuing to act as the Relevant Trustee at a time when an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holders of Preferred Securities, by Act of the Securityholders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then outstanding delivered to the retiring Relevant Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and the Relevant Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed in accordance with this Section 8.10 and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Securityholder who has been a Securityholder of Trust Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. The retiring Relevant Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Relevant Trustee, and each appointment of a successor Trustee to all Securityholders in the manner provided in Section 10.08 and shall give notice to the Depositor. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, in the event any Administrative Trustee or a Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes incompetent or incapacitated or resigns, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity or resignation may be filled by (i) the act of the remaining Administrative Trustee or (ii) otherwise by the Depositor (with the successor in each case being an individual who satisfies the eligibility requirement for Administrative Trustees set forth in Section 8.07). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, in the event the Depositor believes that any Administrative Trustee has become incompetent or incapacitated, the Depositor, by notice to the remaining Trustees, may terminate the status of such Person as an Administrative Trustee (in which case the vacancy so created will be filled in accordance with the preceding sentence). Section 8.11 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, every such successor Relevant Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Trust and to the retiring Relevant Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective and such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but, on the request of the Depositor or the successor Relevant Trustee, such retiring Relevant Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Relevant Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder. Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the preceding paragraph. No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. Section 8.12 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any Person into which the Property Trustee, Delaware Trustee or any Administrative Trustee which is not a natural person may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. Section 8.13 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Trust. If and when the Property Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Depositor or the Trust (or any other obligor upon the Junior Subordinated Notes or the Trust Securities), the Property Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Depositor or Trust (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of the Trust Indenture Act: (a) "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and (b) "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Depositor or the Trust (or any such obligor) for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Property Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Depositor or the Trust (or any such obligor) arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation. Section 8.14 Reports by Property Trustee. --------------------------- (a) Within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with May 15, 2003, if required by Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall transmit a brief report dated as of such May 15 with respect to any of the events specified in such Section 313(a) that may have occurred since the later of the date of this Trust Agreement or the preceding May 15. (b) The Property Trustee shall transmit to Securityholders the reports required by Section 313(b) of the Trust Indenture Act at the times specified therein. (c) Reports pursuant to this Section shall be transmitted in the manner and to the Persons required by Sections 313(c) and (d) of the Trust Indenture Act. Section 8.15 Reports to the Property Trustee. The Depositor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such documents, reports and information as required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act (if any) and, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Depositor, the compliance certificate required by Section 314(a)(4) of the Trust Indenture Act in the form and in the manner required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act. Section 8.16 Evidence of Compliance with Conditions Precedent. Each of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such evidence of compliance with any conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Trust Agreement that relate to any of the matters set forth in Section 314(c) of the Trust Indenture Act. Any certificate or opinion required to be given pursuant to Section 314(c)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act shall comply with Section 314(e) of the Trust Indenture Act. Section 8.17 Number of Trustees. ------------------ (a) The number of Trustees shall initially be four, provided that the Depositor by written instrument may increase or decrease the number of Administrative Trustees. (b) If a Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason and the number of Administrative Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 8.17(a), or if the number of Trustees is increased pursuant to Section 8.17(a), a vacancy shall occur. The vacancy shall be filled with a Trustee appointed in accordance with Section 8.10. (c) The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of a Trustee shall not operate to annul the Trust. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Administrative Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled by the appointment of an Administrative Trustee in accordance with Section 8.10, the Administrative Trustees in office, regardless of their number (and notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement), shall have all powers granted to the Administrative Trustees and shall discharge the duties imposed upon the Administrative Trustees by this Trust Agreement. Section 8.18 Delegation of Power. ------------------- (a) Any Administrative Trustee may, by power of attorney consistent with applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 his or her power for the purpose of executing any documents contemplated in Section 2.07(A), including any registration statement or amendment thereto filed with the Commission, or making any other governmental filing; and (b) The Administrative Trustees shall have power to delegate from time to time to such of their number the doing of such things and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Administrative Trustees or otherwise as the Administrative Trustees may deem expedient, to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of the Trust, as set forth herein. Section 8.19 Enforcement of Rights of Property Trustee by Securityholders. If (i) the Trust fails to pay Distributions in full on the Preferred Securities for more than 20 consecutive quarterly distribution periods, or (ii) an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the Holders of Preferred Securities will rely on the enforcement by the Property Trustee of its rights against the Company and the Guarantor as the holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities will have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement, including the right to direct the Property Trustee to exercise the remedies available to it as a holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes, provided that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Trust Agreement, and could not involve the Property Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where reasonable indemnity would not be adequate. If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Junior Subordinated Notes, a Holder of Preferred Securities may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, institute a legal proceeding against the Company or the Guarantor or both to enforce its rights under this Trust Agreement without first instituting any legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other Person, including the Trust; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Trust Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Trust Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of Preferred Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Company or the Guarantor or both, without first instituting a legal proceeding against or requesting or directing that action be taken by the Property Trustee or any other Person, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of principal of or interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes having a principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of such Holder on or after the due dates therefor specified or provided for in the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Company or the Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders of Preferred Securities in respect of any amounts paid to such Holders by the Company or the Guarantor pursuant to this Section.

Section 9.04 Certificate of Cancellation. A Certificate of Cancellation ("Certificate") to terminate and dissolve the Trust (as permitted hereby) may be signed by any Administrative Trustee, individually, in such capacity so long as such Certificate fully complies with all legal requirements. Section 9.05 Liquidation. ----------- (a) If any Early Termination Event specified in clause (ii) of Section 9.02 occurs, the Trust shall be liquidated and the Property Trustee shall distribute the Junior Subordinated Notes to the Securityholders as provided in this Section 9.05. (b) In connection with a distribution of the Junior Subordinated Notes, each Holder of Trust Securities shall be entitled to receive, after the satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (as evidenced by a certificate of the Administrative Trustees), a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Notes. Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Trustees by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of liquidation shall: (i) state the Liquidation Date; (ii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Notes; and (iii) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Junior Subordinated Notes as the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee shall deem appropriate. (c) In order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the Junior Subordinated Notes to Securityholders, the Property Trustee shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Junior Subordinated Notes in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates. (d) After the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Notes will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such certificates to the Administrative Trustees or their agent for exchange, (iii) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Notes, accruing interest at the rate provided for in the Junior Subordinated Notes from the last Distribution Date on which a Distribution was made on such Trust Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Junior Subordinated Notes) and (iv) all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive Junior Subordinated Notes upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates. (e) The Depositor will use its best efforts to have the Junior Subordinated Notes that are distributed in exchange for the Preferred Securities to be listed on such securities exchange as the Preferred Securities are then listed. The Depositor may elect to have the Junior Subordinated Notes issued in book-entry form to the Clearing Agency or its nominee. Section 9.06 Bankruptcy. If an Early Termination Event specified in clause (i) of Section 9.02 has occurred, the Trust shall be liquidated. The Property Trustee shall distribute the Junior Subordinated Notes to the Securityholders as provided in Section 9.05, unless such distribution is determined by the Administrative Trustees not to be practical, in which event the Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Securityholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If such Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holder of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination pro rata (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Preferred Securities, except that, if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Preferred Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities.

Section 10.03 Amendment. --------- (a) This Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustees and the Depositor, without the consent of any Securityholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Trust Agreement, which shall not be inconsistent with the other provisions of this Trust Agreement, provided, however, that any such amendment shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Securityholder or (ii) to modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of this Trust Agreement to such extent as shall be necessary to ensure that the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes at any time that any Trust Securities are outstanding; provided, however, that, except in the case of clause (ii), such action shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Securityholder and, in the case of clause (i), any amendments of this Trust Agreement shall become effective when notice thereof is given to the Securityholders.

(c) In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, without the consent of each affected Securityholder (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.03 or 6.06 hereof), this Trust Agreement may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a specified date, (ii) restrict the right of a Securityholder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date, or (iii) change the consent required pursuant to Section 10.03. (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, the Trustees shall not enter into or consent to any amendment to this Trust Agreement which would cause the Trust to fail or cease to qualify for the exemption from status of an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, afforded by Rule 3a-5 thereunder. (e) Without the consent of the Depositor, this Trust Agreement may not be amended in a manner which imposes any additional obligation on the Depositor. In executing any amendment permitted by this Trust Agreement, the Trustees shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 8.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Trust Agreement. Any Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which affects such Trustee's own rights, duties, immunities or liabilities under this Trust Agreement or otherwise. (f) In the event that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is made, the Administrative Trustees shall promptly provide to the Depositor a copy of such amendment. Section 10.04 Separability.
