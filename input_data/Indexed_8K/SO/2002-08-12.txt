Item 5 Other Events. As reported in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 of The Southern Company ("Southern") filed on August 12, 2002, Mirant Corporation ("Mirant") recently announced that it is reviewing several accounting issues pertaining to its 2001 financial statements. These issues include potential overstatements of $85 million of gas inventory, $100 million of accounts payable and $68 million of accounts receivable. Mirant also has announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has initiated a related informal inquiry. If any issues require adjustments to Mirant's financial statements and relate to periods prior to April 2, 2001, Southern's earnings from discontinued operations and net assets of discontinued operations for such periods would be affected. Mirant's internal investigation and the SEC's inquiry into these issues have not yet been completed and the ultimate outcome cannot now be determined. However, any such issues would have no effect on Southern's 2002 earnings or its future earnings potential. Item 9 Regulation FD Disclosure.
