Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure. Reference is made to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditions - Future Earnings Potential" and to Note J to the "Notes to Financial Statements" in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 for Southern Company for information regarding power purchase agreements ("PPAs") between subsidiaries of Dynegy, Inc. ("Dynegy") and Mississippi Power Company ("Mississippi Power") and Southern Power Company ("Southern Power") and related letters of credit. On May 21, 2003, Mississippi Power and Southern Power entered into agreements with Dynegy (the "Agreements") to resolve all outstanding matters related to Dynegy, the PPAs, and the related letters of credit. Under the terms of the Agreements, (1) Dynegy made cash payments of $75 million to Mississippi Power and $80 million to Southern Power; (2) the PPAs between Southern Power and Dynegy were terminated effective as of 12:01 A.M., May 21, 2003, with no party having any remaining obligations under such PPAs thereafter; (3) Dynegy and Mississippi Power amended their PPA so that no capacity payments are due from Dynegy to Mississippi Power for capacity made available under the PPA from June 2003 through October 2003 (but other obligations and payments by Dynegy under the PPA would not be affected during such time) and the PPA would terminate effective October 31, 2003, with neither party having any remaining obligations under the PPA after October 31, 2003; (4) Dynegy paid all amounts for which it was obligated under the PPAs up to their time of cancellation or amendment; (5) Southern Power and Mississippi Power returned the existing letters of credit in support of Dynegy's obligations under the PPAs; and (6) Dynegy deposited $7 million with Mississippi Power as collateral for Dynegy's continuing obligations under the PPA. The termination payments from Dynegy will result in a one-time gain to Southern Company of approximately $88 million after tax. Mississippi Power will also recognize capacity revenues totaling approximately $8.8 million for the period from June through October. Under the original terms of the PPAs, Mississippi Power and Southern Power would have recognized revenue of approximately $1.8 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the remaining period of 2003 following the terminations. Because of the termination of these PPAs, Mississippi Power and Southern Power are exploring several options for their existing capacity and Southern Power is evaluating its construction schedule for Plant Franklin Unit 3 and may determine to defer or cancel further construction based on forecasted capacity needs or the absence of other wholesale opportunities. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.
