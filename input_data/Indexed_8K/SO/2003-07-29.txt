Exhibit 99.01 NEWS (LOGO) Media Contact: Marc Rice 404-506-5333 or 1-866-506-5333 MEDIA@SOUTHERNCOMPANY.COM WWW.SOUTHERNCOMPANY.COM Investor Relations Contact: Glen Kundert 404-506-5135 GAKUNDER2@SOUTHERNCO.COM July 29, 2003 Southern Company announces second quarter earnings ATLANTA - Southern Company today reported second quarter earnings of $432 million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $332 million, or 47 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2002. The 2003 results included a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million in May 2003 from the previously announced termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts between Southern Company and Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized for the remainder of the year had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 is $83 million, or 11 cents per share. Earnings for the first six months of 2003, including the gain from the Dynegy settlement, were $730 million, or $1.01 per share, compared with $556 million, or 79 cents per share, in the first six months a year ago. CEO Allen Franklin said mild weather during the spring reduced second quarter demand for electricity among retail customers. However, the corresponding availability of additional low-cost generation for the wholesale market boosted sales to other utilities and helped Southern Company's competitive generation business post a strong performance.
Continued customer growth also contributed positively to second quarter earnings. The influx of people and businesses into the region allowed Southern Company to serve 1.6 percent more customers than at the end of the second quarter a year ago. "Although the mild temperatures had a negative impact on our retail business during the second quarter, we achieved solid results from competitive generation and experienced other positive factors," Franklin said. "Overall, our company is performing very well, and we remain on track to meet our financial, operational and customer satisfaction targets for the year." Second quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first six months of 2003 were $5.4 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in the first six months of 2002. Reviewing operations, Franklin said electricity use by retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area decreased 2.1 percent during the second quarter, compared with the same period in 2002. In-home electricity needs decreased 4.1 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - decreased 1.3 percent. Industrial energy use decreased 1.1 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 3.0 percent in the second quarter. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its second quarter performance. These materials are available at 7:30 a.m. EDT July 29 at www.southerncompany.com. Southern Company's financial analyst call will be at 1 p.m. EDT July 29, at which time Franklin and Chief Financial Officer Tom Fanning will discuss earnings and earnings guidance and provide a general business update. Investors, media and the public may listen to a live Webcast of the call at www.southerncompany.com. A replay of the Webcast will be available at the site for 12 months.
