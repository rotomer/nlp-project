Exhibit 99.01 News {Company Logo} Media Contact: Marc Rice 404-506-5333 or 1-866-506-5333 media@southerncompany.com www.southerncompany.com Investor Relations Contact: Glen Kundert 404-506-5135 gakunder2@southernco.com Oct. 21, 2003 Despite unusually mild summer weather, Southern Company earnings increase in third quarter ATLANTA - Southern Company today reported third quarter earnings of $619 million, or 85 cents per share, compared with $595 million, or 84 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2002. Earnings for the first nine months of 2003 -- including a one-time item reported in the second quarter with a positive impact of 11 cents per share -- were $1.35 billion, or $1.86 per share. Earnings for the first nine months of 2002 were $1.15 billion, or $1.63 per share. The nine-month earnings for 2003 include a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million in the second quarter from the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts between Southern Company and Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized for the remainder of this year had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 is $83 million, or 11 cents per share. CEO Allen Franklin said continued mild weather during the summer reduced third quarter demand for electricity among retail customers. The impact on earnings from the weather-related decline in retail sales was offset by a number of positive factors, including the ongoing influx of people and businesses into the Southeast. Southern Company is serving 1.6 percent more customers now than at the end of the third quarter a year ago.
Successful efforts to control costs also contributed positively to earnings, as did stronger results from Southern Company's competitive generation business, in part because capacity from low-cost generation was available for sale in the wholesale market, Franklin added. "We remain focused on the fundamentals of running our business successfully for the long term," Franklin said. "We're operating our generating plants at record high levels of efficiency, continually upgrading our transmission and distribution system so that customers get their power safely and reliably, keeping prices low and building on our position as the industry leader in customer satisfaction." Third quarter revenues were $3.34 billion, compared with $3.25 billion in the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of 2003 were $8.75 billion, compared with $8.09 billion in the first nine months of 2002. Reviewing operations, Franklin said kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area decreased 1.4 percent during the third quarter, compared with the same period in 2002. In-home electricity needs, reflecting the unusually mild weather this summer, decreased 3.2 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 0.1 percent. Industrial energy use decreased 0.8 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 3.4 percent in the third quarter. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its second quarter performance. These materials are available at 7:30 a.m. EDT Oct. 21 at www.southerncompany.com. Southern Company's financial analyst call will be at 1 p.m. EDT Oct. 21, at which time Franklin and Chief Financial Officer Tom Fanning will discuss earnings and earnings guidance and provide a general business update.
