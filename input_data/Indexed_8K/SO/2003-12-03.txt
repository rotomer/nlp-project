Item 5. Other Events and Required FD Disclosure. Reference is made to Management's Discussion and Analysis - "Future Earnings Potential" in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 of each registrant for information regarding the formation of a Regional Transmission Organization ("RTO") as ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On December 2, 2003, the sponsors of the SeTrans RTO, including The Southern Company and the other registrants, issued a press release regarding their unanimous decision to suspend the SeTrans RTO effort due to the unlikelihood that consensus support and acceptance for the SeTrans RTO would be forthcoming from all applicable state and federal agencies. A copy of this release is being filed as Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined. Item 7.

Exhibit 99 For Immediate Release December 2, 2003 Statement of the SeTrans Sponsors Over two years ago, we began a process to voluntarily develop the SeTrans Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) with common goals: to address regional concerns about wholesale power markets in accordance with FERC's Order 2000; to produce net benefits for consumers in the Southeast; and to continue to provide the highly reliable electric service they have come to expect. We believe that FERC and retail regulators in the region share these general goals. Since the beginning of the process, several of the SeTrans Sponsors have been clear that their participation in SeTrans required the approval of applicable public service commissions under governing state laws, as well as the approval of the FERC. The retail commissions in the region have expressed significant concerns about the role of an RTO and its effects on matters subject to their jurisdiction, including concerns about native load protection and cost impacts. They have expressed these concerns in numerous public forums, letters to FERC and to Congress, and in SEARUC resolutions. In recent weeks, it has become increasingly apparent that most of the public service commissions continue to have these concerns. The jurisdictional Sponsors have now concluded that it is highly unlikely that consensus support and acceptance for the SeTrans RTO will be forthcoming from all applicable state and federal agencies. In light of this determination, the Sponsors have decided unanimously to suspend the SeTrans effort. While we are suspending our efforts, we believe that the SeTrans proposal contains much valuable work and could serve as an ultimate roadmap for future efforts in the region. Suspending our efforts on SeTrans will allow Sponsors to explore other alternatives that achieve the goals expressed above and also enhance the likelihood of receiving support at both the state and federal levels. ##### The SeTrans Sponsors are Cleco Power LLC, Dalton (GA) Utilities, Entergy Corporation, Georgia Transmission Corporation, JEA -- Jacksonville (FL), the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, Sam Rayburn G & T Electric Cooperative, Inc., Southern Company and the City of Tallahassee (FL).
