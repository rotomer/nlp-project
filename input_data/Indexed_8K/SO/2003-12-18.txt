Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure. On December 5, 2003, Mississippi Power Company ("Mississippi Power") filed a request with the Mississippi Public Service Commission ("MPSC") to modify certain provisions of its Performance Evaluation Plan and to reclassify as jurisdictional resources the 266 MW of leased capacity from Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 not currently included in the retail ratemaking process. As discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note N to the condensed financial statements in The Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, Mississippi Power previously had a long-term wholesale power contract with a subsidiary of Dynegy, Inc. This contract terminated effective October 31, 2003 and Mississippi Power recorded contract termination revenues of approximately $62.1 million. On December 16, 2003, the MPSC agreed to conduct an investigation to evaluate Mississippi Power's requests and, as requested by Mississippi Power, issued an interim accounting order directing Mississippi Power to establish a regulatory liability in the amount of approximately $60.3 million. Mississippi Power will record the related expense to recognize this regulatory liability in December 2003. Mississippi Power expects the MPSC to complete its evaluation and investigation and to issue a final order in these matters during the first half of 2004.
