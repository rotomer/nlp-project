Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. --------------------------------------------- The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. On January 29, 2004, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.01, Southern Company, in addition to presenting its earnings information in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), has also provided non-GAAP earnings data that reflect adjustments to exclude a one-time after-tax expense of $37 million, or 5 cents per share, associated with an interim state regulatory order in December 2003 related to the request of Mississippi Power Company ("Mississippi Power") to place additional capacity from Plant Daniel into retail rates and to exclude a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million, or 11 cents per share, in May 2003 associated with the termination of all long-term wholesale contracts between subsidiaries of Dynegy, Inc. and each of Mississippi Power and Southern Power Company ("Southern Power"). Southern Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because the items excluded are not indicative of Southern Company's continuing operating results and are excluded by Southern Company's management for planning and forecasting purposes. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Exhibits The exhibits hereto contain business segment information for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power, Savannah Electric and Power Company and Southern Power.

EXHIBIT 99.01 NEWS Media Contact: Marc Rice 404-506-5333 or 1-866-506-5333 MEDIA@SOUTHERNCOMPANY.COM WWW.SOUTHERNCOMPANY.COM Investor Relations Contact: Glen Kundert 404-506-5135 GAKUNDER2@SOUTHERNCO.COM Jan. 29, 2004 Southern Company reports earnings for fourth quarter, full-year 2003 ATLANTA - Southern Company today reported fourth quarter earnings of $125 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $167 million, or 23 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. The fourth quarter results included a one-time after-tax expense of $37 million, or 5 cents a share, associated with an interim state regulatory order in December related to Mississippi Power's request to place additional capacity from Plant Daniel into retail rates. This one-time expense substantially offsets a one-time gain realized earlier in the year by Mississippi Power in connection with Southern Company's settlement of a power sales contract with Dynegy, Inc. Excluding the one-time expense, the adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $162 million, or 22 cents a share. Mild weather in the fourth quarter, compared with unusually cold weather in the same period a year earlier, reduced electricity sales to residential customers. However, continued customer growth during the quarter partially offset the weather's impact on earnings.
Reported full-year earnings for 2003 were $1.47 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with earnings of $1.32 billion, or $1.86 per share, in 2002. As previously reported, Southern Company's results for the second quarter of 2003 included a one-time after-tax gain of 11 cents per share from the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts between Southern Company and Dynegy, Inc. The net impact of both this one-time gain and the one-time expense in the fourth quarter related to the Mississippi regulatory order was positive 6 cents per share for the year. Excluding these one-time items, earnings for 2003 were $1.43 billion, or $1.97 per share. The Southeast remained a draw for people and businesses throughout the year, and the number of customers served by Southern Company increased by 68,000, or 1.7 percent, during 2003. CEO Allen Franklin said Southern Company's business units performed well overall in 2003, operating at historically high levels of reliability, achieving industry-leading customer satisfaction levels and continuing to offer retail prices below the national average. "Southern Company people did an outstanding job in 2003 to meet or exceed our financial, operational and customer service goals," Franklin said. "Our commitment to deliver good results for customers and shareholders remains strong in 2004." Revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.56 billion, compared with $2.46 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4.4 percent. Revenues for the full year were $11.28 billion, compared with $10.55 billion in 2002, up 6.9 percent. Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area decreased 0.2 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Residential electricity use decreased 1.9 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 0.3 percent. Industrial energy use increased 1.0 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 4.2 percent in 2003, compared with the previous year. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its fourth quarter and full-year 2003 performance.
