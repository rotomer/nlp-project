The solid performance was marked by continued customer growth, increased residential energy use and, primarily in Alabama, an ongoing rebound and expansion in demand for electricity in the industrial sector. The earnings compared with $298 million, or 41 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2003. With its business focused in the Southeast, one of the nation's fastest-growing regions, Southern Company is serving an increasing number of customers. Total customers increased by 71,000, or 1.7 percent, since March 2003. Meanwhile, year-to-year electricity sales to industrial customers rose for the second consecutive quarter following an extended downturn. Renewed strength, especially in Alabama's steel and automobile sectors, contributed to a 5 percent increase in industrial energy use, compared with the first quarter a year ago. "We were encouraged by the growth in our overall customer base and the economic trends reflected in the improved industrial sales. Most important, our people responded by reliably serving the increased demand for energy in the first quarter," said CEO Allen Franklin. "Our commitment to successfully execute our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value and customer satisfaction remains strong," Franklin added.
Revenues for the first quarter were $2.75 billion, compared with $2.55 billion in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 8.1 percent. Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 4.5 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2003. Residential electricity use increased 5.3 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 3.4 percent. Industrial energy use increased 5.0 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 3.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the first quarter last year. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its first quarter performance.
