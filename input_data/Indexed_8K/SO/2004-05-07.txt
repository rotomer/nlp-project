Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure. ----------------------------------------- For information regarding the construction of Plant McIntosh combined cycle units 10 and 11 by Southern Power Company (Southern Power), Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC) certification of purchased power agreements between Southern Power and Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) and Savannah Electric and Power Company (Savannah Electric) for the Plant McIntosh unit 10 and 11 capacity beginning June 2005 (the McIntosh PPAs), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval process for the McIntosh PPAs, see Item 7-- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential -- FERC Matters" of The Southern Company (Southern Company), Georgia Power and Southern Power under "Market-Based Rate Authority" and of Savannah Electric under "Southern Power PPA" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power, Savannah Electric and Southern Power under "FERC Matters" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential -- FERC Matters" and Note (C) to the Condensed Financial Statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power, Savannah Electric and Southern Power in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. To ensure the timely completion of construction on McIntosh units 10 and 11 and their availability in the summer of 2005 as supply side resources for the retail customers in the State of Georgia, on May 7, 2004, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric requested the GPSC to direct them to purchase the McIntosh combined cycle units 10 and 11 construction project from Southern Power. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric propose to place the units in rate base at a cost approved by the GPSC and to recover the unit operation and maintenance costs as retail service expenses as may be approved by the GPSC. Georgia Power and Savannah Electric propose to complete the purchase within 30 days. After the project is purchased by Georgia Power and Savannah Electric, the McIntosh PPAs would no longer be effective. Therefore, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric propose to file an application within 10 days of completing the purchase to amend the resource certificate granted by the GPSC in 2002 to describe the capacity resource as being the McIntosh units 10 and 11 (as opposed to the McIntosh PPAs), the approximate construction schedule (which is not expected to change) and the proposed ratebase treatment. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.
