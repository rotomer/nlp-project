On July 1, 2004, Georgia Power Company ("Georgia Power") filed a request with the Georgia Public Service Commission ("GPSC") for an approximate 7 percent increase in retail revenues, effective January 1, 2005. The requested increase is based on a future test year ending July 31, 2005 and a proposed retail return on common equity of 12.5 percent. In January 2002, Georgia Power began operating under a three-year retail rate order that expires December 31, 2004. Under the terms of the existing order, earnings are evaluated annually against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent. Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return are applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. The order required Georgia Power to file a general rate case on July 1, 2004, in response to which the GPSC would be expected to determine whether the rate order should be continued, modified or discontinued. See Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis - "Future Earnings Potential - Other Matters" of The Southern Company ("Southern") and of Georgia Power and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern under "Georgia Power Retail Rate Orders" and of Georgia Power under "Retail Rate Orders" in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 for additional information. The increase in retail revenues is being requested to cover the higher costs of purchased power; operating and maintenance expenses; environmental compliance; and continued investment in new generation, transmission and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. Georgia Power expects to spend more than $5 billion over the next five years in capital expenditures. Georgia Power expects the GPSC to issue a final order in this matter during December 2004. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.
