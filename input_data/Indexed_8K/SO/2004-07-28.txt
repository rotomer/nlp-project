Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2004 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.01, Southern Company, in addition to presenting its earnings information in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), has also provided non-GAAP earnings data for the second quarter 2003 and year-to-date 2003 to exclude a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million related to the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts with Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized in 2003 had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 was $83 million, or 11 cents per share.

The results compared with earnings - excluding a one-time gain in 2003 - of $349 million, or 49 cents per share, in the second quarter a year ago. The 2003 results included a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million related to the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts with Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized in 2003 had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 was $83 million, or 11 cents per share. Including the impact of the Dynegy settlement, reported earnings for the second quarter of 2003 were $432 million, or 60 cents per share. Earnings for the first six months of this year were $683 million, or 93 cents per share, compared with earnings - excluding the gain from ending the Dynegy contracts - of $647 million, or 90 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Including the gain from the Dynegy settlement, earnings for the first six months of 2003 were $730 million, or $1.01 per share. Warmer weather in the second quarter, compared with last year, helped boost demand for electricity and contributed positively to earnings. Temperatures in this year's second quarter were slightly above normal, while mild weather in the second quarter last year had reduced demand by retail customers.
Continued customer growth of 1.8 percent also contributed positively to second quarter earnings. Southern Company served 4.2 million customers as of June 30, compared with 4.1 million a year ago. These positive earnings drivers were offset in part by increased expenses. These related primarily to the timing of operations and maintenance costs, as some maintenance projects, not completed in 2003 and earlier this year, were performed in the second quarter of 2004. "Our businesses continued to perform well overall in the second quarter, giving us solid results and keeping the company on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals for the year," said David M. Ratcliffe, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We remain committed to the strategy that has rewarded investors and provided our customers reliable, affordable energy with outstanding service," Ratcliffe added, noting that during the second quarter it was announced that Southern Company had, for the fifth straight year, been rated highest in customer satisfaction in the American Customer Satisfaction Index survey of residential customers representing 29 U.S. utilities. Second quarter revenues were $3.01 billion, compared with $2.82 billion in the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first six months of this year were $5.74 billion, compared with $5.36 billion in the first half of 2003. Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 5.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with the same period in 2003. Residential electricity use increased 8.5 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 5.1 percent. Industrial energy use increased 3.0 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 4.6 percent, compared with the second quarter last year. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its second quarter performance. These materials are available at 7:30 a.m. EDT July 28 at www.southerncompany.com.
