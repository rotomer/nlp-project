Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure. On August 2, 2004, Alabama Power Company made a filing with the Alabama Public Service Commission to establish a specific rate mechanism for the recovery of retail costs associated with environmental laws, regulations or other such mandates. If approved, the rate mechanism would begin operation in January 2005 and provide for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that will be calculated annually. It is anticipated that for the first two years of the increase, retail rates would increase under the proposed mechanism by approximately 1% ($33 million) in 2005 and approximately an additional 1% ($30 million) in 2006. Such environmental cost recovery would include operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and a return on invested capital. The outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.
