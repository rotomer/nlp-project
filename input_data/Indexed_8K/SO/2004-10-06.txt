Other Events. ------------ In the proceeding filed by Alabama Power Company ("Alabama Power") to establish a rate mechanism for the recovery of retail costs associated with environmental laws and regulations, described in the Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 2, 2004, the Alabama Public Service Commission ("Alabama PSC"), on October 5, 2004, voted to approve the rate mechanism as filed, to begin operation in January 2005. In conjunction with the Alabama PSC's approval, Alabama Power agreed to a moratorium until March 2007 on any retail rate increase under the previously approved Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan. Any increase in March 2007 would be based upon the earned return on retail common equity at December 31, 2006. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power and The Southern Company under "Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures" and "Alabama Power Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures," respectively, in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 for further information on the Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan.
