Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. --------------------------------------------- The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. On October 21, 2004, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the periods ended September 30, 2004. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2004 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.01, Southern Company, in addition to presenting its earnings information in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), has also provided non-GAAP earnings data for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 to exclude a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million related to the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts with Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized in 2003 had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 was $83 million, or 11 cents per share. Including the impact of the Dynegy settlement, reported earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 were $1.35 billion, or $1.86 per share. Southern Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because the item excluded is not indicative of Southern Company's continuing operating results and is excluded by Southern Company's management for planning and forecasting purposes. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Exhibits The exhibits hereto contain business segment information for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company and Southern Power Company.

Exhibit 99.01 News [LOGO} Media Contact: Marc Rice 404-506-5333 or 1-866-506-5333 media@southerncompany.com www.southerncompany.com Investor Relations Contact: Glen Kundert 404-506-5135 gakunder2@southernco.com Oct. 21, 2004 Southern Company third quarter earnings meet expectations as increased industrial sales, customer growth continue ATLANTA - Southern Company today said its third quarter earnings were $644.5 million, or 87 cents per share, meeting expectations. The results compared with earnings of $618.8 million, or 85 cents per share, in the third quarter a year ago. Earnings for the first nine months of 2004 were $1.33 billion, or $1.80 per share. The nine-month results compared with earnings - excluding a one-time gain in 2003 - of $1.27 billion, or $1.75 per share in the same period a year ago. The results for the first nine months of 2003 included a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million related to the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts with Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized in 2003 had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 was $83 million, or 11 cents per share. Including the impact of the Dynegy settlement, reported earnings for the first nine months of 2003 were $1.35 billion, or $1.86 per share. The solid earnings in the third quarter were achieved despite mild weather in the Southeast and extensive infrastructure damage, especially in northwest Florida and southwest Alabama, caused in September by Hurricane Ivan, the most destructive storm in the company's history.
At its peak, Ivan left 1.6 million customers - nearly 40 percent of Southern Company's total customer base - without power. However, electric service was restored within a week to 94 percent of customers, and within two weeks to all customers who were able to accept power. "Superior performance by Southern Company people and their commitment to serving customers were on full display as we dealt with this terrible storm," said David M. Ratcliffe, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "From getting workers on site to securing huge amounts of equipment, our ability to respond quickly and efficiently helped millions of people cope with the storm's devastation and also helped minimize the financial impact on the company." The third quarter saw mild weather across Southern Company's four-state service area, including the second-coolest August temperatures in 25 years. The impact on earnings from the cooler-than-normal summer weather was offset in part by increased energy use in the industrial sector, reflecting ongoing economic progress - most notably in the automotive, steel and chemical industries in Alabama - that began late last year and continued in the third quarter. Another primary factor contributing positively to earnings was continued customer growth. Southern Company served about 70,000 more customers as of Sept. 30 than it did at the same time a year earlier, an increase of 1.7 percent. "By successfully executing our conservative strategy centered on long-term performance, we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter," Ratcliffe said. Third quarter revenues were $3.44 billion, compared with $3.30 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4.2 percent. Revenues for the first nine months of this year were $9.18 billion, compared with $8.67 billion in the same period of 2003, an increase of 6.0 percent. Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 0.8 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same period in 2003. Residential electricity use declined 0.9 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 0.8 percent. Industrial energy use increased 2.7 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, decreased 2.7 percent, compared with the third quarter last year. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its third quarter performance.
