Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. --------------------------------------------- The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. On January 25, 2005, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.01, Southern Company, in addition to presenting its earnings information in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), has also provided non-GAAP earnings data for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The non-GAAP earnings data for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 reflects an adjustment to exclude a one-time gain related to the resolution of an IRS audit for the years 2000 and 2001, which had the net effect of increasing earnings by $24 million, or 3 cents per share. The non-GAAP earnings data for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 reflects an adjustment to exclude a one-time after-tax expense of $37 million, or 5 cents per share, associated with an interim state regulatory order in December 2003 related to the request of Mississippi Power Company to place additional capacity from Plant Daniel into retail rates. In addition, the non-GAAP earnings data for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflects an adjustment to exclude a one-time after-tax gain of $83 million in May 2003, or 11 cents per share, related to the termination of all long-term wholesale contracts with Dynegy, Inc. as adjusted for revenues that would have been recognized for the remainder of the year. Southern Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because the items excluded are not indicative of Southern Company's continuing operating results and are excluded by Southern Company's management for planning and forecasting purposes. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Exhibits The exhibits hereto contain business segment information for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company and Southern Power Company. Accordingly, this report is also being furnished on behalf of each such registrant.

For the full year, Southern Company reported earnings of $1.53 billion, or $2.07 per share, compared with reported earnings of $1.47 billion, or 2.03 per share, in 2003. The company's earnings target for 2004 was in a range of $1.94 and $1.99 per share. Continued economic vitality in the Southeast helped boost electricity sales and was a key contributor to the fourth quarter and full-year results, which exceeded analysts' expectations. Businesses and individuals continued to be drawn to the Southeast, boosting the number of customers Southern Company serves by 61,342, or 1.5 percent, in 2004. "We are pleased with the excellent results we achieved in 2004," said Chairman, President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe. "Our people delivered another outstanding performance by continuing to focus on the fundamentals of giving customers reliable power, low prices and great service."
The 2004 earnings included one-time items in the fourth quarter related to the resolution of an Internal Revenue Service audit for the years 2000 and 2001, which had the net effect of increasing earnings by $24 million, or 3 cents per share. Excluding the impact of these items, fourth quarter earnings were $180.4 million, or 24 cents a share. Earnings for the full year, excluding the one-time items, were $1.51 billion, or $2.04 per share. The 2003 earnings for the fourth quarter included a one-time after-tax expense related to a regulatory order in Mississippi which reduced earnings for that period by $37 million, or 5 cents a share. Excluding the impact of that one-time item, earnings for the fourth quarter a year ago were $162.3 million, or 22 cents a share. The full-year results for 2003 also included a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million related to the termination of all long-term wholesale power contracts with Dynegy, Inc. After adjusting for revenues that would have been recognized in 2003 had the contracts remained in place, the adjusted gain for 2003 was $83 million, or 11 cents per share. Excluding the impact of the Dynegy settlement and the Mississippi regulatory order, full-year earnings for 2003 were $1.43 billion, or $1.97 per share. The fourth quarter saw a continuation of the economic rebound that helped boost electricity sales, most notably among large industrial customers, throughout 2004. Particularly strong growth in demand for electricity was seen during the fourth quarter in the building materials, carpet, automobile equipment, steel and paper industries. The strong results for 2004 were achieved despite the extensive damage and economic disruption in Florida and Alabama caused by Hurricane Ivan in September. "Because of the outstanding response by Southern Company employees, with assistance from many other companies and organizations, we were able to restore service to our customers in record time and withstand the most severe storm ever to hit our service territory," Ratcliffe said. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.72 billion, compared with $2.52 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 8.0 percent. Revenues for the full year were $11.90 billion, compared with $11.19 billion in 2003, up 6.4 percent. Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 3.6 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. Residential electricity use increased 3.9 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 3.4 percent. Industrial energy use increased 3.6 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 0.1 percent in 2004, compared with the previous year.
