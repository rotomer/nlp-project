Item 8.01. Other Events. For information on Georgia Power Company's ("Georgia Power") current fuel cost recovery rate, see Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL - "FERC and State PSC Matters - Retail Fuel Cost Recovery" and - "FERC and Georgia PSC Matters - Retail Fuel Cost Recovery," respectively, in The Southern Company's and Georgia Power's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 for information on actual recent fuel costs. On February 18, 2005, Georgia Power will file a request with the Georgia Public Service Commission ("PSC") for a fuel cost recovery rate increase. In the ordinary course, these new rates will be effective June 1, 2005 following a hearing before and approval by the Georgia PSC. In its filing, Georgia Power will ask that the Georgia PSC accept the new rate, effective April 1, 2005, prior to a formal hearing on Georgia Power's request. This action, if taken by the Georgia PSC, would serve to mitigate expected increases in the under recovered balance during April and May, but will not preclude the Georgia PSC from subsequently adjusting the rates. The requested increase, representing an annual increase in revenues of approximately 11.7%, will allow for the recovery of fuel costs based on an estimate of future fuel costs, as well as the collection of the existing under recovery of fuel costs. Georgia Power's under recovered fuel costs as of January 31, 2005 totaled $390 million. A final decision from the Georgia PSC is expected in May 2005. The final outcome of the filing cannot be determined at this time.
