Exhibit 99.01 News Media Contact: Marc Rice 404-506-5333 or 1-866-506-5333 media@southerncompany.com www.southerncompany.com Investor Relations Contact: Glen Kundert 404-506-5135 gakunder2@southernco.com April 26, 2005 Southern Company reports first quarter earnings ATLANTA - Southern Company today reported first quarter earnings of $323.0 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $331.1 million, or 45 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. The company said that several factors contributing positively to earnings -- including continued customer growth, sustained economic strength in the Southeast and the overall impact of regulatory actions in Georgia that took effect in the first quarter -- were offset in part by mild weather, which reduced residential demand for electricity, and also by increased operations and maintenance costs. Chairman, President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe said the first quarter earnings, which exceeded analysts' estimates, were boosted by the continued economic health of the Southeast and the region's attractiveness to new residents and businesses. "The fundamentals of our business remain strong," Ratcliffe said. "I believe we will meet our financial, operational and customer satisfaction targets for the year." Revenues for the first quarter were $2.86 billion, compared with $2.73 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4.8 percent.
Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area decreased 0.8 percent in the first quarter, compared with 2004. Residential electricity use decreased 3.5 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers - -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 0.9 percent. Industrial energy use increased 0.1 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, decreased 0.6 percent in the first quarter, compared with the previous year. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its first quarter performance. These materials are available at 7:30 a.m. EDT April 26 at www.southerncompany.com. Southern Company's financial analyst call will be at 1 p.m. EDT April 26, at which time Ratcliffe and Chief Financial Officer Tom Fanning will discuss earnings and earnings guidance as well as a general business update. Investors, media and the public may listen to a live Webcast of the call at www.southerncompany.com. A replay of the Webcast will be available at the site for 12 months.
