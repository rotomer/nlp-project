Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. On July 26, 2005, The Southern Company issued a press release regarding its earnings for the periods ended June 30, 2005. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In exhibits 99.01 and 99.02 attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K, Southern Company, in addition to presenting kilowatt-hour sales information for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2004, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), has also provided adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2004. In 2005, certain Georgia Power Company industrial customers were reclassified from industrial to commercial to be consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. The adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information reclassifies 2004 kilowatt-hour sales for commercial and industrial customers to be consistent with the presentation for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005. Southern Company believes that the adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information is useful to investors because it provides investors with more consistent information for purposes of comparing 2004 and 2005 kilowatt-hour sales performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Exhibits The exhibits hereto contain business segment information for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company and Southern Power Company.

Exhibit 99.01 News [Southern Company Logo] Contacts: Media: Marc Rice 404-506-5333 or 1-866-506-5333 media@southerncompany.com www.southerncompany.com Investors: Glen Kundert, 404-506-5135 July 26, 2005 Southern Company reports solid second quarter performance ATLANTA - Southern Company today reported second quarter earnings of $387 million, or 52 cents per share. The results compared with earnings of $352 million, or 48 cents per share, in the second quarter a year ago. Earnings for the first six months of this year were $710 million, or 95 cents per share, compared with earnings of $683 million, or 93 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Factors contributing positively to the earnings include continued economic strength in the Southeast and customer growth, especially residential and commercial. Offsetting the positive impacts was the weather, which was extremely mild throughout the second quarter of 2005, with above average rainfall and moderate temperatures. "Our continued focus on execution of business plans, along with a strong economy in the Southeast, contributed to a successful second quarter," said Chairman, President and CEO David Ratcliffe. "Our performance was strong despite rising oil and energy prices, and the second-mildest second-quarter weather we've seen in our service territory in 15 years." Second quarter revenues were $3.14 billion, compared with $3.01 billion in the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first six months of this year were $6.01 billion, compared with $5.74 billion in the first half of 2004. In 2005, some Georgia Power industrial customers were reclassified from the industrial class to the commercial class to be consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Adjusting the 2004
numbers for comparison purposes, kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area decreased 1.8 percent in the second quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 2004. Residential electricity use decreased 5.2 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers - -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - decreased 0.9 percent. Industrial energy use increased 0.2 percent. As reported, without adjusting the 2004 kilowatt-hour sales, commercial sales for the second quarter of this year are up 1.6 percent and industrial energy sales are down 2.0 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, decreased 1.8 percent, compared with the second quarter last year. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its second quarter performance.
