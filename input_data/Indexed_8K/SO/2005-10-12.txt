Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement On October 10, 2005, the Compensation and Management Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of The Southern Company ("Southern Company") modified the terms of certain cash-based awards previously granted in February 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 to approximately 6,000 active and retired employees, as eligible participants in the Southern Company Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. Eligible participants include executive officers of Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company and Savannah Electric and Power Company. The cash-based awards provide for the payment of performance-based dividend equivalents on stock options held by eligible participants, with the amount of payment based on Southern Company's total shareholder return ranking in a utility peer group over four-year performance periods ending December 31, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. For each of these performance periods, the dividend equivalents were to range from 25 percent of Southern Company's common stock dividend paid during the last year of the performance period if Southern Company's total shareholder return ranking over the performance period was at the 30th percentile of the group, to 100 percent of such dividend paid if Southern Company's total shareholder return ranking reaches the 90th percentile. The Committee modified the terms of the awards to provide for payment of dividend equivalents ranging from approximately five percent of such dividend paid if Southern Company's total shareholder return ranking over the performance period is in the first position above the 10th percentile to 100 percent of such
dividend paid if Southern Company's total shareholder return ranking reaches the 90th percentile. No dividend equivalents will be paid if the total shareholder return ranking over the period is at or below the 10th percentile or if Southern Company's earnings are not sufficient to fund the current common stock dividend. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each of the registrants has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
