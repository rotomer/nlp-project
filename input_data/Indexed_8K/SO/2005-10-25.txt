Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. On October 25, 2005, The Southern Company issued a press release regarding its earnings for the periods ended September 30, 2005. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In exhibits 99.01 and 99.05 attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K, Southern Company, in addition to presenting kilowatt-hour sales information for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2004, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), has also provided adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2004. In 2005, certain Georgia Power Company industrial customers were reclassified from industrial to commercial to be consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. The adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information reclassifies 2004 kilowatt-hour sales for commercial and industrial customers to be consistent with the presentation for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005. Southern Company believes that the adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information is useful to investors because it provides investors with more consistent information for purposes of comparing 2004 and 2005 kilowatt-hour sales performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Exhibits The exhibits hereto contain business segment information for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company and Southern Power Company.

Exhibit 99.01 News {Southern Company Logo} Media Contact: Marc Rice 404-506-5333 or 1-866-506-5333 media@southerncompany.com www.southerncompany.com Investor Relations Contact: Glen Kundert 404-506-5135 gakunder2@southernco.com Oct. 25, 2005 Southern Company reports solid earnings for third quarter ATLANTA - Unseasonably warm weather in September along with sustained economic strength in the Southeast helped Southern Company to deliver solid earnings in the third quarter. The company reported third quarter earnings of $722.2 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with $644.5 million, or 87 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. For the first nine months of this year, earnings were $1.43 billion, or $1.92 per share, compared with $1.33 billion, or $1.80 per share, in the same period of 2004. Compared with extremely mild weather in the third quarter last year, the weather was normal for most of the 2005 third quarter, then hotter than normal in September -- the warmest temperatures for that month in a quarter-century -- which led to greater usage of electricity by Southern Company customers overall. Additionally, the regional economy remained relatively strong, and the number of customers served by Southern Company and its subsidiaries continued to grow, totaling more than 4.2 million at the end of the third quarter.
Southern Company's Mississippi Power and Alabama Power subsidiaries were hit hard by Hurricane Katrina during the third quarter. All 195,000 of Mississippi Power's customers and nearly 637,000 of Alabama Power's - about 49 percent - lost electric service in the wake of the storm. In terms of physical damage, it was the worst storm ever faced by Mississippi Power. Historically, the uninsured costs of repairing hurricane damage have been recovered through regulatory action, and Mississippi Power and Alabama Power have begun the process of working with their state Public Service Commissions to seek recovery of those costs. "I am proud of the way our people continue to meet our financial, operational and customer satisfaction targets, as evidenced by our strong performance in the third quarter," said David M. Ratcliffe, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Just as important as the numbers on a financial statement is how a company responds when it is tested, as we have been by three major hurricanes in the past year." Ratcliffe added. "In that regard, the actions of our people to restore power - it was back on for all customers who could receive it within 12 days - as well as to help the coastal area otherwise get back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina have been nothing short of outstanding." Third quarter revenues were $4.38 billion, compared with $3.44 billion in the third quarter a year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of the year were $10.39 billion, compared with $9.18 billion in the same period last year. Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 5.6 percent in the third quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 2004. Residential electricity use increased 11.4 percent, primarily because of the warmer weather. In 2005, some Georgia Power industrial customers were reclassified from the industrial class to the commercial class to be consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Adjusting the 2004 numbers for comparison purposes, electricity use by commercial customers -- offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms - increased 6.4 percent, also mainly because of the weather. Industrial energy use decreased 1.1 percent. As reported, without adjusting the 2004 kilowatt-hour sales, commercial sales for the third quarter of this year are up 8.5 percent and industrial energy sales are down 3.0 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 8.2 percent, compared with the third quarter last year. In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its third quarter performance. These materials are available at 7:30 a.m. EDT Oct. 25 at www.southerncompany.com. Southern Company's financial analyst call will be at 1 p.m. EDT Oct. 25, at which time Ratcliffe and Chief Financial Officer Tom Fanning will discuss earnings and earnings guidance as well as a general business update.
