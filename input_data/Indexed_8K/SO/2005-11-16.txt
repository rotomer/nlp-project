The selected financial data and the summary financial information included in the Final Supplemented Prospectus present fairly the information shown therein and have been compiled on a basis consistent with that of the audited and unaudited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
(a)      On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, SoCo Capital agrees to sell to each Underwriter severally and not jointly, and each Underwriter severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from SoCo Capital, the principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule I to this Agreement opposite the name of such Underwriter, plus any additional amount of Notes that such Underwriter may become obligated to purchase pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 hereof, at a price equal to 99.350% of the principal amount thereof.

It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representative, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for and make payment of the principal amount of the Notes which each Underwriter has agreed to purchase. The Representative, individually and not as a representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased by any Underwriter whose payment has not been received by the Closing Date, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.
The delivery of the Notes shall be made in fully registered form, registered in the name of CEDE & CO., to the offices of The Depository Trust Company in New York, New York or its designee, and the Representative shall accept such delivery.

As soon as the Company is advised thereof, it will advise the Representative orally of the issuance of any stop order under the Securities Act with respect to the Registration Statement, or the institution of any proceedings therefor, of which the Company shall have received notice, and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to secure the prompt removal thereof, if issued. The Offerors will deliver to the Underwriters sufficient conformed copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus and of all supplements and amendments thereto (in each case without exhibits) for distribution to each Underwriter and, from time to time, as many copies of the Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
(b)      The Offerors will furnish the Underwriters with copies of each amendment and supplement to the Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus relating to the offering of the Notes in such quantities as the Underwriters may from time to time reasonably request. If, during the period (not exceeding nine months) when the delivery of a prospectus shall be required by law in connection with the sale of any Notes by an Underwriter or dealer, any event relating to or affecting the Company, or of which the Company shall be advised in writing by the Representative, shall occur, which in the opinion of the Company or of Underwriters' counsel should be set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Final Supplemented Prospectus in order to make the Final Supplemented Prospectus not misleading in the light of the circumstances when it is delivered, or if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such period to amend or supplement the Final Supplemented Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Company forthwith will (i) notify the Underwriters to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Notes and (ii) at its expense, make any such filing or prepare and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or supplements or an amendment or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus which will supplement or amend the Final Supplemented Prospectus so that, as supplemented or amended, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Final Supplemented Prospectus is delivered, not misleading or which will effect any other necessary
 
7
 
 
compliance. In case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus in connection with the sale of any Notes after the expiration of the period specified in the preceding sentence, the Company, upon the request of such Underwriter, will furnish to such Underwriter, at the expense of such Underwriter, a reasonable quantity of a supplemented or amended prospectus, or supplements or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus, complying with Section 10(a) of the Securities Act. During the period specified in the second sentence of this subsection, the Company will continue to prepare and file with the Commission on a timely basis all documents or amendments required under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

provided
,
however
, that neither of the Offerors shall be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to file a consent to service of process or to file annual reports or to comply with any other requirements in connection with such qualification deemed by the Company to be unduly burdensome.
(d)      The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable but not later than 45 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement of the Company (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the rules and regulations under the Securities Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
(e)      During a period of 15 days from the date of this Agreement, neither SoCo Capital nor the Company will, without the Representative's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any Notes, any security convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for the Notes or any debt securities substantially similar to the Notes (except for the Notes issued pursuant to this Agreement. The Representative agrees that commercial paper or other debt securities with scheduled maturities of less than one year are not subject to this Section 3(e).
(f)      As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within the time prescribed by Rule 424 under the Securities Act, the Company will file the Final Supplemented Prospectus with the Commission and will advise the Representative of such filing and will confirm such advice in writing.

(3)      The opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule IV.
(d)      At the Closing Date, there shall not have been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, any material adverse change in the business, properties or financial condition of the Offerors, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Representative shall have received a certificate of the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President of the Company and SoCo Capital, and dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 1 hereof are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date, (iii) the Offerors have complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on their respective parts to be performed or satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date, and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission.
(e)      On the Closing Date, the Representative shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP, a letter dated the Closing Date to the effect that: (A) they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations under the Securities Act; (B) in their opinion, the financial statements audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act; and (C) on the basis of certain limited procedures performed through a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of such letter, namely (i) reading the minute books of the Company; (ii) performing the procedures specified by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") for a review of interim financial statement information as described in SAS 100, "Interim Financial Information", on the unaudited financial statements, if any, of the Company incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus and on the latest available unaudited financial statements of the Company, if any, for any calendar quarter subsequent to the date of those incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus; and (iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding such unaudited financial statements or any specified unaudited amounts derived therefrom (it being understood that the foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit performed in
 
10
 
 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments made in such letter, and accordingly that Deloitte & Touche LLP make no representations as to the sufficiency of such procedures for the Underwriters' purposes), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (1) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; (2) such unaudited condensed financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; (3) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and the unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges set forth in the Final Supplemented Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (4) as of a specified date not more than five business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there has been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any decrease in net assets as compared with amounts shown in the latest unaudited balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus, except in each case for changes or decreases which (i) the Final Supplemented Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs under existing pollution control financing arrangements, (iv) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (v) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, (vi) are occasioned by the reclassification of current maturities of long-term debt, or (vii) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and the unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which, if available, shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding audited amounts or ratios included or incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
(f)      On the Closing Date, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Notes as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Offerors, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representative and Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.
(g)      No amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Final Supplemented Prospectus filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement (including
 
11
 
 
any filing made by the Company pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act) shall be unsatisfactory in form to Dewey Ballantine LLP or shall contain information (other than with respect to an amendment or supplement relating solely to the activity of any Underwriter or Underwriters) which, in the reasonable judgment of the Representative, shall materially impair the marketability of the Notes.
(h)      The Offerors shall have performed their respective obligations when and as provided under this Agreement.
If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative by notice to the Offerors at any time prior to the Closing Date, and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4, 7 and 9(b) hereof.
SECTION 6. 
CONDITIONS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE OFFERORS
. The obligations of the Offerors shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 5(a) and in Section 5(b). In case such conditions shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company by mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Representative. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 4, 7 and 9(b) hereof.
(a)      The Offerors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, and to reimburse any such Underwriter and such controlling person or persons, if any, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or if the Offerors shall furnish to the Underwriters any amendments or any supplements thereto, or shall make any filings pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the Exchange Act which are incorporated therein by reference, in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission which was made in such Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus, Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or through the Representative on
 
12
 
 
behalf of any Underwriter for use therein and except that this indemnity with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, if the Offerors shall have furnished any amendment or supplement thereto, shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or of any person controlling such Underwriter) on account of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arising from the sale of the Notes to any person if a copy of the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus (exclusive of documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3), as the same may then be amended or supplemented, shall not have been sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person with or prior to the written confirmation of the sale involved and the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was corrected in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus as supplemented or amended at the time of such confirmation. Each Underwriter agrees, within ten days after the receipt by it of notice of the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought by it, or by any person controlling it, from the Offerors on account of its agreement contained in this Section 7, to notify the Offerors in writing of the commencement thereof but the omission of such Underwriter so to notify the Offerors of any such action shall not release the Offerors from any liability which it may have to such Underwriter or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7. In case any such action shall be brought against an Underwriter or any such person controlling such Underwriter and such Underwriter shall notify the Offerors of the commencement thereof as above provided, the Offerors shall be entitled to participate in (and, to the extent that they shall wish, including the selection of counsel, to direct) the defense thereof, at their own expense. In case the Offerors elect to direct such defense and select such counsel, any Underwriter or controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless the employment of such counsel has been authorized in writing by the Offerors in connection with defending such action. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent.
(b)      Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, SoCo Capital, their directors and such of their officers who have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Offerors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Offerors set forth in Section 7(a) hereof, but only with respect to alleged untrue
 
13
 
 
statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or such documents as amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Offerors by or through the Representative on behalf of such Underwriter for use therein.
SECTION 8.   
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY.
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Offerors submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by, or on behalf of the Offerors and shall survive delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters.
(a)      The Representative may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Offerors, at any time at or prior to the Closing Date if (i) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended or there shall have been a material disruption in settlement of securities generally, (ii) minimum or maximum ranges for prices shall have been generally established on the New York Stock Exchange by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity, crisis or emergency (including, without limitation, acts of terrorism) affecting the United States, in any such case provided for in clauses (i) through (iv) with the result that, in the reasonable judgment of the Representative, the marketability of the Notes shall have been materially impaired.
(b)      If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Representative pursuant to subsection (a) above or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Offerors to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Offerors shall be unable to perform their obligations under this Agreement, then in any such case, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters, severally, for the reasonable fees and disbursements of Dewey Ballantine LLP and for the out of pocket expenses (in an amount not exceeding a total of $10,000) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes and, upon such reimbursement, the Offerors shall be absolved from any further liability hereunder, except as provided in Sections 4 and 7.
SECTION 10. 
DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS.
If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase the Notes that it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in
 
14
 
 
such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
(a)      if the principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Notes, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b)      if the principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Notes, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Offerors shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Final Supplemented Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

SOUTHERN COMPANY CAPITAL FUNDING, INC.
SERIES C 5.75% SENIOR NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 15, 2015
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to The Southern Company (the "Company") in connection with (i) the issuance and sale by Southern Company Capital Funding, Inc. ("SoCo Capital") of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series C 5.75% Senior Notes due November 15, 2015 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture dated as of February 1, 2002, among SoCo Capital, the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 16, 2005 (collectively, the "Indenture"); and (ii) its issuance of a guarantee (the "Notes Guarantee") of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. The purchase of the Notes today is pursuant to the terms of a Underwriting Agreement dated November 8, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, SoCo Capital and the underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters") for whom you are acting as representative. This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 5(c)(1) of the Underwriting Agreement.
All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-65178, 333-65178-01, 333-65178-02 and 333-65178-03) pertaining to the Notes, the Notes Guarantee and certain other securities (the "Registration Statement") filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and the prospectus dated August 7, 2001, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated November 8, 2005 (the "Final Supplemented Prospectus"), which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 (the "Form 10-K"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005 and the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company dated February 15, 2005, February 16, 2005, February 21, 2005, March 25, 2005, May 5, 2005, May 17, 2005, June 16, 2005, July 8, 2005, August 29, 2005, October 10, 2005 and
 
 
 
November 8, 2005 (the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing (except the certificate representing the Notes, of which we have examined a specimen), and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, other than those of the Company, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion, relying as to matters of New York law upon the opinion dated the date hereof rendered to you by Dewey Ballantine LLP, that:
1.       The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement.
2.       SoCo Capital has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business, as described in the Final Supplemented Prospectus, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and to issue the Notes.
3.       The execution, delivery and performance by the Offerors of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Offerors.
4.       All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee have been obtained; such orders are sufficient for the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee; the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee conform in all material respects with the terms of such orders; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States federal governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.
5.       The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by SoCo Capital and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of SoCo Capital, enforceable
 
2
 
 
against SoCo Capital in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of SoCo Capital's obligations under the Indenture may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and each of the Indenture and the Notes Guarantee conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
6.       The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by SoCo Capital and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor, will constitute valid and binding obligations of SoCo Capital, enforceable against SoCo Capital in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of SoCo Capital's obligations under the Notes may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
7.       Each of the Indenture and the Notes Guarantee has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture and the Notes Guarantee may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes Guarantee conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
8.       The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
9.       The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture and the performance by the Company of the Notes Guarantee do not and will not result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument known to us to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company), (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order
 
3
 
 
or decree known to us of any government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
10.     Neither the Company nor SoCo Capital is and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes, will be an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with your counsel. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of November 8, 2005, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents, as of their respective dates of filing with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) nothing came to our attention which gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date of filing of the Form 10-K (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission as of such date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Supplemented Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the date hereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and with respect to information set forth in the Final Supplemented Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Series C Senior Notes  Book-Entry Only Issuance  The Depository Trust Company."

We are members of the State Bar of Georgia and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of Georgia and the federal law of the United States and, to the extent set forth herein, the laws of the States of Delaware and New York.
This opinion is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transaction. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent, except that Dewey Ballantine LLP may rely on this opinion in giving its opinion pursuant to Section 5(c)(3) of the Underwriting Agreement insofar as such opinion relates to matters of Georgia law.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation ("BNY"), in connection with the purchase by the underwriters (the "Underwriters") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated November 8, 2005 among Southern Company Capital Funding, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), The Southern Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), and the Underwriters of $250,000,000 principal amount of Series C 5.75% Senior Notes due November 15, 2015 (the "Notes") issued by the Company. The Notes are being issued under the Senior Note Indenture dated as of February 1, 2002 among the Company, the Guarantor and BNY, as trustee (in such capacity, the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented, including by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 16, 2005 among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (collectively, the "Indenture").
For purposes of this opinion, we have reviewed the Indenture and such other documents, records and papers, and satisfied ourselves as to such other matters, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for this opinion. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of BNY and of public officials. In such review, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies or forms and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have assumed that BNY has been duly incorporated and that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and
 
 
 
the Guarantor and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms against, the Company and the Guarantor.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications below, we are of the opinion that:
1.       BNY is a banking corporation validly existing under the laws of the State of New York with corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture.
2.       The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Trustee enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and, for purposes of this opinion, do not hold ourselves out as experts on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. The opinions expressed herein are limited to matters governed by the laws of the State of New York.
This opinion is solely for the benefit of the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes and may not be relied upon by the Company, the Guarantor or the Underwriters for any other purpose, or relied upon by or furnished to any other person, without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,

In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing (except the certificate representing the Notes, of which we have examined a specimen), and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion, relying as aforesaid and as to all matters covered hereby which are governed by or dependent upon the law of the State of Georgia upon the opinion of Troutman Sanders LLP dated the date hereof and addressed to you, that:
1.       The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement.
2.       SoCo Capital has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged and to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and to issue the Notes.
3.       The execution, delivery and performance by the Offerors of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Offerors, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Offerors.
4.       All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee have been obtained; such orders are sufficient for the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee; the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee conform in all material respects with the terms of such orders; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States federal governmental body is legally required for the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Notes Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.
5.       The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by SoCo Capital and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of SoCo Capital, enforceable
 
2
 
 
against SoCo Capital in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of SoCo Capital's obligations under the Indenture may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
6.       The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by SoCo Capital and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor, will constitute valid and binding obligations of SoCo Capital enforceable against SoCo Capital in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of SoCo Capital's obligations under the Notes may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
7.       Each of the Indenture and the Notes Guarantee has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture and the Notes Guarantee may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes Guarantee conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
8.       The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with counsel for the Company and SoCo Capital, and with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of

November 8, 2005, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents, as of their respective dates of filing with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) nothing came to our attention which gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date of filing of the Form 10-K (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission as of such date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Supplemented Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the date hereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and with respect to information set forth in the Final Supplemented Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Series C Senior Notes  Book-Entry Only Issuance  The Depository Trust Company."
We are members of the State Bar of New York and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States and, to the extent set forth herein, the laws of the States of Delaware and Georgia.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter.

SERIES C SENIOR NOTES
 
SECTION 101.           
Establishment
. There is hereby established a new series of Senior Notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's Series C 5.75% Senior Notes due November 15, 2015 (the "Series C Notes").
 
 
 
 
 
There are to be authenticated and delivered $250,000,000 principal amount of Series C Notes, and such principal amount of the Series C Notes may be increased from time to time pursuant to Section 301 of the Original Indenture. All Series C Notes need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Series C Notes. Any such additional Series C Notes will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued. No Series C Notes shall be authenticated and delivered in excess of the principal amount as so increased except as provided by Sections 203, 303, 304, 907 or 1107 of the Original Indenture. The Series C Notes shall be issued in definitive fully registered form.

Each Series C Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
 
SECTION 102.           
Definitions

The unpaid principal amount of the Series C Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 5.75% per annum until paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be paid semiannually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to the Person in whose name the Series C Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date,
provided
that interest payable at the Stated Maturity of principal or on a Redemption Date as
 
2
 
 
provided herein will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person or Persons in whose name the Series C Notes are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of the Series C Notes not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Series C Notes shall be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture.
 
Payments of interest on the Series C Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Series C Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Payment of the principal and interest due at the Stated Maturity or earlier redemption of the Series C Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Series C Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Series C Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

The rights of Holders of such Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary.

Subject to the procedures of the Depositary, a Global Security shall be exchangeable for Series C Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company, or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company, in each case within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such cessation, (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) there shall have occurred an Event of Default with respect to the Series C Notes. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Series C Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.
 
SECTION 106.          
Transfer
