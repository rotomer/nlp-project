Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement On February 20, 2006, the Compensation and Management Succession Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of The Southern Company ("Southern Company") established the performance criteria for fiscal year 2006 annual performance-based compensation and future performance-based dividend equivalent awards under the Southern Company Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Omnibus Plan"). These criteria are applicable to all participants in the Omnibus Plan, which include executive officers of Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Alabama Power Company ("Alabama Power"), Georgia Power Company ("Georgia Power"), Gulf Power Company ("Gulf Power"), Mississippi Power Company ("Mississippi Power") and Savannah Electric and Power Company ("Savannah Electric") (together the "subsidiary registrants"). The Compensation Committee also approved annual base salary adjustments for Southern Company executive officers and approved the parameters for annual base salary adjustments for executive officers of the subsidiary registrants. Performance Goals under the Omnibus Plan Under the Omnibus Plan, annual performance-based compensation may be paid to the executive officers of Southern Company and the subsidiary registrants. Annual performance-based compensation is based on the attainment of corporate performance goals and attainment of the respective business unit's operational goals. On February 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee established the corporate performance goals for fiscal year 2006, which include specific targets for (i) Southern Company earnings per share (50 percent weighting) and (ii) subsidiary companies' net income or return on equity (50 percent weighting).
With respect to each corporate performance goal, the Compensation Committee established a target performance level. Performance above or below the targets will result in proportionately higher or lower annual performance-based compensation. The amount will then be adjusted, up or down, based on the degree of achievement of the respective business unit's operational goals. For fiscal year 2006, the Compensation Committee also established these operational goal categories, including (i) capital expenditures, (ii) transmission and distribution system reliability, (iii) customer satisfaction, (iv) plant availability, (v) safety, (vi) diversity and (vii) price. A target percentage of base pay was established for each executive officer based on his or her position level for target-level performance. The target percentage of base pay established for David M. Ratcliffe, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, Thomas A. Fanning, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Southern Company, Michael D. Garrett, Executive Vice President of Southern Company and President and Chief Executive Officer of Georgia Power, G. Edison Holland, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Southern Company, and Charles D. McCrary, Executive Vice President of Southern Company and President and Chief Executive Officer of Alabama Power, are 100 percent, 75 percent, 75 percent, 60 percent and 75 percent, respectively. Target annual performance-based compensation for the other executive officers of Southern Company and the subsidiary registrants ranges from 40 percent to 60 percent of base salary. Annual performance-based compensation may range from zero percent of the target to 230 percent based on actual corporate and individual performance.
No annual performance-based compensation will be paid if performance is below a threshold level or if a minimum Southern Company net income level is not reached. Also, no annual performance-based compensation will be paid if Southern Company's net income is not sufficient to fund the common stock dividend at the same level as the prior year. The Compensation Committee also capped the maximum amount of the annual performance-based compensation for each Southern Company executive officer at 0.6 percent of Southern Company's net income. Under the Omnibus Plan, executive officers of Southern Company and the subsidiary registrants also may receive performance-based dividend equivalents on most stock options held at the end of a fiscal year. Payments of performance-based dividend equivalents are based on total stockholder return over a four-year measurement period. On February 20, 2006, the Compensation Committee (i) irrevocably authorized the payment of performance-based dividend equivalents for the four-year performance measurement period ending on December 31, 2006 based on previously established performance criteria, and (ii) established the performance criteria for performance-based dividend equivalents payable for the four-year performance measurement period ending on December 31, 2009. For these performance measurement periods, dividend equivalents may range from approximately 5 percent of Southern Company's common stock dividend paid during the year if total stockholder return over a four-year measurement period, compared to a group of other utility companies, is at the first position above the 10th percentile to 100 percent of the dividend paid if total stockholder return reaches the 90th percentile. No dividend equivalents are paid if total stockholder return over the applicable period is at or below the 10th percentile or if Southern Company's net income is not sufficient to fund the current common
stock dividend. The Compensation Committee also capped the maximum amount of the performance dividend equivalents for each Southern Company executive officer at 0.6 percent of Southern Company's average net income over each four-year performance measurement period. Base Salary Adjustments On February 20, 2006, as part of its overall review of executive compensation for fiscal year 2006, the Compensation Committee approved annual base salary adjustments for the Chief Executive Officer and the four other most highly compensated executive officers of Southern Company. To assist the Committee in determining appropriate base salary adjustments for fiscal year 2006, the Committee retained an independent executive compensation consultant who provided information on total executive compensation paid at other large companies in the electric and gas utility industries. The current annual base salaries (as adjusted) of Messrs. Ratcliffe, Fanning, Garrett, Holland and McCrary are $1,039,300, $592,000, $586,000, $526,000 and $615,000 respectively. In addition, the Compensation Committee approved the annual base salary adjustments for other executive officers of Southern Company and the parameters for establishing the annual base salary adjustments for the executive officers of the subsidiary registrants. In accordance with these parameters, the Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company and the Chief Executive Officer of each subsidiary registrant, as appropriate, will approve annual base salary adjustments for executive officers of the subsidiary registrants. All base salary adjustments will be effective March 1, 2006. Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
