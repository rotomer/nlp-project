See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  "Income Tax Matters  Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits" of The Southern Company ("Southern") in Item 7 of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  "Income Tax Matters  Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits" of Southern, "Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits" in Note (B) to the financial statements of Southern and Note (J) to the financial statements of Southern in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
Southern has taken additional actions in connection with its synthetic fuel investments. As previously reported, synthetic fuel production at Carbontronics Synfuels Investors, LP ("Carbontronics") was idled in May 2006 due to continued uncertainty over the value of tax credits. Production at Carbontronics was restarted in September due to reduced oil prices in the third quarter of 2006. In the first nine months of 2006, Southern entered into derivative transactions designed to reduce its exposure to changes in the value of tax credits associated with its synthetic fuel investments in 2006. These derivative transactions will be marked to market over the remainder of the year through other income (expense), net. In October 2006, Southern entered into additional derivative transactions to reduce its exposure to the potential phase-out of these tax credits in 2007. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.
