The addresses of the registrants have not changed since the last report.
 
This combined Form 8-K is furnished separately by six registrants: The Southern Company, Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company and Southern Power Company. Information contained herein relating to each registrant is furnished by each registrant solely on its own behalf. Each registrant makes no representation as to information relating to the other registrants.
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
On October 26, 2006, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the periods ended September 30, 2006. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In Exhibits 99.01 and 99.05 attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K, Southern Company, in addition to presenting kilowatt-hour sales information for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005, as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), has also provided adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005. In 2005, certain Georgia Power Company industrial customers were reclassified from industrial to commercial to be consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. The adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information reclassifies 2005 kilowatt-hour sales for commercial and industrial customers to be consistent with the presentation for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006. Southern Company believes that the adjusted kilowatt-hour sales information is useful to investors because it provides investors with more consistent information for purposes of comparing 2005 and 2006 kilowatt-hour sales performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Exhibits 99.02 and 99.03 attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to including earnings and earnings per share in accordance with GAAP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, also include earnings and earnings per share for such periods excluding the results of Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments. As a result of tax credits generated from synthetic fuel production, Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments contributed significantly to Southern Company's earnings and earnings per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005. Due to higher levels of oil prices, such tax credits are expected to be partially or completely phased out during 2006. As a result, Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments did not contribute as significantly to earnings and earnings per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and are not expected to contribute as significantly to earnings and earnings per share in future periods. Accordingly, Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and

earnings per share excluding the results of the synthetic fuel investments is useful for investors because it provides investors with additional information for purposes of comparing Southern Company's performance for such periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Southern Company posts strong third quarter earnings;
meets record demand as economic, customer growth continue
 
ATLANTA  Southern Company reported third quarter earnings of $738 million, or 99 cents per share, as residential and commercial customer growth and a strong economy in the Southeast helped drive increased electricity usage.
 
The earnings compared with $722.2 million, or 97 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2005.
 
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Southern Company's earnings were $1.38 billion, or $1.86 per share, compared with $1.43 billion, or $1.92 per share, for the same period a year ago. Lower year-to-date earnings compared with the prior period were primarily the result of a reduction of tax credits related to the production of synthetic fuels.
 
The economy in the Southeast continued to grow during the third quarter. The number of customers served by Southern Company grew 1.8 percent above a year ago.
 
The positive earnings drivers in the third quarter were offset in part by higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses, and lower synthetic fuels tax credits.
 
Chairman, President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe said the company remains focused on its strategy and meeting its targets.
 
"Reliability is a cornerstone on which this company is built," said Ratcliffe. "The fact that our employees helped Southern Company make history this summer by meeting all-time record demands for electricity, while continuing to provide low-priced, reliable service, is a testament to their hard work and dedication to operational excellence."
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total revenues for the third quarter were $4.55 billion compared with $4.36 billion in the third quarter of 2005, a 4.4 percent increase. For the first nine months of the year, revenues totaled $11.2 billion, compared with $10.26 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 9.2 percent.
 
In the third quarter, kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 2.3 percent compared with sales during the 2005 third quarter. Residential electricity use increased 2.6 percent. During 2005, some Georgia Power industrial customers were reclassified from the industrial class to the commercial class to be consistent with the rate structure approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Adjusting the 2005 numbers for comparison purposes, electricity use by commercial customers  offices, stores and other non-manufacturing firms  increased 1.8 percent and industrial energy sales increased 2.6 percent. As reported, without adjusting the 2005 kilowatt-hour sales, commercial sales increased 1.9 percent and industrial sales increased 2.5 percent.
 
Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 2.8 percent compared with the third quarter last year.
 
With 4.3 million customers and more than 41,000 megawatts of generating capacity, Atlanta-based Southern Company (NYSE: SO) is the premier energy company serving the Southeast, one of America's fastest-growing regions. A leading U.S. producer of electricity, Southern Company owns electric utilities in four states and a growing competitive generation company, as well as fiber optics and wireless communications. Southern Company brands are known for excellent customer service, high reliability and retail electric prices that are significantly below the national average. Southern Company has received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction among U.S. electric service providers for seven consecutive years by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI).
