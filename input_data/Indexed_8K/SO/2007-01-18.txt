SECTION 3. FREE WRITING PROSPECTUSES. ------------------------- (a) The Company represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Senior Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as 7
defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus; each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Senior Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act, other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or a free writing prospectus that is not required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433; any such free writing prospectus (which shall include the pricing term sheet discussed in Section 3(b) hereof), the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representatives, is listed on Schedule III and herein called a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." (b) The Company agrees to prepare a pricing term sheet, substantially in the form of Schedule II hereto and approved by the Representatives, and to file such pricing term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act within the time period prescribed by such Rule.

(d) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus or include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter a free writing prospectus or other document, the use of which has been consented to by the Representatives, which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives, expressly for use therein. (e) The Company agrees that if there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Pricing Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will notify the Representatives so that any use of the Pricing Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented. SECTION 4. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. The Company covenants with the Underwriters as follows: 8
(a) The Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, will deliver to the Underwriters conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of all amendments thereto, heretofore or hereafter made, including any post-effective amendment (in each case including all exhibits filed therewith, and including unsigned copies of each consent and certificate included therein or filed as an exhibit thereto, except exhibits incorporated by reference, unless specifically requested). As soon as the Company is advised thereof, it will advise the Representatives orally of the issuance of any stop order under the 1933 Act with respect to the Registration Statement, or the institution of any proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act against the Company or related to the offering, of which the Company shall have received notice, and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to secure the prompt removal thereof, if issued. The Company will deliver to the Representatives sufficient conformed copies of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus and of all supplements and amendments thereto (in each case without exhibits) for distribution to the Underwriters and, from time to time, as many copies of the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus as the Underwriters may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act. (b) The Company will furnish the Underwriters with written or electronic copies of each amendment and supplement to the Final Supplemented Prospectus relating to the offering of the Senior Notes in such quantities as the Underwriters may from time to time reasonably request. If, during the period (not exceeding nine months) when the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the 1933 Act) shall be required by law in connection with the sale of any Senior Notes by an Underwriter, any event relating to or affecting the Company, or of which the Company shall be advised in writing by the Representatives, shall occur, which in the opinion of the Company or of Underwriters' counsel should be set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as the case may be, in order to make the Final Supplemented Prospectus not misleading in the light of the circumstances when it (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the 1933 Act) is delivered, or if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such period to amend or supplement the Final Supplemented Prospectus or to file under the 1934 Act any document incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus in order to comply with the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, the Company forthwith will (i) notify the Underwriters to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Senior Notes and (ii) at its expense, make any such filing or prepare and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or supplements or an amendment or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus which will supplement or amend the Final Supplemented Prospectus so that, as supplemented or amended, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Final Supplemented Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 9
173(a) under the 1933 Act) is delivered, not misleading or which will effect any other necessary compliance. In case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus in connection with the sale of any Senior Notes after the expiration of the period specified in the preceding sentence, the Company, upon the request of such Underwriter, will furnish to such Underwriter, at the expense of such Underwriter, a reasonable quantity of a supplemented or amended prospectus, or supplements or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus, complying with Section 10(a) of the 1933 Act. During the period specified in the second sentence of this subsection, the Company will continue to prepare and file with the Commission on a timely basis all documents or amendments required under the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; provided, that the Company shall not file such documents or amendments without also furnishing copies thereof prior to such filing to the Representatives and Dewey Ballantine LLP. (c) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Senior Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and the other jurisdictions of the United States as the Representatives may designate; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to file a consent to service of process or to file annual reports or to comply with any other requirements in connection with such qualification deemed by the Company to be unduly burdensome. (d) The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable but not later than 45 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement of the Company (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the rules and regulations under the 1933 Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement. (e) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within the time prescribed by Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, the Company will file the Final Supplemented Prospectus, in a form approved by the Representatives, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, with the Commission and will advise the Representatives of such filing and will confirm such advice in writing. Furthermore, the Company will make any other required filings pursuant to Rule 433(d)(1) of the 1933 Act within the time required by such Rule. (f) During a period of 15 days from the date of this Agreement, the Company will not, without the Representatives' prior written consent, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any Senior Notes or any security convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for the Senior Notes or any debt securities substantially similar to the Senior Notes (except for the Senior Notes issued pursuant to this Agreement). The 10
Representatives agree that commercial paper or other debt securities with scheduled maturities of less than one year are not subject to this Section 4(f). SECTION 5. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES. The Company will pay all expenses incidental to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the expenses of (i) the printing and filing of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the certificate(s) for the Senior Notes, (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and accountants, (iv) the qualification of the Senior Notes under securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(c) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of any blue sky survey (such fees and disbursements of counsel shall not exceed $3,500), (v) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto and of the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Final Supplemented Prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, (vi) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of any blue sky survey, (vii) the fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with its review of the offering contemplated by this Agreement, if applicable, (viii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Senior Notes, (ix) any fees payable in connection with the rating of the Senior Notes, (x) the cost and charges of any transfer agent or registrar, and (xi) the cost of qualifying the Senior Notes with The Depository Trust Company.

(c) At the Closing Date, there shall not have been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, any material adverse change in the business, properties or financial condition of the Company, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Representatives shall have received a certificate of the President or any Vice President of the Company, and dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 1 hereof are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date, (iii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act against the Company or related to the offering have been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. (d) The Representatives shall have received on the date hereof and shall receive on the Closing Date from Deloitte & Touche LLP, a letter or letters addressed to the Representatives (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives) dated the respective dates of delivery thereof to the effect that: (A) they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations under the 1933 Act; (B) in their opinion, the financial statements audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations under the 1934 Act; and (C) on the basis of certain limited procedures performed through a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, namely (i) reading the minute books of the Company; (ii) performing the procedures specified by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") for a review 12
of interim financial statement information as described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, "Interim Financial Information," on the unaudited financial statements, if any, of the Company incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, and on the latest available unaudited financial statements of the Company, if any, for any calendar quarter subsequent to the date of those incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable; and (iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding such unaudited financial statements or any specified unaudited amounts derived therefrom (it being understood that the foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments made in such letter, and accordingly that Deloitte & Touche LLP make no representations as to the sufficiency of such procedures for the Underwriters' purposes), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (1) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, for them to be in conformity with GAAP; (2) such unaudited condensed financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; (3) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and the unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges set forth in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (4) as of a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there has been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any decrease in net assets as compared with amounts shown in the latest unaudited balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, except in each case for changes or decreases which (i) the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, disclose have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs under existing pollution control financing arrangements, (iv) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (v) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy 13
mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, (vi) are occasioned by the reclassification of current maturities of long-term debt, or (vii) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and the unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which, if available, shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding audited amounts or ratios included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable. (e) On the Closing Date, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as it may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling it to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters. (f) No amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Final Supplemented Prospectus filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement (including any filing made by the Company pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the 1934 Act) shall be unsatisfactory in form to Dewey Ballantine LLP or shall contain information (other than with respect to an amendment or supplement relating solely to the activity of the Underwriters) which, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, shall materially impair the marketability of the Senior Notes. (g) The Company shall have performed its obligations when and as provided under this Agreement. If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company at any time prior to the Closing Date, and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 5, 8 and 10(b) hereof. SECTION 7. CONDITIONS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The obligations of the Company shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 6(a). In case such conditions shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company by mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Representatives. Any such termination shall be without 14
liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 8 and 10(b) hereof. SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION. --------------- (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and to reimburse any such Underwriter and such controlling person or persons, if any, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus or, if the Company shall furnish to the Underwriters any amendments or any supplements thereto, or shall make any filings pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the 1934 Act which are incorporated therein by reference, in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Final Supplemented Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, or in any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission which was made in such Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus, Basic Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or Final Supplemented Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives for use therein. Each Underwriter agrees, within ten days after the receipt by it of notice of the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought by it, or by any person controlling it, from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 8, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof but the omission of such Underwriter so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to such Underwriter or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8. In case any such action shall be brought against an Underwriter or any such person controlling such Underwriter and such Underwriter shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in (and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel, to direct) the defense thereof, at its own expense. In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel, any Underwriter or controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless the employment of such counsel has been authorized in writing by the Company in connection with defending such action. No indemnifying party 15
shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and such of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only with respect to alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or such documents as amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives for use therein. SECTION 9. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by, or on behalf of the Company and shall survive delivery of the Senior Notes to the Underwriters. SECTION 10. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. ------------------------ (a) The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Date if (i) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended or there shall have been a material disruption in settlement in securities generally, (ii) minimum or maximum ranges for prices shall have been generally established on the New York Stock Exchange by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity, crisis or emergency (including, without limitation, acts of terrorism) affecting the United States, in any such case provided for in clauses (i) through (iv) with the result that, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, the offering, sale or delivery of the Senior Notes on the terms 16
and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus shall have been materially impaired. (b) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Representatives pursuant to subsection (a) above or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then in any such case, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and disbursements of Dewey Ballantine LLP and for the out of pocket expenses (in an amount not exceeding $10,000) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Senior Notes and, upon such reimbursement, the Company shall be absolved from any further liability hereunder, except as provided in Sections 5 and 8. SECTION 11. DEFAULT BY AN UNDERWRITER. If an Underwriter shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase the Senior Notes that it is obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Senior Notes, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Senior Notes, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

This opinion is being delivered to you as Representatives pursuant to Section 6(b)(1) thereof. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File Nos. 333-138503, 333-138503-01 and 333-138503-02), pertaining to the Notes and certain other securities filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"), as it became effective under the Act (the "Registration Statement"); the Company's prospectus dated January 11, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus") as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated January 11, 2007 (the "Pricing Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Act which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarters ended March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 and the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company dated January 4, 2006, February 20, 2006, March 16, 2006, March 17, 2006, June 15, 2006, June 27, 2006, October 17, 2006, October 18, 2006, October 27, 2006 and November 16, 2006 (the "Pricing Exchange Act Documents"), and a prospectus supplement dated January 11, 2007 (together with the Basic Prospectus, the "Final Supplemented Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Pricing Exchange Act Documents and the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company dated January 11, 2007 (the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); and the Indenture. We have also examined the free writing prospectus prepared by the Company and filed with the Commission on January 11, 2007 pursuant to Rule 433 of the Act (the "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus"). The documents listed in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement, taken together, are collectively referred to as the "Pricing Disclosure Package." In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing (except the certificate representing the Notes, of which we have examined a specimen), and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. The Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement are herein referred to collectively as the "Agreements." Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion, relying as to matters of New York law upon the opinion dated the date hereof rendered to you by Dewey Ballantine LLP, that: 1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreements and the Notes. 2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. 2
3. All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes have been obtained; such orders are sufficient for the issuance and the sale of the Notes; the issuance and the sale of the Notes conform in all material respects with the terms of such orders; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of the State of Georgia or any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement. 4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus. 5. The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Notes may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus. 6. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. 7. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes do not and will not result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 or any subsequent report filed by the Company under the Exchange Act to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject (except for such conflicts, breaches 3
or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company), (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company. 8. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes, will not be an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with your counsel. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date, and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of January 11, 2007, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents, as of their respective dates of filing with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) nothing came to our attention which gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission as of such date), contained any untrue 4
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Final Supplemented Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the date hereof, any untrue statement therein of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and with respect to information set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Series 2007A Senior Notes - Book-Entry Only Issuance - The Depository Trust Company."

All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes have been obtained; such orders are sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Notes; the issuance and sale of the Notes conform in all material respects with the terms of such orders; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in 2
compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement. 4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus. 5. The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Notes may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus. 6. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with counsel to the Company. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date, and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of January 11, 2007, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act 3

Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. 7
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. (c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Senior Notes held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register. (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Senior Note shall bind every future Holder of the same Senior Note and the Holder of every Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Senior Note. (e) The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing and the authority of the Person executing the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section. (f) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Senior Notes of any series any Act, the Company may, at its option, by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Senior Notes entitled to take such Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Any such record date shall be fixed at the Company's discretion. If such a record date is fixed, such Act may be sought or given before or after the record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Senior Notes for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Senior Notes of such series Outstanding have authorized or agreed or consented to such Act, and for that purpose the Senior Notes of such series Outstanding shall be computed as of such record date. SECTION 105. NOTICES, ETC., TO TRUSTEE AND COMPANY Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with, (1) the Trustee by any Holder of a Senior Note or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust Services, or (2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to the attention of its Secretary, at 30 Ivan Allen Jr. Blvd, N.W., 8
Atlanta, Georgia 30308, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company. SECTION 106. NOTICE TO HOLDERS OF SENIOR NOTES; WAIVER Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Senior Notes of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such Notice. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Senior Notes shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. SECTION 107. CONFLICT WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act that is required to be a part of and govern this Indenture, such required provision shall control. SECTION 108. EFFECT OF HEADINGS AND TABLE OF CONTENTS The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 109. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. SECTION 110. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE In case any provision in this Indenture or the Senior Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 9
SECTION 111. BENEFITS OF INDENTURE Nothing in this Indenture or the Senior Notes, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto, their successors hereunder and the Holders of Senior Notes any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture. SECTION 112. GOVERNING LAW This Indenture and the Senior Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York. SECTION 113. LEGAL HOLIDAYS In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Senior Note shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Senior Notes) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be. SECTION 114. APPOINTMENT OF AGENT FOR SERVICE By the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Secretary of the Company is hereby appointed as the Company's agent upon which process may be served in any legal action or proceeding which may be instituted in any Federal or State court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, arising out of or relating to the Senior Notes or this Indenture. Service of process upon such agent at the office of such agent at 30 Ivan Allen, Jr. Blvd., N.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30308, Attention: Secretary, or at such other address as shall be given to the Trustee as provided in Section 105, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Company in any such legal action or proceeding, and the Company hereby submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in which any such legal action or proceeding is so instituted. Such appointment shall be irrevocable so long as the Holders of Senior Notes shall have any rights pursuant to the terms thereof or of this Indenture until the appointment of a successor by the Company and such successor's acceptance of such appointment. The Company further agrees to take any and all action, including the execution and filing of any and all such documents and instruments, as may be necessary to continue such designation and appointment of such agent or successor. 10
ARTICLE TWO SECTION 201. FORMS GENERALLY The Senior Notes of each series shall be in substantially the form appended to the supplemental indenture authorizing such series, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Senior Notes, as evidenced by their execution of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. In the absence of such specified denominations with respect to the Senior Notes of any series, the Senior Notes of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. The definitive Senior Notes may be printed, typewritten, lithographed or engraved on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the officers executing such Senior Notes, as evidenced by their execution of such Senior Notes. SECTION 202. FORM OF TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for a series of Senior Notes shall be in substantially the form appended to the supplemental indenture authorizing such series. SECTION 203. SENIOR NOTES ISSUABLE IN THE FORM OF A GLOBAL SECURITY (a) If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 301 that the Senior Notes of a particular series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 302 and the Company Order delivered to the Trustee thereunder, authenticate and deliver such Global Security or Securities, which (i) shall represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of such series to be represented by such Global Security or Securities, (ii) may provide that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Senior Notes represented thereby may from time to time be increased or reduced to reflect exchanges, (iii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or its nominee, (iv) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction and (v) shall bear a legend in accordance with the requirements of the Depositary. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 203 or of Section 303, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below, unless the terms of a Global Security expressly permit such Global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Senior Notes, a Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 303, only to a nominee of the Depositary for such Global Security, or to the 11
Depositary, or to a successor Depositary for such Global Security selected or approved by the Company, or to a nominee of such successor Depositary. (c) (1) If at any time the Depositary for a Global Security notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if at any time the Depositary for the Senior Notes for such series shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Global Security. If a successor Depositary for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of individual Senior Notes of such series in exchange for such Global Security, will authenticate and deliver individual Senior Notes of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security. (2) The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion, subject to the procedures of the Depositary, determine that the Senior Notes of any series issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Request for the authentication and delivery of individual Senior Notes of such series in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security, will authenticate and deliver individual Senior Notes of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. (3) If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 301 with respect to Senior Notes issued or issuable in the form of a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for individual Senior Notes of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (A) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Senior Note or Notes of the same series of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (B) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in an authorized denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes delivered to Holders thereof. (4) In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs, the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver individual Senior Notes in definitive form in authorized denominations. Upon the exchange of the entire principal amount of a Global Security for individual Senior Notes, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, Senior Notes issued in exchange 12
for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. Provided that the Company and the Trustee have so agreed, the Trustee shall deliver such Senior Notes to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes are registered. (5) Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, or changes in the rights of Holders, of Outstanding Senior Notes represented thereby shall be made in such manner and by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered pursuant to Section 302 with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section 302, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any such Global Security in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order pursuant to Section 302 has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to such Global Security shall be in writing but need not be accompanied by or contained in an Officers' Certificate and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel. ARTICLE THREE THE SENIOR NOTES SECTION 301. AMOUNT UNLIMITED; ISSUABLE IN SERIES The aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited. The Senior Notes may be issued in one or more series. There may be established, pursuant to one or more supplemental indentures hereto, prior to the issuance of Senior Notes of any series, (1) the title of the Senior Notes of the series (which shall distinguish the Senior Notes of the series from Senior Notes of all other series); (2) any limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes of the series which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture (except for Senior Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Senior Notes of the series pursuant to Sections 203, 303, 304, 907 or 1107); (3) the Person to whom interest on a Senior Note of the series shall be payable if other than the Person in whose name that Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest; (4) the date or dates on which the principal of the Senior Notes of the series is payable; 13
(5) the rate or rates at which the Senior Notes of the series shall bear interest, if any, or any method by which such rate or rates shall be determined, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the Interest Payment Dates on which such interest shall be payable, the Regular Record Date for the interest payable on Senior Notes on any Interest Payment Date and the basis upon which interest shall be calculated if other than that of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months; (6) the place or places where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Senior Notes of the series shall be payable; (7) the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which Senior Notes of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company; (8) the obligation, if any, of the Company to redeem or purchase Senior Notes of the series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of a Holder thereof and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions upon which, Senior Notes of the series shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation; (9) the date or dates, if any, after which such Senior Notes may be converted or exchanged at the option of the Holder into or for shares of common stock of the Company and the terms for any such conversion or exchange; (10) if other than denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, the denominations in which Senior Notes of the series shall be issuable; (11) if the amount of payments of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Senior Notes of the series may be determined with reference to an index or formula, the manner in which such amounts shall be determined; (12) if other than the principal amount thereof, the portion of the principal amount of Senior Notes of the series which shall be payable upon declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502; (13) any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the Events of Default or covenants of the Company as provided herein pertaining to the Senior Notes of the series, and any change in the rights of the Trustee or Holders of such series pursuant to Section 901 or 902; (14) any additions to the definitions currently set forth in this Indenture with respect to such series; (15) whether the Senior Notes of the series shall be issued in whole or in part in the form of a Global Security or Securities; the terms and conditions, if any, upon which such Global Security or Securities may be exchanged in whole or in part for certificated Senior Notes of such series and 14
of like tenor of any authorized denomination and the circumstances under which such exchange may occur, if other than in the manner provided for in Section 203; the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities; and the form of any legend or legends to be borne by any such Global Security in addition to or in lieu of the legend referred to in Section 203; (16) any restriction or condition on the transferability of such Senior Notes; and (17) any other terms of the series. All Senior Notes of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to the date or dates from which interest, if any, shall accrue and denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in the terms of such Senior Notes determined or established as provided above. All Senior Notes of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened for issuances of additional Senior Notes of such series. SECTION 302. EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING The Senior Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Senior Notes may be manual or facsimile. Senior Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at the time relevant to the authorization thereof the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Senior Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Senior Notes. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Senior Notes of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Senior Notes, and the Trustee, in accordance with the Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Senior Notes. If all of the Senior Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time and if the supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Senior Notes and determining the terms of particular Senior Notes of such series, such as interest rate, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating Senior Notes hereunder, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Senior Notes, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon: (1) an Opinion of Counsel, to the effect that: (a) the form and terms of such Senior Notes or the manner of determining such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and 15
(b) such Senior Notes, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and (2) an Officers' Certificate stating, to the best knowledge of each signer of such certificate, that no event which is, or after notice or lapse of time would become, an Event of Default with respect to any of the Senior Notes shall have occurred and be continuing. The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Senior Notes if the issue of such Senior Notes pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Senior Notes and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. If all the Senior Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate at the time of issuance of each such Senior Note, but such opinion and certificate shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Senior Note of such series to be issued. Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Senior Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Senior Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Senior Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Senior Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. SECTION 303. REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE The Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the Security Registrar designated pursuant to this Section 303 or Section 1002 a register (referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Senior Notes and of transfers of Senior Notes. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Senior Notes and transfers of Senior Notes as herein provided. Subject to Section 203, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Senior Note of any series at the office or agency maintained for such purpose for such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Senior Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. 16
Subject to Section 203, Senior Notes of any series may be exchanged, at the option of the Holder, for Senior Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Senior Notes to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Senior Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Senior Notes that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Senior Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Senior Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Senior Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 907 or 1107 not involving any transfer. The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange Senior Notes of any series during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is given identifying the serial numbers of the Senior Notes of that series called for redemption, or (ii) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Senior Notes so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Senior Note being redeemed in part. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. SECTION 304. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SENIOR NOTES -------------------------------------------------- If any mutilated Senior Note is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Senior Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Senior Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them 17
and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Senior Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note, a new Senior Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Senior Note, pay such Senior Note. Upon the issuance of any new Senior Note under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Senior Note of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Senior Note shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Senior Notes of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes. SECTION 305. PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Senior Notes, interest on any Senior Note that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Any interest on any Senior Note of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Senior Note of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the 18
Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Senior Notes of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Senior Notes of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Senior Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Senior Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Senior Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Senior Note. SECTION 306. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS Prior to due presentment of a Senior Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Senior Note is registered as the owner of such Senior Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest on such Senior Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Senior Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. SECTION 307. CANCELLATION All Senior Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time 19
deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Senior Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Senior Notes so delivered shall be canceled by the Trustee. No Senior Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Senior Notes canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Senior Notes held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with a Company Order and the Trustee shall promptly deliver a certificate of disposition to the Company. SECTION 308. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Senior Notes of any series, interest on the Senior Notes of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. ARTICLE FOUR SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE SECTION 401. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE This Indenture shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes herein expressly provided for) and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when (1) either (A) all Senior Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Senior Notes that have been destroyed, lost or stolen and that have been replaced or paid as provided for in Section 304 and (ii) Senior Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Senior Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) have been called for redemption or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, 20
and the Company, in the case of (B) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as funds in trust for the purpose described above (i) money in an amount sufficient, or (ii) (a) Government Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide not later than one day before the due date of any payment referred to in clause (B) of this subparagraph money in an amount, or (b) a combination of such money and such Government Obligations, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Senior Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be, or if later, the date of payment; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. In the event there are Senior Notes of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Senior Notes of all series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then the effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of such instruments from all Trustees hereunder. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Company to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614, and, if money or Government Obligations shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge. SECTION 402. APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY; INDEMNIFICATION (a) Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money or Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 and all money received by the Trustee in respect of Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes, and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company or an Affiliate acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee. 21
(b) The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 401, or the interest and principal received in respect of such obligations other than any amount payable by or on behalf of Holders. (c) The Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any Government Obligations or money held by it as provided in Section 401 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the same opinion given to the Trustee pursuant to said Section), is then in excess of the amount thereof which then would have been required to be deposited for the purpose for which such obligations or money was deposited or received. ARTICLE FIVE REMEDIES SECTION 501. EVENTS OF DEFAULT "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Senior Notes of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Senior Note of that series when it becomes due and payable on an Interest Payment Date other than at Maturity and continuance of such default for a period of thirty (30) days; or (2) default in the payment of the principal of, (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note of that series at its Maturity; or (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Senior Note of that series and continuance of such default for a period of three Business Days; or (4) default in the performance or breach of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Senior Notes other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee, or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or 22
(5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition by one or more Persons other than the Company seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official for the Company or for any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (6) the commencement by the Company of a case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in a case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Senior Notes of that series in the supplemental indenture authorizing such series. SECTION 502. ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series may declare the principal amount (or such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all of the Senior Notes of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Senior Notes of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay 23
(A) all overdue interest on all Senior Notes of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any) any Senior Notes of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Senior Notes of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Senior Notes of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 503. COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE --------------------------------------------------------------- The Company covenants that if an Event of Default occurs under Section 501(1), (2) or (3) with respect to any Senior Notes the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Senior Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on such Senior Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607. If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Senior Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Senior Notes, wherever situated. If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Senior Notes of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific 24
enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. SECTION 504. TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Senior Notes or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Senior Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, (1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Senior Notes and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of Senior Notes allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Senior Notes to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Senior Notes, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Senior Note any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Senior Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Senior Note in any such proceeding. 25
SECTION 505. TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF SENIOR NOTES ------------------------------------------------------------- All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Senior Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Senior Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Senior Notes in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. SECTION 506. APPLICATION OF MONEY COLLECTED Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Senior Notes, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; and Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Senior Notes in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Senior Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and Third: The balance, if any, to the Company or any other Person or Persons entitled thereto. SECTION 507. LIMITATION ON SUITS No Holder of any Senior Note of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless: (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes of that series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; 26
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. SECTION 508. UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND INTEREST Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Senior Notes shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest on such Senior Note on the due dates expressed in such Senior Note (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 509. RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES If the Trustee or any Holder of a Senior Note has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Notes shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 510. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes in the last paragraph of Section 304, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Senior Notes is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. 27
SECTION 511. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Senior Note to exercise any right or remedy upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders of Senior Notes may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Senior Notes. SECTION 512. CONTROL BY HOLDERS OF SENIOR NOTES The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Senior Notes of such series, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where reasonable indemnity would not be adequate, and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 513. WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Senior Notes of such series, waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note of such series, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Senior Note of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 514. UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Senior Note by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in 28
its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Senior Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Senior Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date). SECTION 515. WAIVER OF STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE SIX THE TRUSTEE SECTION 601. CERTAIN DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES (a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series, (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform, with respect to Senior Notes of such series, such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may, with respect to Senior Notes of such series, conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture. (b) In case an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise, with respect to Senior Notes of such series, such of the rights and powers vested in it by 29
this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

MAY HOLD SENIOR NOTES The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Senior Notes and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. SECTION 606. MONEY HELD IN TRUST Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company. SECTION 607.

(d) If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of a Senior Note who has been a Holder of a Senior Note for at least six months, or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder of a Senior Note who has been a bona fide Holder of a Senior Note for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Senior Notes of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Senior Notes and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder of a Senior Note who has been a bona fide Holder of a Senior Note of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of such series. 34
(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of such series of Senior Notes as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. SECTION 611. ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more series shall execute and deliver a supplemental indenture hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Senior Notes, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee 35
shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Senior Notes of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be. (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 612. MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Senior Notes shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Senior Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Senior Notes. SECTION 613. PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Senior Notes), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of the Trust Indenture Act: (a) "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and (b) "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company (or any such obligor) for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Company (or any such obligor) arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation. 36
SECTION 614. APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT At any time when any of the Senior Notes remain Outstanding the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Senior Notes that shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Senior Notes of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 304, and Senior Notes so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Senior Notes by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Senior Notes, if any, of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. 37
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. The provisions of Sections 306, 604 and 605 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent. If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Senior Notes of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form: This is one of the Senior Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

SECTION 1103. SELECTION BY TRUSTEE OF SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED --------------------------------------------------- If the Senior Notes are registered in the name of only one Holder, any partial redemptions shall be pro rata; provided that, in the case of any such Holder which is a Depositary or a nominee thereof, nothing in this sentence shall affect the right of such Depositary to select for redemption the positions held by its participants in accordance with the procedures of such Depositary. If the Senior Notes are held in definitive form by more than one Holder and if less than all the Senior Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Senior Notes to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Senior Notes of such series not previously called for redemption, by lot or other such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Senior Notes of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Senior Notes of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Senior Notes of that series. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Senior Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Senior Notes selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Senior Notes shall relate, in the case of any Senior Notes redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Senior Notes which has been or is to be redeemed.

All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price (or if not then ascertainable, the manner of calculation thereof), (3) if less than all the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Senior Notes to be redeemed, (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Senior Note to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, (5) the place or places where such Senior Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. Notice of redemption of Senior Notes to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. SECTION 1105. DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE --------------------------- Except as otherwise provided in a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 301, prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company or its Affiliate is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest, if any, on all the Senior Notes which are to be redeemed on that date. SECTION 1106. SENIOR NOTES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE --------------------------------------- Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Senior Notes so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified together with any accrued interest thereon, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Senior Notes shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Senior Note for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Senior Note shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 301, installments of interest on Senior Notes whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Senior Notes, or one or more Predecessor Securities, 48
registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 305. If any Senior Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Senior Note. SECTION 1107. SENIOR NOTES REDEEMED IN PART ----------------------------- Any Senior Note that is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at an office or agency of the Company therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Senior Note without service charge, a new Senior Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Senior Note so surrendered. ARTICLE TWELVE SINKING FUNDS SECTION 1201. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE ------------------------ The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Senior Notes of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Senior Notes of such series. 49
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Senior Notes of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Senior Notes of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Senior Notes of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Senior Notes of any series as provided for by the terms of Senior Notes of such series. SECTION 1202. SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH SENIOR NOTES ------------------------------------------------------- The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Senior Notes of a series (other than any previously called for redemption), and (2) may apply as a credit Senior Notes of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Senior Notes or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Senior Notes, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Senior Notes of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Senior Notes as provided for by the terms of such series; provided that such Senior Notes have not been previously so credited. Such Senior Notes shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Senior Notes for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 1203. REDEMPTION OF SENIOR NOTES FOR SINKING FUND ------------------------------------------- Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Senior Notes, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Senior Notes of that series pursuant to Section 1202 and stating the basis for such credit and that such Senior Notes have not previously been so credited and will also deliver to the Trustee any Senior Notes to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Senior Notes to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Senior Notes shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107. ARTICLE THIRTEEN MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS SECTION 1301. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS -------------------------- An incorporator or any past, present or future director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Senior Notes or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Senior Note, each Holder shall waive and release all such liability. Such waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of the Senior Notes. SECTION 1302. ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT -------------------------- The Company shall have the right at all times to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Indenture to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provided that, in the event of any such assignment, the Company shall remain primarily liable for the performance of all such obligations. This Indenture may also be assigned by the Company in connection with a transaction described in Article Eight. This Indenture shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Trustee, the Holders, any Security Registrar, Paying Agent, and Authenticating Agent and their respective successors and assigns. 50
