(a)  The Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, will deliver to the Underwriters conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of all amendments thereto, heretofore or hereafter made, including any post-effective amendment (in each case including all exhibits filed therewith, and including unsigned copies of each consent and certificate included therein or filed as an exhibit thereto, except exhibits incorporated by reference, unless specifically requested). As soon as the Company is advised thereof, it will advise the Underwriters orally of the issuance of any stop order under the 1933 Act with respect to the Registration Statement, or the institution of any proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act against the Company or related to the offering, of which the Company shall have received notice, and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to secure the prompt removal thereof, if issued.

(b)  The Company will furnish the Underwriters with written or electronic copies of each amendment and supplement to the Final Supplemented Prospectus relating to the offering of the Senior Notes in such quantities as the Underwriters may from time to time reasonably request. If, during the period (not exceeding nine months) when the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the 1933 Act) shall be required by law in connection with the sale of any Senior Notes by an Underwriter, any event relating to or affecting the Company, or of which the Company shall be advised in writing by the Underwriters, shall occur, which in the opinion of the Company or of Underwriters' counsel should be set forth in a supplement to or an amendment of the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as the case may be, in order to make the Final Supplemented Prospectus not misleading in the light of the circumstances when it (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the 1933 Act) is delivered, or if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such period to amend or supplement the Final Supplemented Prospectus or to file under the 1934 Act any document incorporated by reference in the Final Supplemented Prospectus in order to comply with the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, the Company forthwith will (i) notify the Underwriters to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Senior Notes and (ii) at its expense, make any such filing or prepare and furnish to the Underwriters a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or supplements or an amendment or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus which will supplement or amend the Final Supplemented Prospectus so that, as supplemented or amended, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Final Supplemented Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the 1933 Act) is delivered, not misleading or which will effect any other necessary compliance. In case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus in connection with the sale of any Senior Notes after the expiration of the period specified in the preceding sentence, the Company, upon the request of such Underwriter, will furnish to such Underwriter, at the expense of such Underwriter, a reasonable quantity of a supplemented or amended prospectus, or supplements or amendments to the Final Supplemented Prospectus, complying with Section 10(a) of the 1933 Act. During the period specified in the second sentence of this subsection, the Company will continue to prepare and file with the Commission on a timely basis all documents or amendments required under the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; provided, that the Company shall not file such documents or amendments without also furnishing copies thereof prior to such filing to the Underwriters and Dewey Ballantine LLP.
(c)  The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Senior Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and the other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to file a consent to service of process or to file annual reports or to comply with any other requirements in connection with such qualification deemed by the Company to be unduly burdensome.
(d)  The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable but not later than 45 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement of the Company (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the rules and regulations under the 1933 Act) covering a twelve-month period beginning not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
(e)  As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within the time prescribed by Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, the Company will file the Final Supplemented Prospectus, in a form approved by the Underwriters, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, with the Commission and will advise the Underwriters of such filing and will confirm such advice in writing. Furthermore, the Company will make any other required filings pursuant to Rule 433(d)(1) of the 1933 Act within the time required by such Rule.
(f)  During a period of 15 days from the date of this Agreement, the Company will not, without the Underwriters' prior written consent, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any Senior Notes or any security convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for the Senior Notes or any debt securities substantially similar to the Senior Notes (except for the Senior Notes issued pursuant to this Agreement). The Underwriters agree that commercial paper or other debt securities with scheduled maturities of less than one year are not subject to this Section 4(f).
(g)  If at any time when Senior Notes remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Underwriters, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Senior Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Underwriters, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Underwriters of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other reasonable action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Senior Notes to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.

(1)  The opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Troutman Sanders LLP, counsel for the Company, substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule IV.
(2)  The opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Emmet, Marvin & Martin, LLP, counsel to the Trustee, substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule V.
(3)  The opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule VI.
(c)  At the Closing Date, there shall not have been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, any material adverse change in the business, properties or financial condition of the Company, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Underwriters shall have received a certificate of the President or any Vice President of the Company, and dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 1 hereof are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date, (iii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act against the Company or related to the offering have been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission.
(d)  The Underwriters shall have received on the date hereof and shall receive on the Closing Date from Deloitte & Touche LLP, a letter or letters addressed to the Underwriters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Underwriters) dated the respective dates of delivery thereof to the effect that: (A) they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations under the 1933 Act; (B) in their opinion, the financial statements audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations under the 1934 Act; and (C) on the basis of certain limited procedures performed through a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, namely (i) reading the minute books of the Company; (ii) performing the procedures specified by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") for a review of interim financial statement information as described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, "Interim Financial Information," on the unaudited financial statements, if any, of the Company incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, and on the latest available unaudited financial statements of the Company, if any, for any calendar quarter subsequent to the date of those incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable; and (iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding such unaudited financial statements or any specified unaudited amounts derived therefrom (it being understood that the foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments made in such letter, and accordingly that Deloitte & Touche LLP make no representations as to the sufficiency of such procedures for the Underwriters' purposes), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (1) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, for them to be in conformity with GAAP; (2) such unaudited condensed financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; (3) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and the unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges set forth in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (4) as of a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there has been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any decrease in net assets as compared with amounts shown in the latest unaudited balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, except in each case for changes or decreases which (i) the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, disclose have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs under existing pollution control financing arrangements, (iv) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (v) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, (vi) are occasioned by the reclassification of current maturities of long-term debt, or (vii) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) the unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and the unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which, if available, shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding audited amounts or ratios included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable.
(e)  On the Closing Date, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as it may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling it to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Underwriters and Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.
(f)  No amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Final Supplemented Prospectus filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement (including any filing made by the Company pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the 1934 Act) shall be unsatisfactory in form to Dewey Ballantine LLP or shall contain information (other than with respect to an amendment or supplement relating solely to the activity of the Underwriters) which, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters, shall materially impair the marketability of the Senior Notes.
(g)  The Company shall have performed its obligations when and as provided under this Agreement.
If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Underwriters by notice to the Company at any time prior to the Closing Date, and such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 5, 8 and 10(b) hereof.
SECTION 7. 
CONDITIONS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY
. The obligations of the Company shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 6(a). In case such conditions shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company by mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Underwriters. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 8 and 10(b) hereof.
SECTION 8. 
INDEMNIFICATION
.
(a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, and to reimburse any such Underwriter and such controlling person or persons, if any, for any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus or, if the Company shall furnish to the Underwriters any amendments or any supplements thereto, or shall make any filings pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the 1934 Act which are incorporated therein by reference, in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Final Supplemented Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, or in any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission which was made in such Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus, Basic Prospectus, Pricing Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or Final Supplemented Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter for use therein. Each Underwriter agrees, within ten days after the receipt by it of notice of the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought by it, or by any person controlling it, from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 8, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof but the omission of such Underwriter so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to such Underwriter or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8. In case any such action shall be brought against an Underwriter or any such person controlling such Underwriter and such Underwriter shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in (and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel, to direct) the defense thereof, at its own expense. In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel, any Underwriter or controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person unless the employment of such counsel has been authorized in writing by the Company in connection with defending such action. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent.
(b)  Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and such of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only with respect to alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or such documents as amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter for use therein.
SECTION 9. 
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY
. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by, or on behalf of the Company and shall survive delivery of the Senior Notes to the Underwriters.
SECTION 10. 
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
.
(a)  The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Date if (i) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended or there shall have been a material disruption in settlement in securities generally, (ii) minimum or maximum ranges for prices shall have been generally established on the New York Stock Exchange by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity, crisis or emergency (including, without limitation, acts of terrorism) affecting the United States, in any such case provided for in clauses (i) through (iv) with the result that, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters, the offering, sale or delivery of the Senior Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus shall have been materially impaired.
(b)       If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters pursuant to subsection (a) above or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then in any such case, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and disbursements of Dewey Ballantine LLP and for the out of pocket expenses (in an amount not exceeding $10,000) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Senior Notes and, upon such reimbursement, the Company shall be absolved from any further liability hereunder, except as provided in Sections 5 and 8.
SECTION 11. 
DEFAULT BY AN UNDERWRITER
. If an Underwriter shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase the Senior Notes that it is obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the non-defaulting Underwriter shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for the non-defaulting Underwriter, or any other underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, the non-defaulting Underwriter shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
(a)  if the principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the Senior Notes, the non-defaulting Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof, or
(b)  if the principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the Senior Notes, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY
Series 2007B Floating Rate Extendible Senior Notes
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to The Southern Company (the "Company") in connection with (i) the Company's issuance of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series 2007B Floating Rate Extendible Senior Notes (the "Notes") pursuant to a Senior Note Indenture dated as of January 1, 2007, by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as heretofore supplemented and as further supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 28, 2007 (collectively, the "Indenture"); and (ii) the purchase by the Underwriters of the Notes pursuant to the terms of an Underwriting Agreement dated March 20, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and the Underwriters. Pursuant to a Calculation Agent Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2007 (the "Calculation Agent Agreement"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as calculation agent thereunder (the "Calculation Agent"), the Company has engaged the Calculation Agent to perform certain services with respect to the floating interest rate on the Notes. This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(b)(1) thereof.
All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File Nos. 333-138503, 333-138503-01 and 333-138503-02), pertaining to the Notes and certain other securities filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as it became effective under the Act (the "Registration Statement"); the Company's prospectus dated January 11, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus") as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated March 20, 2007 (the "Pricing Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Act which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company dated January 11, 2007, February 5, 2007 and February 20, 2007 (the "Pricing Exchange Act Documents"), and a prospectus supplement dated March 20, 2007 (together with the Basic Prospectus, the "Final Supplemented Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Pricing Exchange Act Documents and the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company dated March 20, 2007 (the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); and the Indenture. We have also examined the free writing prospectus prepared by the Company and filed with the Commission on March 20, 2007 pursuant to Rule 433 of the Act (the "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus"). The documents listed in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement, taken together, are collectively referred to as the "Pricing Disclosure Package."
In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing (except the certificate representing the Notes, of which we have examined a specimen), and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
The Indenture, the Calculation Agent Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement are herein referred to collectively as the "Agreements."
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion, relying as to matters of New York law upon the opinion dated the date hereof rendered to you by Dewey Ballantine LLP, that:
1.         The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreements and the Notes.
2.         The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
3.         All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes have been obtained; such orders are sufficient for the issuance and the sale of the Notes; the issuance and the sale of the Notes conform in all material respects with the terms of such orders; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of the State of Georgia or any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.
4.         Each of the Calculation Agent Agreement and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Calculation Agent and the Trustee, respectively, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture and the Calculation Agent Agreement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
5.         The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Notes may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
6.         The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
7.         The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Indenture and the Calculation Agent Agreement and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes do not and will not result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 or any subsequent report filed by the Company under the Exchange Act to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company), (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
8.         The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes, will not be an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9.         The statements and legal conclusions contained in the Final Supplemented Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of U.S. federal income tax law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, have been reviewed by us and are accurate and complete in all material respects.
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs 4, 5 and 9 above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with your counsel. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date, and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of March 20, 2007, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents, as of their respective dates of filing with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) nothing came to our attention which gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission as of such date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Final Supplemented Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the date hereof, any untrue statement therein of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and with respect to information set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Series 2007B Senior Notes - Book-Entry Only Issuance - The Depository Trust Company."
The attorneys in this firm that are rendering this opinion are members of the State Bar of Georgia and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of Georgia, the federal law of the United States, the Delaware General Corporation Law and, to the extent set forth herein in numbered paragraphs 4 and 5, the laws of the State of New York.
This opinion is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transaction. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.
Yours very truly,
 
TROUTMAN SANDERS LLP

Series 2007B Floating Rate Extendible Senior Notes
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), in connection with the issuance by The Southern Company (the "Company") of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series 2007B Floating Rate Extendible Senior Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes are being issued under the Senior Note Indenture dated as of January 1, 2007 (the "Original Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo, as trustee (in such capacity, the "Trustee"), as heretofore supplemented and as further supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 28, 2007 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee. Pursuant to a Calculation Agent Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2007 (the "Calculation Agent Agreement"), between the Company and Wells Fargo, as calculation agent thereunder ("Calculation Agent"), the Company has engaged the Calculation Agent to perform certain services with respect to the floating interest rate on the Notes.
For purposes of this opinion, we have reviewed the Indenture and the Calculation Agent Agreement and such other documents, records and papers, and satisfied ourselves as to such other matters, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for this opinion. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied on certificates of Wells Fargo and of public officials. In such review, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies or forms and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have assumed that Wells Fargo has been duly formed and that the Indenture and the Calculation Agent Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitute the valid and binding agreements of, and are enforceable in accordance with their terms against, the Company.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications below, we are of the opinion that:
1)        Based solely on a certificate from the Comptroller of the Currency, Wells Fargo is a national banking association formed under the laws of the United States and is authorized thereunder to transact the business of banking and exercise fiduciary powers.
2)        The Indenture and the Calculation Agent Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Wells Fargo and constitute valid and binding agreements of Wells Fargo enforceable against Wells Fargo in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and by an implied covenant of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and, for purposes of this opinion, do not hold ourselves out as experts on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and the federal law of the United States. The opinions expressed herein are limited to matters governed by the laws of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States.
This opinion is solely for your benefit in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes and may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon or furnished to any other person, without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,

Series 2007B Floating Rate Extendible Senior Notes
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have represented the Underwriters (hereinafter defined) in connection with (i) the issuance and sale by The Southern Company (the "Company") of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series 2007B Floating Rate Extendible Senior Notes (the "Notes") pursuant to a Senior Note Indenture dated as of January 1, 2007, by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as heretofore supplemented and as further supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 28, 2007 (collectively, the "Indenture"); and (ii) the purchase by the Underwriters of the Notes pursuant to the terms of an Underwriting Agreement dated March 20, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and the Underwriters. Pursuant to a Calculation Agent Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2007 (the "Calculation Agent Agreement"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as calculation agent thereunder (the "Calculation Agent"), the Company has engaged the Calculation Agent to perform certain services with respect to the floating interest rate on the Notes. This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(b)(3) thereof.
All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File Nos. 333-138503, 333-138503-01 and 333-138503-02), pertaining to the Notes and certain other securities filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as it became effective under the Act (the "Registration Statement"); the Company's prospectus dated January 11, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus") as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated March 20, 2007 (the "Pricing Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Act, which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company dated January 11, 2007, February 5, 2007 and February 20, 2007 (the "Pricing Exchange Act Documents"), and a prospectus supplement dated March 20, 2007 (together with the Basic Prospectus, the "Final Supplemented Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Pricing Exchange Act Documents and the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company dated March 20, 2007 (the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); and the Indenture. We have also examined the free writing prospectus prepared by the Company and filed with the Commission on March 20, 2007 pursuant to Rule 433 of the Act (the "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus"). The documents listed in Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement, taken together, are collectively referred to as the "Pricing Disclosure Package."
In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing (except the certificate representing the Notes, of which we have examined a specimen), and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
The Indenture, the Calculation Agent Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement are herein referred to collectively as the "Agreements."
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1.         The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct its business as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreements and the Notes.
2.         The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
3.         All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes have been obtained; such orders are sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Notes; the issuance and sale of the Notes conform in all material respects with the terms of such orders; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.
4.         Each of the Calculation Agent Agreement and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee and the Calculation Agent, respectively, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Indenture and the Calculation Agent Agreement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture conforms as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
5.         The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualifications that the enforceability of the Company's obligations under the Notes may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes conform as to legal matters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
6.         The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with counsel to the Company. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Supplemented Prospectus and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date, and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of March 20, 2007, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents, as of their respective dates of filing with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) nothing came to our attention which gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission as of such date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Final Supplemented Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the date hereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and with respect to information set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Series 2007B Senior Notes - Book-Entry Only Issuance - The Depository Trust Company."
We are members of the State Bar of New York and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States and the Delaware General Corporation Law.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent except that Troutman Sanders LLP may rely on this opinion in giving its opinions pursuant to Section 6 of the Underwriting Agreement and to Sections 102, 302 and 904 of the Indenture, insofar as such opinions relate to matters of New York law.

SECTION 103.           
Payment of Principal and Interest
. Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, the principal of the Series 2007B Notes shall be due at the Initial Maturity Date. A Holder of an Extendible Note may elect to extend the maturity of all of the principal amount of its Extendible Note or any portion of its Extendible Note having a principal amount of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof, during the Notice Period relating to each Election Date, in which case the maturity of such principal amount of its Extendible Note shall be extended to the date occurring 366 calendar days from and including the 20
th
calendar day of the next succeeding month following such Election Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day). In no event will the maturity of the Series 2007B Notes be extended beyond the Final Maturity Date.
 
To make an election to extend the maturity of an Extendible Note effective on any Election Date, a Holder must deliver a notice of election during the Notice Period for that Election Date, such notice to be substantially in the form entitled "Notice of Election to Extend Maturity" attached to Exhibit A hereto, duly completed (a "Notice of Election"), and in the event of an election to the extend the maturity of only a portion of the principal amount of such Holder's Extendible Note, such Extendible Note. The Notice Period for each Election Date will begin on the fifth Business Day prior to the Election Date and will end at the close of business, New York City time, on the Election Date (the "Notice Period"). If the Election Date is not a Business Day, the Notice Period will be extended to the Business Day next following the
 
4
 
 
Election Date. A Notice of Election must be delivered to the Trustee on or after the first day of the Notice Period and no later than the close of business, New York City time, on the last Business Day in the Notice Period relating to the applicable Election Date. Upon delivery to the Trustee of a Notice of Election to extend the maturity of a Holder's Extendible Note or any portion thereof during any Notice Period, that Notice of Election will be revocable during each day of such Notice Period, until 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the last Business Day in the Notice Period relating to the applicable Election Date, at which time such Notice of Election will become irrevocable.
 
If on any Election Date, a Holder of an Extendible Note does not make a timely and proper election to extend the maturity of all or any portion of the principal amount of such Holder's Extendible Note, the principal amount of such Extendible Note for which no such election has been made will be due and payable at the Stated Maturity of such Extendible Note. The principal amount of an Extendible Note for which no election to extend the maturity has been made on any Election Date will be represented by a substitute non-extendible note deemed to be issued as of such Election Date, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (a "Substitute Note") and Schedule A to such Extendible Note shall be annotated as of such Election Date to reflect the corresponding decrease in the principal amount thereof. If a Holder of an Extendible Note elects to extend the maturity of only a portion of an Extendible Note, the principal amount of the Substitute Note must be in an authorized denomination as provided in Section 105. The Substitute Note so issued will have the same terms as the original Extendible Note, except that it will not be extendible, it will have a different CUSIP number and its maturity date will remain the Stated Maturity. Interest on the Substitute Note shall accrue from and including the last Interest Payment Date on the related original Extendible Note. The Company and the Trustee shall deem an Extendible Note canceled as to any portion of the principal amount thereof for which a duly completed Notice of Election and, if applicable, such Extendible Note, are not delivered to the Trustee within the Notice Period for any Election Date, except with respect to the entitlement of any interest thereon that is in arrears as of such Election Date.
 
A Holder's failure to elect to extend the maturity of all or any portion of the Series 2007B Notes will be irrevocable and will be binding upon any subsequent Holder of such Series 2007B Notes.
 
The unpaid principal amount of the Series 2007B Notes shall accrue interest at the Coupon Rate set monthly pursuant to Section 104 hereof, from the Original Issue Date, until paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be paid quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to the Person in whose name such Series 2007B Note is registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, whether or not such Regular Record Date is a Business Day. However, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of any Series 2007B Note will be paid to the same Person to whom the principal is payable. The initial Interest Payment Date for the Series 2007B Notes is June 20, 2007. The final Interest Payment Date for a Series 2007B Note shall be the Stated Maturity for that Series 2007B Note. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person or Persons in whose name the Series 2007B Notes are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of the Series 2007B
 
5
 
 
Notes not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Series 2007B Notes shall be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture.
 
The rate at which interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal amount of the Series 2007B Notes for each Interest Period shall be the relevant Coupon Rate for that Interest Period and payments of interest on the Series 2007B Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Such interest shall accrue on the basis of the actual number of days in each Interest Period and a year of 360 days.
 
Interest on the Series 2007B Notes will be payable, in arrears, on each Interest Payment Date, including any Interest Payment Date on which a Holder elects to extend the maturity of any Extendible Note in accordance with the provisions of this Section 103. In the event any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, unless:
 
 
(ii)       the Interest Payment Date that does not occur on a Business Day is also the scheduled Stated Maturity for such Series 2007B Note,
 
in which case, the relevant Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity for the relevant Series 2007B Note, as the case may be, will be the immediately preceding Business Day and interest will accrue to but excluding that immediately preceding Business Day.
 
Payments of the principal and interest due at the Stated Maturity of any Series 2007B Notes shall be made upon surrender of such Series 2007B Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Series 2007B Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer or other electronic transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment to the Person entitled thereto.
 
SECTION 104.           
Determination of Interest Rate
. The Series 2007B Notes will accrue interest for each Interest Period at a per annum rate, subject to a maximum interest rate permitted by New York or other applicable state law, as such law may be modified by United States law of general application (the "Coupon Rate"). The Coupon Rate shall be equal to LIBOR for each Interest Period, as determined by the Calculation Agent, plus the Applicable Spread.
 
Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent will notify the Company and the Trustee, if the Trustee is not then serving as the Calculation Agent, of the Coupon Rate for
 
6
 
 
the new Interest Period. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating the interest rates on the Series 2007B Notes shall be conclusive and binding upon the beneficial owners and Holders of the Series 2007B Notes, the Company and the Trustee, absent manifest error.
 
Upon the request of a Holder of the Series 2007B Notes, the Calculation Agent will provide to such Holder the interest rate in effect on the date of such request and, if determined, the interest rate for the next Interest Period.
 
SECTION 105.           
Denominations
. The Series 2007B Notes may be issued in denominations of $1,000, or any integral multiple thereof.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY
SERIES 2007B FLOATING RATE EXTENDIBLE SENIOR NOTE
 
 
 
The Southern Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof), for value received, hereby promises to pay to_______________________________________________, or registered assigns, the principal sum of _________ DOLLARS ($__________) on the Stated Maturity shown above, and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date shown above, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date as specified above, to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, whether or not such Regular Record Date is a Business Day. However, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of this Note will be paid to the same Person to whom the principal is payable. The initial Interest Payment Date for this Note is June 20, 2007. The final Interest Payment Date for this Note shall be the Stated Maturity. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith
 
A-1
 
 
 
cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of the Series 2007B Notes (as defined on the reverse hereof) not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes of this series shall be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
 
Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, the Stated Maturity will be the Initial Maturity Date. A Holder of the Series 2007B Notes may elect to extend the maturity of all of the principal amount of its Series 2007B Notes or any portion of its Series 2007B Notes having a principal amount of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof, during the Notice Period (as defined below) relating to each Election Date (as defined below), in which case the maturity of such principal amount of its Series 2007B Notes shall be extended to the date occurring 366 calendar days from and including the 20
th
calendar day of the next succeeding month from such Election Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day). In no event will the maturity of the Series 2007B Notes be extended beyond the Final Maturity Date.
 
To make an election to extend the maturity of this Note effective on any Election Date, a Holder must deliver a notice of election during the Notice Period for that Election Date, such notice to be substantially in the form entitled "Notice of Election to Extend Maturity" attached hereto, duly completed (a "Notice of Election"), and in the event of an election to extend the maturity of only a portion of the principal amount of this Note, this Note. The Notice Period for each Election Date will begin on the fifth Business Day prior to the Election Date and will end at the close of business, New York City time, on the Election Date (the "Notice Period"). If the Election Date is not a Business Day, the Notice Period will be extended to the Business Day next following the Election Date. A Notice of Election must be delivered to the Trustee on or after the first day of the Notice Period and no later than the close of business, New York City time, on the last Business Day in the Notice Period relating to the applicable Election Date. Upon delivery to the Trustee of a Notice of Election to extend the maturity of this Note or any portion thereof during any Notice Period, that Notice of Election will be revocable during each day of such Notice Period, until 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the last Business Day in the Notice Period relating to the applicable Election Date, at which time such Notice of Election will become irrevocable.
 
If, on any Election Date, a Holder of this Note does not make a timely and proper election to extend the maturity of all or any portion of the principal amount of this Note, the principal amount of this Note for which no such election has been made will be due and payable at the Stated Maturity. The principal amount of this Note for which no election to extend the maturity has been made on any Election Date will be represented by a substitute, non-extendible note deemed to be issued as of such Election Date, substantially in the form of Exhibit B to the Second Supplemental Indenture to the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof (a "Substitute Note") and Schedule A hereto shall be annotated as of such Election Date to reflect the corresponding decrease in the principal amount hereof. If a Holder of an Extendible Note elects to extend the maturity of only a portion of an Extendible Note, the principal amount of the
 
A-2
 
 
 
Substitute Note must be in an authorized denomination as provided in the Indenture. The Substitute Note so issued will have the same terms as this Note, except that it will not be extendible, it will have a different CUSIP number and its non-extendible maturity date will remain the Stated Maturity. Interest on the Substitute Note shall accrue from and including the last Interest Payment Date on the related original Note. The Company and the Trustee shall deem this Note canceled as to any portion of the principal amount hereof for which a duly completed Notice of Election and, if applicable, this Note, are not delivered to the Trustee within the Notice Period, except with respect to the entitlement to any interest thereon that is in arrears as of the Election Date.
 
A Holder's failure to elect to extend the maturity of all or any portion of this Note will be irrevocable and will be binding upon any subsequent Holder of this Note.
 
The rate at which interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal amount of this Note for each Interest Period (as defined below) shall be the relevant Coupon Rate (as defined below) for that Interest Period and payments of interest on the Series 2007B Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Such interest shall accrue on the basis of the actual number of days in each Interest Period and a year of 360 days.         
 
The Series 2007B Notes will accrue interest for each Interest Period at a per annum rate, subject to a maximum interest rate permitted by New York or other applicable state law, as such law may be modified by United States law of general application (the "Coupon Rate"). The Coupon Rate, as determined by the Calculation Agent, shall be equal to LIBOR (as defined below) for each Interest Period plus the Applicable Spread (as defined below).
 
"Applicable Spread" means: .01% from and including the Original Issue Date but prior to the Interest Payment Date in March 2008; .02% from and including the Interest Payment Date in March 2008 but prior to the Interest Payment Date in March 2009; .03% from and including the Interest Payment Date in March 2009 but prior to the Interest Payment Date in March 2010; .04% from and including the Interest Payment Date in March 2010 but prior to the Interest Payment Date in March 2011; and .05% from and including the Interest Payment Date in March 2011 but prior to the Final Maturity Date.
 
"Business Day" means a day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banks in New York, New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Trustee's corporate trust office is closed for business.

If such rate does not appear on such page at such time, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major reference banks, which may include one or more of the Underwriters (as defined below) or their affiliates, in the London interbank market, selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), to provide such bank's offered quotation to prime banks in the London interbank market for deposits in U.S. dollars in a Representative Amount (as defined below) and for the applicable period referred to below, as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Determination Date. If at least two such quotations are so provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks, which may include one or more of the Underwriters or their affiliates, in The City of New York (after consultation with the Company), to provide such bank's rate to leading European banks for loans in U.S. dollars in a Representative Amount and for the applicable period referred to below, as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such LIBOR Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then LIBOR will be LIBOR in effect during the preceding Interest Period. All percentages resulting from any calculation on a Series 2007B Note will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with a five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards, and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the Series 2007B Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards). The applicable period referred to above is three months, in each case commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period, except that the applicable period referred to above for the final Interest Period for this Note will be (i) one month, if the final Interest Period is a period of one month, (ii) two months, if the final Interest Period is a period of two months, and (iii) three months, if the final Interest Period is a period of three months.

All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating the interest rates on this Note shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders of this Note, the Company and the Trustee, absent manifest error.
 
Interest on this Note will be payable, in arrears, on each Interest Payment Date, including any Interest Payment Date on which a Holder elects to extend the maturity of this Note in accordance with the provisions of this Note. In the event that any Interest Payment is not a Business Day, then the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, unless:
 
 
(ii)       the Interest Payment Date that does not occur on a Business Day is also the scheduled Stated Maturity,
 
in which case, the relevant Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity, for the relevant Series 2007B Note, as the case may be, will be the immediately preceding Business Day and interest will accrue to but excluding that immediately preceding Business Day.
 
Payment of the principal of and interest due at the Stated Maturity of the Series 2007B Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Series 2007B Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

The holder of this Note hereby agrees to treat the Final Maturity Date of this Note as the sole maturity date of this Note for purposes of the United States Treasury Regulations governing modifications to the terms of debt instruments such that an election to extend the maturity of all or any portion of the principal amount of this Note in accordance with its terms is not a taxable event for United States federal income tax purposes with respect to such portion, absent a final administrative or judicial determination to the contrary. The holder of this Note further agrees to file any and all United States federal income tax returns in a manner that is consistent with such United States federal income tax treatment.

Our opinion assumes (i) the accuracy of the facts contained in the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement and other materials examined by us and (ii) the consummation of the offer to sell the Notes in the manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the terms set forth in, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, the discussion contained in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS," subject to the limitations described therein, constitutes the opinion of Troutman Sanders LLP. There can be no assurance that changes in the law will not take place that could affect such United States federal income tax consequences, or that contrary positions may not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service.
