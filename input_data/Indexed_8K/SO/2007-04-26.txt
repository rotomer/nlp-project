On April 26, 2007, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2007. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2007 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Exhibits 99.01, 99.02 and 99.03 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to including earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, also include earnings and earnings per share for such periods excluding the results of Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments. Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments generate tax credits as a result of synthetic fuel production. These tax credits will no longer be available after December 31, 2007. Southern Company management uses earnings per share, excluding synthetic fuel earnings, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company's ongoing business activities.
Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share excluding the results of the synthetic fuel investments also is useful for investors because it provides investors with additional information for purposes of comparing Southern Company's performance for such periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Population growth and robust economy drive
Southern Company's first quarter earnings
 
ATLANTA  Southern Company today reported first quarter earnings of $338.7 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $261.6 million, or 35 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
 
"The population growth in the Southeast is a reflection of our robust regional economy. Economic development in the Southeast is strong, the job market is vibrant, income levels have increased, and our housing market is outperforming the nation as a whole," said David M. Ratcliffe, Southern Company chairman, president and CEO.
 
The result for the company has been increases in residential and commercial customers and electricity usage. Southern Company has added 70,000 customers since the end of the first quarter in 2006, a 1.7 percent increase. Total kilowatt-hour sales to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, grew 6.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with the previous year. These positive earnings drivers were offset in part by higher interest costs.
 
"We maintain our commitment to deliver superior service to customers and excellent results to shareholders. We're excited about the growth in our region and we're committed to investing in our infrastructure to ensure that we maintain high reliability. We're also meeting increasing demand with cleaner electricity by installing new environmental controls at our facilities. And, we're working hard to keep our costs to customers well below the national average," Ratcliffe said.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Excluding the financial impact of the synthetic fuel business, first quarter earnings per share were 41 cents, compared with 34 cents in the first quarter of 2006.
 
Revenues for the first quarter were $3.41 billion, compared with $3.06 billion in the same period a year ago, an 11.3 percent increase.
 
Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 3.3 percent in the first quarter, compared with 2006. Residential electricity use increased 6.4 percent. Electricity use by commercial customers increased 5.1 percent, while industrial sales decreased 1.0 percent.
 
With 4.3 million customers and more than 42,000 megawatts of generating capacity, Atlanta-based Southern Company (NYSE: SO) is the premier energy company serving the Southeast, one of America's fastest-growing regions. A leading U.S. producer of electricity, Southern Company owns electric utilities in four states and a growing competitive generation company, as well as fiber optics and wireless communications.
