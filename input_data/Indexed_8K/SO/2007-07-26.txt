Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
On July 26, 2007, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the periods ended June 30, 2007. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Exhibits 99.01, 99.02 and 99.03 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to including earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the three and six months ended ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, also include earnings and earnings per share for such periods excluding the results of Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments. Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments generate tax credits as a result of synthetic fuel production. These tax credits will no longer be available after December 31, 2007. Southern Company management uses earnings per share, excluding synthetic fuel earnings, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company's ongoing business activities. Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share excluding the results of the synthetic fuel investments also is useful for investors because it provides investors with additional information for purposes of comparing Southern Company's performance for such periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Southern Company's strong second quarter earnings
boosted by customer growth, economy
 
ATLANTA  Southern Company reported second quarter earnings of $429.2 million, or 57 cents per share. The earnings compared with $385.2 million, or 52 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2006.
 
For the six months ended June 30, Southern Company's earnings were $767.8 million, or $1.02 a share, compared with $646.8 million, or 87 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
 
Excluding the impact of synthetic fuel investments, second quarter earnings were 55 cents a share, compared with 52 cents a share in the second quarter of 2006, and earnings for the first six months of 2007 were 97 cents a share, compared with 87 cents a share for the same period in 2006.
 
Positive earnings drivers in the second quarter include customer growth, economic expansion and state regulatory actions. The positive drivers were offset in part by higher operations and maintenance expenses, higher interest expense, asset depreciation primarily associated with increased investment in environmental equipment, and lower margins from commercial and industrial market-based rates.
 
The number of customers served by Southern Company grew 1.6 percent in the past year. The company's customer growth is a reflection of the economy in the Southeast, which continues to attract new residents and businesses. The unemployment rate in the Southeast is currently at 4.1 percent compared with the nation's 4.6 percent. Personal
 
 
 
 
income growth for the first six months of 2007 is 4.4 percent in the Southeast compared with 3.9 percent in the nation.
 
Chairman, President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe said the company remains focused on meeting its goals and the challenges that come with growth in the Southeast. "Our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value and customer satisfaction remains strong," Ratcliffe said. "We continue to focus on meeting the growing electricity needs of our region and providing our customers with reliable, affordable energy and outstanding service."
 
Total revenues for the second quarter were $3.77 billion compared with $3.59 billion in the second quarter of 2006, a 5.0 percent increase. For the first six months of the year, revenues totaled $7.18 billion, compared with $6.65 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 7.9 percent.
 
In the second quarter, kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 0.3 percent compared with sales during the 2006 second quarter. Residential electricity use increased 0.4 percent. Commercial sales increased 1.7 percent and industrial sales declined 1.0 percent. Year-to-date, kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers increased 1.8 percent compared with sales during the same period in 2006. Residential electricity use increased 3.3 percent. Commercial sales increased 3.3 percent and industrial sales declined 1.0 percent.
 
Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 1.2 percent compared with the second quarter last year. Year-to-date, total sales of electricity increased 3.8 percent compared with the same period in 2006.
