Manufacturers Association, the Association For Fairness In Rate Making, the Georgia Municipal Association, the Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority of the Division of Energy Resources, Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority and the United States Department of Defense and all federal agencies, which was filed with the Georgia PSC on November 16, 2007. Under the terms of the 2007 Plan, effective January 1, 2008, Georgia Power's retail base rates will increase by approximately $99.7 million, or approximately $1.55 per month for the average residential customer, to provide for cost recovery of transmission, distribution, generation and other investments, as well as increased operating costs. In addition, an environmental compliance cost recovery ("ECCR") tariff will be implemented to allow for recovery of costs related to environmental controls mandated by state and federal regulations. The ECCR tariff will increase rates by approximately $222 million, or approximately $3.60 per month for the average residential customer.
Under the 2007 Plan, Georgia Power's earnings will be evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10.25% to 12.25%. One-third of earnings above 12.25% will be applied to the ECCR tariff and two-thirds would be applied to rate refunds. Georgia Power will not file for a general base rate increase unless its projected retail return on common equity falls below 10.25%. Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case on July 1, 2010, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the rate order should be continued, modified or discontinued.
