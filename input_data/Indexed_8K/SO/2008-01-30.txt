This combined Form 8-K is furnished separately by six registrants: The Southern Company, Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company and Southern Power Company. Information contained herein relating to each registrant is furnished by each registrant solely on its own behalf. Each registrant makes no representation as to information relating to the other registrants.

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
On January 30, 2008, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.06 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Exhibits 99.01, 99.02 and 99.03 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to including earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, also include earnings and earnings per share for such periods excluding the results of Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments. Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments generated tax credits as a result of synthetic fuel production. These tax credits were no longer available after December 31, 2007. Southern Company management uses earnings per share, excluding synthetic fuel earnings, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company's ongoing business activities. Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share excluding the results of the synthetic fuel investments also is useful for investors because it provides investors with additional information for purposes of comparing Southern Company's performance for such periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Southern Company reports strong 2007 results
Year highlighted by superior operational performance
 
ATLANTA  Citing a resilient economy in the Southeast and a warm summer, Southern Company today reported full-year 2007 earnings of $1.73 billion, or $2.29 a share. Reported earnings for 2006 were $1.57 billion, or $2.12 a share.
 
Southern Company also reported solid fourth quarter earnings of $204.1 million, or 27 cents a share. This compared with reported earnings of $188.4 million, or 25 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
Excluding the impact of synthetic fuel investments, Southern Company earned $2.21 a share in 2007, up from $2.10 a share in 2006, and earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were 26 cents a share, compared with 25 cents a share for the same period in 2006.
 
Low housing costs and job growth continue to attract new residents to the Southeast. Southern Company added more than 55,000 customers in 2007, an increase of 1.3 percent over 2006. Despite a slowdown in the housing market, the Southeast's stronger growth in households and jobs, as compared to the nation's, continues to provide a solid foundation for the Southeastern economy.
 
 
 
 
 
 
During an August heat wave, which was compounded by the ongoing drought, the company set five successive peak records. Despite the prolonged stress that was placed on the system, Southern Company's customers did not experience a single major disruption to service.
 
"Southern Company employees did an outstanding job in 2007, operating at historically high levels of reliability, achieving industry-leading customer satisfaction levels and continuing to offer retail prices well below the national average," said Chairman, President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe. "Our commitment to deliver good results for customers and shareholders is strong and our track record speaks for itself."
 
In addition to weather and the resilient economy, the positive earnings drivers in 2007 include state regulatory actions. The drivers were offset in part by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, higher interest expense, and asset depreciation primarily associated with increased investment in environmental equipment and transmission and distribution related to maintaining reliability in the growing Southeast.
 
Revenues for the full year were $15.35 billion, compared with $14.36 billion in 2006, a 6.9 percent increase. Fourth quarter revenues were $3.34 billion, compared with $3.15 billion in the same period a year earlier, an increase of 6 percent.
 
Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area increased 1.4 percent in 2007, compared with 2006. Residential energy sales increased 1.8 percent. Commercial energy sales increased 3.2 percent. Industrial energy sales declined 0.7 percent.
 
Total energy sales to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 2.3 percent in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily because of customer growth.
 
In conjunction with this earnings announcement, Southern Company has posted on its Web site detailed financial information on its fourth quarter and 2007 performance. These materials are available at www.southerncompany.com.
 
Southern Company's financial analyst call will be at 1 p.m. Eastern time Jan. 30, at which time Ratcliffe and Chief Financial Officer Thomas A. Fanning will discuss earnings and earnings guidance as well as a general business update. Investors, media and the public may listen to a live Webcast of the call at www.southerncompany.com. A replay of the Webcast will be available at the site for 12 months.
