The addresses of the registrants have not changed since the last report.
 
This combined Form 8-K is filed separately by two registrants: The Southern Company and Alabama Power Company. Information contained herein relating to each registrant is filed by each registrant solely on its own behalf. Each registrant makes no representation as to information relating to the other registrant.
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrants under any of the following provisions:
 
 
See BUSINESS  "Rate Matters  Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" of The Southern Company ("Southern Company") in Item 1 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  "PSC Matters  Alabama Power" and "PSC Matters  Fuel Cost Recovery" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and BUSINESS  "Rate Matters  Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" of Alabama Power Company ("Alabama Power") in Item 1 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  "PSC Matters  Retail Fuel Cost Recovery" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 for information regarding the rate structure and design and the retail rate plans of Alabama Power. For additional information, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  "FERC and Alabama PSC Matters  Retail Fuel Cost Recovery" in Alabama Power's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
On October 7, 2008, the Alabama Public Service Commission (the "APSC") voted to approve an increase in Alabama Power's Rate Energy Cost Recovery ("ECR") factor to 3.983 cents per kilowatt hour ("KWH") for a 24-month period beginning with October 9, 2008 billings. Thereafter, the Rate ECR factor shall be 5.910 cents per KWH, absent a contrary order by the APSC. Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, this approved increase in the billing factor will have no significant effect on revenues or net income, but will increase annual cash flow.

The APSC also voted to approve a corrective rate package effective in January 2009 providing for various adjustments to customer charges under Alabama Power's rate structure which are expected to generate additional annual revenues of $168 million. Alabama Power expects that these additional revenues will preclude the need for a rate adjustment under the Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan ("Rate RSE") in 2009. At the October 7, 2008 meeting of the APSC, Alabama Power agreed to a moratorium on any increase in 2009 under Rate RSE.
Alabama Power also agreed to defer collection during 2009 of any increase in rates under the portion of Rate Certificated New Plant which permits recovery of costs associated with environmental laws and regulations.
