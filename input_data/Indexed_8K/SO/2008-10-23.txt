This combined Form 8-K is furnished separately by six registrants: The Southern Company, Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company and Southern Power Company. Information contained herein relating to each registrant is furnished by each registrant solely on its own behalf. Each registrant makes no representation as to information relating to the other registrants.
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
On October 23, 2008, The Southern Company ("Southern Company") issued a press release regarding its earnings for the periods ended September 30, 2008. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2008 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.07 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Exhibits 99.01, 99.02 and 99.03 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to including earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, also include earnings and earnings per share for such period excluding a significant charge related to the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" and FASB Staff Position No. 13-2, "Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction" to Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases. The charge related to Southern Company's investments in leveraged lease transactions significantly impacted the presentation of earnings and earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, and significant charges related to these investments are not expected to occur on a regular basis. Exhibits 99.01, 99.02, 99.03 and 99.04 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to including earnings and earnings per share in accordance with GAAP for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2007, also include earnings and earnings per share for such periods excluding the results of Southern Company's synthetic fuel investments, which claimed federal income tax credits. The availability of synthetic fuel tax credits and Southern Company's investment in these activities ended on December 31, 2007. Southern Company management uses earnings per share, excluding synthetic fuel earnings and excluding the effect of the charge related to the leveraged lease investments, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company's ongoing business activities. Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share, excluding the results of the synthetic fuel investments and the effect of the charge related to the leveraged lease investments, also is useful for investors because it provides investors with additional information for purposes of comparing Southern Company's performance for such periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Southern Company third quarter positive
despite economic challenges, mild weather
 
ATLANTA  Southern Company reported third quarter earnings of $780.4 million, or $1.01 a share. The earnings compared with $762.0 million, or $1.00 a share, in the third quarter of 2007.
 
Earnings for the first nine months of 2008 were $1.56 billion, or $2.02 a share, compared with $1.53 billion, or $2.03 a share, for the same period a year ago.
 
Earnings for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008, included a $67 million charge, or 9 cents per share, related to three leveraged leases from the 1990s when Southern Company pursued development of international energy projects. Earnings for the third quarter and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2007, included synthetic fuel earnings of 1 cent per share and 7 cents per share, respectively.
 
Excluding the impact of synthetic fuel investments, Southern Company earned $1.01 a share for the third quarter of 2008, compared with 99 cents a share for the same period in 2007. Excluding the impact of synthetic fuel investments and charges related to the leveraged leases, earnings for the first nine months of 2008 were $2.11 a share, compared with $1.96 a share for the same period in 2007.
 
Revenues for the third quarter were $5.43 billion compared with $4.83 billion in the third quarter of 2007, a 12.3 percent increase. For the first nine months of the year, revenues totaled $13.32 billion, compared with $12.01 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 10.9 percent.
 
Chairman, President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe said that despite the challenges of mild weather, a sluggish economy and turmoil in the financial markets, Southern Company's businesses continued to perform well overall in the third quarter, giving the company positive results and keeping the company on track to deliver on its financial and operational goals for the year.
 
 
"We remain committed to the strategy that has provided our customers with reliable energy and outstanding service at prices below the national average and that has rewarded investors, even in challenging times," Ratcliffe said.
 
The economy in the Southeast continues to experience the same stress as other regions of the country, but to a lesser degree. While customer growth has slowed, it is still positive. Southern Company is serving more than 28,000 additional customers, compared with the same time last year. This growth partially offset a decrease in usage.
 
Positive third-quarter earnings drivers include increased retail rates and revenues from market-response rates offered to commercial and industrial customers. These positive drivers were primarily offset by mild summer temperatures as compared to the same period in 2007, and asset depreciation primarily associated with increased investment in environmental equipment and transmission and distribution equipment. These investments are needed to produce cleaner energy and maintain reliability.
 
In the third quarter, kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area decreased 4.6 percent compared with sales during the 2007 third quarter. Residential electricity sales decreased 7.6 percent. Commercial sales decreased 2.3 percent and industrial sales declined 3.4 percent. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, are down 2.5 percent compared with the third quarter last year. The major contributor to the decrease in third-quarter sales was the milder weather as compared to the same period last year.
 
For the first nine months of 2008, kilowatt-hour sales to Southern Company's retail customers decreased 1.7 percent compared with sales during the same period in 2007. Residential electricity sales decreased 3.4 percent, commercial sales are unchanged and industrial sales declined 1.6 percent as compared with the first nine months of 2007. Total sales of electricity to Southern Company's customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, are down 0.4 percent compared with the first nine months of last year.
 
With 4.4 million customers and more than 42,000 megawatts of generating capacity, Atlanta-based Southern Company (NYSE: SO) is the premier energy company serving the Southeast. A leading U.S. producer of electricity, Southern Company owns electric utilities in four states and a growing competitive generation company, as well as fiber optics and wireless communications. Southern Company brands are known for excellent customer service, high reliability and retail electric prices that are significantly below the national average. Southern Company has been listed the top ranking U.S. electric service provider in customer satisfaction for nine consecutive years by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI).
