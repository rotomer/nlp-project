such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission which was made in such Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or Final Supplemented Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by BNYMCM for use therein. BNYMCM agrees, within ten days after the receipt by it of notice of the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought by it, or by any person controlling it, from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 6.01, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof but the omission of BNYMCM so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to BNYMCM or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.01. In case any such action shall be brought against BNYMCM or any such person controlling BNYMCM and BNYMCM shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in (and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel, to direct) the defense thereof, at its own expense.

In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY
Common Stock
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to The Southern Company (the "Company") in connection with the Company's proposed issuance of not to exceed 20,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, $5 par value per share (the "Shares"), as contemplated by (i) the Sales Agency Financing Agreement dated as of May 8, 2009 (the "Agreement"), between the Company and BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and (ii) the Sales Agency Financing Agreement dated as of May 8, 2009 (the "Alternative Sales Agency Agreement"), between the Company and Barclays Capital Inc.
All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159072) pertaining to the Shares and certain other securities filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as it became effective under the Act (the "Registration Statement"); the Company's prospectus dated May 8, 2009 (the "Basic Prospectus") as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated May 8, 2009 (the "Final Supplemented Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Act which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 200
o
(the "Form 10-K"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarters ended [ ] and the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company dated [ ] (the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); and the Agreement and the Alternative Sales Agency Agreement.
In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and on the date of this opinion, and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents
 
B-

NY3 3010214.11 191960 000001 5/8/2009 02:51pm
submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1.
            
The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreement and to issue the Shares.
2.
            
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
3.
            
All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares have been obtained; and no order, consent or other authorization or approval of the State of Georgia or any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
4.
            
The Shares have been duly authorized for issuance and sale and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Agreement against payment of the consideration and as provided in the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
5.
            
The Shares conform as to legal maters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
6.
            
The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares do not, and, if the Company were now to perform its obligations under the Agreement, such performance would not, result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K or any subsequent Exchange Act Document, (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
7.
            
The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares, will not be an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Deloitte & Touche LLP shall deliver a letter or letters addressed to BNYMCM (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the BNYMCM) dated the respective dates of delivery thereof to the effect that: (A) they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations under the Securities Act; (B) in their opinion, the financial statements audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act; and (C) on the basis of certain limited procedures performed through a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, namely (i) reading the minute books of the Company; (ii) performing the procedures specified by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of interim financial statement information as described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, "Interim Financial Information," on the unaudited financial statements, if any, of the Company incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, and on the latest available unaudited financial statements of the Company, if any, for any calendar quarter subsequent to the date of those incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable; and (iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding such unaudited financial statements or any specified unaudited amounts derived therefrom (it being understood that the foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments made in such letter, and accordingly that Deloitte & Touche LLP make no representations as to the sufficiency of such procedures for the BNYMCM's purposes), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (1) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, for them to be in conformity with GAAP; (2) such unaudited condensed financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; (3) any unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings Before Income Taxes, Consolidated Net Income and Consolidated Net Income After Dividends on Preferred and Preference Stock of Subsidiaries and any unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (4) as of a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there has been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any decrease in net assets as compared with amounts shown in the latest unaudited balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, except in each case for changes or decreases which (i) the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, disclose have

Barclays agrees, within ten days after the receipt by it of notice of the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought by it, or
 
18
 
 
by any person controlling it, from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 6.01, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof but the omission of Barclays so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to Barclays or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.01. In case any such action shall be brought against Barclays or any such person controlling Barclays and Barclays shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in (and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel, to direct) the defense thereof, at its own expense.

No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent.
(b)
   
Indemnification by Barclays
.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY
Common Stock
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to The Southern Company (the "
Company
") in connection with the Company's proposed issuance of not to exceed 20,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, $5 par value per share (the "
Shares
"), as contemplated by (i) the Sales Agency Financing Agreement dated as of May 8, 2009 (the "
Agreement
"), between the Company and Barclays Capital Inc. and (ii) the Sales Agency Financing Agreement dated as of May 8, 2009 (the "
Alternative Sales Agency Agreement
"), between the Company and BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC.
All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159072) pertaining to the Shares and certain other securities filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
Act
"), as it became effective under the Act (the "
Registration Statement
"); the Company's prospectus dated May 8, 2009 (the "
Basic Prospectus
") as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated May 8, 2009 (the "
Final Supplemented Prospectus
"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission
") under the Act which, pursuant to Form S-3, incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 200
o
(the "
Form 10-K
"), the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarters ended [ ] and the Current Reports on Form 8-K of the Company dated [ ] (the "
Exchange Act Documents
"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
Exchange Act
"); and the Agreement and the Alternative Sales Agency Agreement.
In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and on the date of this opinion, and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of
 
B-

all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1.         The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreement and to issue the Shares.
2.         The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
3.         All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares have been obtained; and no order, consent or other authorization or approval of the State of Georgia or any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
4.         The Shares have been duly authorized for issuance and sale and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Agreement against payment of the consideration and as provided in the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
5.         The Shares conform as to legal maters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
6.         The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares do not, and, if the Company were now to perform its obligations under the Agreement, such performance would not, result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K or any subsequent Exchange Act Document, (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government,

governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
7.         The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares, will not be an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 5 above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with your counsel. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, on the [date on which it became effective][date of the filing of the Form 10-K](the "
Effective Date
"), and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of _____________, 200_, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents, as of their respective dates of filing with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) we confirm to you that nothing came to our attention which gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission as of such date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Supplemented Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the date hereof, any untrue statement therein of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents.
The attorneys in this firm that are rendering this opinion are members of the State Bar of Georgia and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of Georgia, the federal law of the United States and the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Exhibit C
 
Deloitte & Touche LLP shall deliver a letter or letters addressed to Barclays (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Barclays) dated the respective dates of delivery thereof to the effect that: (A) they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations under the Securities Act; (B) in their opinion, the financial statements audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act; and (C) on the basis of certain limited procedures performed through a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, namely (i) reading the minute books of the Company; (ii) performing the procedures specified by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of interim financial statement information as described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, "Interim Financial Information," on the unaudited financial statements, if any, of the Company incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, and on the latest available unaudited financial statements of the Company, if any, for any calendar quarter subsequent to the date of those incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable; and (iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding such unaudited financial statements or any specified unaudited amounts derived therefrom (it being understood that the foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments made in such letter, and accordingly that Deloitte & Touche LLP make no representations as to the sufficiency of such procedures for the Barclays's purposes), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (1) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, for them to be in conformity with GAAP; (2) such unaudited condensed financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; (3) any unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings Before Income Taxes, Consolidated Net Income and Consolidated Net Income After Dividends on Preferred and Preference Stock of Subsidiaries and any unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (4) as of a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there has been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any decrease in net assets as compared with amounts shown in the latest unaudited balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, except in each case for changes or decreases which (i) the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, disclose

have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs under existing pollution control financing arrangements, (iv) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (v) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, (vi) are occasioned by the reclassification of current maturities of long-term debt, or (vii) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) any unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and any unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which, if available, shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding audited amounts or ratios included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to The Southern Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the above-referenced Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-159072) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the registration pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 20,000,000 shares (the "Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $5 per share, for issuance pursuant to (i) the Sales Agency Financing Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2009, between the Company and BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC (the "BNY Agreement") and (ii) the Sales Agency Financing Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2009, between the Company and Barclays Capital Inc. (together with the BNY Agreement, the "Agreements").
 
In rendering this opinion, we have examined the Registration Statement, the Agreements and copies of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, each as certified to us by an officer of the Company. We also have reviewed minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the issuance and sale of the Shares and such other documents as we have deemed necessary for purposes of this opinion. In such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on all original documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the original documents of all copies submitted to us, the authenticity of the originals of documents submitted to us as copies and the due execution and delivery of all documents where due execution and delivery are prerequisite to the effectiveness thereof.
 
Based upon the foregoing examination, we are of the opinion that, subject to compliance with the pertinent provisions of the Securities Act and to compliance with such securities or "Blue Sky" laws of any jurisdiction as may be applicable, when the Shares have been issued in accordance with the terms of the Agreements, the Shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
