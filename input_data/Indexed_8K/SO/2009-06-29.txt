SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
 
Washington, D. C. 20549
 
FORM 8-K
 
CURRENT REPORT
 
Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 
 
 
The names and addresses of the registrants have not changed since the last report.
 
This combined Form 8-K is filed separately by two registrants: The Southern Company and Georgia Power Company. Information contained herein relating to each registrant is filed by each registrant solely on its own behalf. Each registrant makes no representation as to information relating to the other registrant.
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrants under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  "PSC Matters" of The Southern Company ("Southern Company") and Georgia Power Company ("Georgia Power") in Item 7 of each company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 ("Form 10-K") for a discussion of Georgia Power's three-year retail rate plan for 2008 to 2010 as approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission ("PSC") in December 2007 (the "Retail Rate Plan"). Also see Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" and "Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal" in Item 8 of each company's Form 10-K for information on other cost of removal obligations.
Under the Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power's earnings are evaluated against a retail return on equity ("ROE") range of 10.25% to 12.25%. In connection with the Retail Rate Plan, the Georgia PSC ordered that Georgia Power file its next general base rate case by July 1, 2010; however, the Retail Rate Plan provides that Georgia Power may file for a general base rate increase in the event its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25%.
The economic recession has significantly reduced Georgia Power's revenues upon which retail rates were set under the Retail Rate Plan. Despite stringent efforts to reduce expenses, current projections indicate Georgia Power's retail ROE will be less than 10.25% in both 2009 and 2010. However, in lieu of filing to increase customer rates as allowed under the Retail Rate Plan, on June 29, 2009, Georgia Power filed a request with the Georgia PSC for an accounting order (the "Accounting Order Request") that would allow Georgia
Power to amortize approximately $324 million of its regulatory liability related to other cost of removal obligations. Under Georgia Power's proposal, the regulatory liability would be amortized ratably over the 18-month period from July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010 as a reduction to operating expenses.
Even if the Georgia PSC approves the Accounting Order Request as filed, Georgia Power currently expects its retail ROE will remain below the 10.25% low end of its allowed retail ROE range in 2009 and 2010. However, if the Georgia PSC approves the Accounting Order Request as filed, Georgia Power currently estimates it will be able to stay on schedule to file its next base rate case on July 1, 2010.
The Accounting Order Request is subject to the review and approval of the Georgia PSC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
