Due to the previously announced resignation of Mr. Francis S. Blake from the Board of Directors of The Southern Company (the "Company") effective as of October 7, 2009, the Company temporarily has only two members on its Audit Committee. On October 12, 2009, the Company received notice from NYSE Regulation, Inc., an affiliate of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), that, as a result of Mr. Blake's resignation, the Company was deficient in meeting the requirements of Section 303A.07(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which requires the audit committee of NYSE-listed companies to have a minimum of three members. The notice stated that the Company would be noncompliant if it was not able to cure the deficiency by October 19, 2009.
It is intended that the Board of Directors will appoint a third member to the Audit Committee at its regularly-scheduled board meeting on Monday, October 19, 2009, which will eliminate this deficiency.
SIGNATURE
