In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and on the date of this opinion, and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the
 
 
 
 
opinions hereinafter set forth.  In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreement and to issue the Shares.
 
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
 
3.           All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares have been obtained; and no order, consent or other authorization or approval of the State of Georgia or any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
 
4.           The Shares have been duly authorized for issuance and sale and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Agreement against payment of the consideration and as provided in the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
5.           The Shares conform as to legal maters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
 
6.           The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares do not, and, if the Company were now to perform its obligations under the Agreement, such performance would not, result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K or any subsequent Exchange Act Document, (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government,
 
 
 
 
governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
7.           The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares, will not be an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs under existing pollution control financing arrangements, (iv) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (v) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, (vi) are occasioned by the reclassification of current maturities of long-term debt, or (vii) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) any unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and any unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which, if available, shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding audited amounts or ratios included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable.

18 
 
 
any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent.

In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and on the date of this opinion, and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the
 
 
 
 
opinions hereinafter set forth.  In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreement and to issue the Shares.
 
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
 
3.           All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares have been obtained; and no order, consent or other authorization or approval of the State of Georgia or any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
 
4.           The Shares have been duly authorized for issuance and sale and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Agreement against payment of the consideration and as provided in the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
5.           The Shares conform as to legal maters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
 
6.           The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares do not, and, if the Company were now to perform its obligations under the Agreement, such performance would not, result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K or any subsequent Exchange Act Document, (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government,
 
 
 
 
governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
7.           The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares, will not be an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 5 above.  In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with your counsel.

have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs under existing pollution control financing arrangements, (iv) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (v) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, (vi) are occasioned by the reclassification of current maturities of long-term debt, or (vii) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) any unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and any unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which, if available, shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding audited amounts or ratios included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable.

In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreement and to issue the Shares.
 
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.

4.           The Shares have been duly authorized for issuance and sale and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Agreement against payment of the consideration and as provided in the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
5.           The Shares conform as to legal maters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
 
6.           The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares do not, and, if the Company were now to perform its obligations under the Agreement, such performance would not, result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K or any subsequent Exchange Act Document, (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government,

In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel, the Sales Agent or controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Sales Agent or such controlling person, unless (i) the Company has authorized in writing the retention of such counsel or (ii) the Sales Agent or such controlling person reasonably concludes that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Company, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such claim or action or separate but substantially similar or related claims or actions arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the
 
 
18
 
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent.
 
(b)
 
.  The Sales Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and such of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to alleged untrue statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or such documents as amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Sales Agent for use therein.

In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and on the date of this opinion, and we have made such other and further investigations as we deemed necessary to express the
 
 
 
 
opinions hereinafter set forth.  In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.           The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has due corporate authority to conduct the business in which it is engaged, to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreement and to issue the Shares.
 
2.           The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
 
3.           All orders, consents or other authorizations or approvals of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares have been obtained; and no order, consent or other authorization or approval of the State of Georgia or any United States governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the provisions of the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
 
4.           The Shares have been duly authorized for issuance and sale and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Agreement against payment of the consideration and as provided in the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
5.           The Shares conform as to legal maters in all material respects to the description thereof in the Final Supplemented Prospectus.
 
6.           The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement and the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares do not, and, if the Company were now to perform its obligations under the Agreement, such performance would not, result in any violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company under (A) any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that has been filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K or any subsequent Exchange Act Document, (B) any existing applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company (other than the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) or (C) any judgment, order or decree known to us of any government,
 
 
 
 
governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, or any regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
7.           The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares, will not be an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 5 above.  In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with your counsel.  Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, on the [date on which it became effective][date of the filing of the Form 10-K](the ), and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as of _____________, 200_, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents, as of their respective dates of filing with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the relevant requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) we confirm to you that nothing came to our attention which gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission as of such date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Final Supplemented Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained, as of its date, or contains, on the date hereof, any untrue statement therein of a material fact or omitted, as of its date, or omits, on the date hereof, to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Supplemented Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents.

Exhibit B
Deloitte & Touche LLP shall deliver a letter or letters addressed to the Sales Agent (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Sales Agent) dated the respective dates of delivery thereof to the effect that:  (A) they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations under the Securities Act; (B) in their opinion, the financial statements audited by them and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act; and (C) on the basis of certain limited procedures performed through a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, namely (i) reading the minute books of the Company; (ii) performing the procedures specified by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of interim financial statement information as described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited financial statements, if any, of the Company incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, and on the latest available unaudited financial statements of the Company, if any, for any calendar quarter subsequent to the date of those incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable; and (iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding such unaudited financial statements or any specified unaudited amounts derived therefrom (it being understood that the foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments made in such letter, and accordingly that Deloitte & Touche LLP make no representations as to the sufficiency of such procedures for the Sales Agents purposes), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:  (1) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed financial statements, if any, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, for them to be in conformity with GAAP; (2) such unaudited condensed financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; (3) any unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings Before Income Taxes, Consolidated Net Income and Consolidated Net Income After Dividends on Preferred and Preference Stock of Subsidiaries and any unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; (4) as of a specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of delivery of such letter, there has been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any decrease in net assets as compared with amounts shown in the latest audited or unaudited balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, except in each case for changes or decreases which (i) the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable, disclose
 
 
 
 
have occurred or may occur, (ii) are occasioned by the declaration of dividends, (iii) are occasioned by draw-downs under existing pollution control financing arrangements, (iv) are occasioned by draw-downs and regularly scheduled payments of capitalized lease obligations, (v) are occasioned by the purchase or redemption of bonds or stock to satisfy mandatory or optional redemption provisions relating thereto, (vi) are occasioned by the reclassification of current maturities of long-term debt, or (vii) are disclosed in such letter; and (5) any unaudited amounts for Operating Revenues, Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Earnings from Continuing Operations and Net Income and any unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and unaudited Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends for any calendar quarter subsequent to those set forth in (3) above, which, if available, shall be set forth in such letter, do not agree with the amounts set forth in or derived from the unaudited financial statements for the same period or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding audited amounts or ratios included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, as applicable.

Incorporated.
In rendering this opinion, we have examined the Registration Statement, the Agreements and copies of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, each as certified to us by an officer of the Company.

In such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on all original documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the original documents of all copies submitted to us, the authenticity of the originals of documents submitted to us as copies and the due execution and delivery of all documents where due execution and delivery are prerequisite to the effectiveness thereof.
 
Based upon the foregoing examination, we are of the opinion that, subject to compliance with the pertinent provisions of the Securities Act and to compliance with such securities or Blue Sky laws of any jurisdiction as may be applicable, when the Shares have been issued in accordance with the terms of the Agreements, the Shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
