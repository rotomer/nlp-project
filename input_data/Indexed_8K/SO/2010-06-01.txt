On May 10, 2010, Mississippi Power filed a motion in response to the April 29, 2010 order of the Mississippi Public Service Commission (the Mississippi PSC) relating to the Kemper IGCC, or in the alternative, for alteration or rehearing of such order.  In its motion, Mississippi Power responded to the order and proposed alternatives to the conditions contained in the order.  In its motion, Mississippi Power proposed, among other things, an alternate construction cost cap of $2.88 billion, modified prudence review procedures, and a modified proposal for financing cost recovery on construction work in progress (CWIP) balances under the State of Mississippi Baseload Act of 2008 (the Baseload Act), which would provide for the accrual of allowance for funds used during construction in 2010 and 2011 and recovery of financing costs on 100% of CWIP in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
On May 26, 2010, the Mississippi PSC issued an order revising its findings from the April 29, 2010 order.  Among other things, the Mississippi PSCs May 26, 2010 order (1) approved the alternate construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, subject to determinations by the Mississippi PSC that such costs in excess of $2.4 billion are prudent and required by the public convenience and necessity; (2) provided for the establishment of operational cost and revenue parameters based upon assumptions in Mississippi Powers proposal; and (3) approved financing cost recovery on CWIP balances under the Baseload Act, which provides for the accrual of allowance for funds used during construction in 2010 and 2011 and recovery of financing costs on 100% of CWIP in 2012, 2013, and through May 1, 2014 (provided that the amount of CWIP allowed is (i) reduced by the amount of government construction cost incentives received by Mississippi Power in excess of $296 million to the extent that such amount increases cash flow for the pertinent regulatory period and (ii) justified by a showing that such CWIP allowance will benefit customers over the life of the plant).  The Mississippi PSC order established periodic prudence reviews during the annual CWIP review process.  More frequent prudence determinations may be requested at a later time.  On May 27, 2010, Mississippi Power filed a motion with the Mississippi PSC accepting the conditions contained in the order.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.
