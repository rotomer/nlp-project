Item 2.02                      Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section.  Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
On July 28, 2010, The Southern Company (Southern Company) issued a press release regarding its earnings for the periods ended June 30, 2010.  A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  In addition, certain additional information regarding the financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 is being furnished as Exhibits 99.02 through 99.07 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Exhibits 99.01, 99.02 and 99.03 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, in addition to including earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the six months ended June 30, 2009, also include earnings and earnings per share for such period excluding the charge related to a settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC (MCAR) to resolve litigation arising out of the 2003 bankruptcy of Mirant Corporation (Mirant), a Southern Company subsidiary until its April 2001 spin-off.  The charge related to the settlement agreement with MCAR significantly impacted the presentation of earnings and earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2009, and significant charges related to the Mirant spin-off are not expected to occur in the future.  Accordingly, Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share excluding the charge related to the MCAR settlement agreement is useful to investors because it provides investors with additional information to evaluate the performance of Southern Companys ongoing business activities.  Southern Company management also uses earnings and earnings per share excluding the charge related to the settlement agreement with MCAR to evaluate the performance of Southern Companys ongoing business activities.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The exhibits hereto contain business segment information for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company and Southern Power Company.  Accordingly, this report is also being furnished on behalf of each such registrant.
The following exhibits relate to the periods ended June 30, 2010:

ATLANTA  Southern Company (NYSE: SO) today reported second quarter earnings of $510.2 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with $478.6 million, or 61 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2009.
For the six months ended June 30, Southern Companys earnings were $1.0 billion, or $1.22 a share, compared with $604.3 million, or 77 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2009, included a charge of 26 cents a share, or $202 million,  related to a settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery LLC to resolve a lawsuit arising out of the 2003 bankruptcy of Mirant Corp., a Southern Company subsidiary until its 2001 spin-off.  Excluding the impact of the 2009 settlement, Southern Company earned $1.22 a share for the first six months of 2010, compared with $1.03 a share for the same period in 2009.
Weather was a primary factor driving earnings, as the Southeast experienced one of the warmest second quarters in more than a century. The economic recovery contributed positively to earnings. Industrial sales, which were up 13 percent for the second quarter compared to the same period in 2009, reflect improvement in industrial activity in the Southeast.
We continue to see positive economic trends, particularly among our industrial and manufacturing customers, said Chairman, President and CEO David M. Ratcliffe. Our businesses continued to perform well overall in the second quarter, giving us solid results and keeping the company on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals for the year.
Revenues associated with the recovery of investments in environmental equipment and reduced depreciation and amortization also contributed positively to second quarter earnings. The positive earnings drivers were partially offset by an increase in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, reflecting a return to normal ongoing levels as the economic recovery continues. Other negative earnings drivers include an income decrease as a result of a gain in the second quarter of 2009 related to the early termination of two international leveraged-lease investments and an increase in the number of Southern Company shares outstanding.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenues for the second quarter of 2010 were $4.21 billion, compared with $3.89 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 8.3 percent. For the first six months of the year, revenues totaled $8.36 billion, compared with $7.55 billion in the same period a year ago, a 10.8 percent increase.
In the second quarter, kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Companys four-state service area increased 6.4 percent, compared with the second quarter of 2009. Residential electricity sales increased 5.8 percent. Electricity sales to commercial customers increased 1.7 percent, and industrial sales increased 13.0 percent.
Year-to-date, kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers increased 8.4 percent compared with sales during the first six months of 2009. Residential electricity sales increased 13.3 percent. Electricity sales to commercial customers increased 2.5 percent, and industrial sales increased 9.9 percent.
Total energy sales to Southern Companys customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales, increased 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009. Year-to-date, total sales of electricity increased 7.2 percent as compared with the same period in 2009.
