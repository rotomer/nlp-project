For additional information, see MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  PSC Matters  Georgia Power of Southern Company and MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL  PSC Matters  Rate Plans of Georgia Power in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under Retail Regulatory Matters  Georgia Power  Retail Rate Plans and Retail Regulatory Matters  Rate Plans, respectively, in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
On December 21, 2010, the Georgia PSC voted to approve an Alternate Rate Plan for Georgia Power effective January 1, 2011 and continuing through December 31, 2013 (the 2010 ARP).  The terms of the 2010 ARP reflect the settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) among Georgia Power, the Georgia PSCs Public Interest Advocacy Staff (the Staff), and the Commercial Group, which was filed with the Georgia PSC on November 19, 2010 and, subsequently, was also signed by the Association for Fairness in Ratemaking, the Georgia Industrial Group, the Georgia Traditional Manufacturers Association, Kgen Power Management, Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Sterling Planet, and the United States Department of Defense and all federal agencies (collectively with Georgia Power, the Staff, and the Commercial Group, the Stipulating Parties).
Under the terms of the 2010 ARP, effective January 1, 2011, Georgia Power will (1) increase the traditional base tariff rates by approximately $347.2 million; (2) collect an additional $31.6 million through the Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs; (3) collect an additional $167.8 million through the Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff; and (4) collect an additional 2.16% of Georgia Powers total revenues (or $15.7 million), through the Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariff, for a total increase in base revenues of approximately $562.3 million, or $10.76 per month for the typical residential customer.
Under the 2010 ARP, no separate Certified Capacity Cost Recovery tariff will be created.  However, the following additional rate adjustments will be made to Georgia Powers tariffs in 2012 and 2013:
Georgia Power currently estimates these adjustments will result in base revenue increases of approximately $189.7 million in 2012 and $92.6 million in 2013, representing increases of approximately $3.08 per month and $1.48 per month for the typical residential customer in 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Under the 2010 ARP, Georgia Powers retail return on common equity (ROE) will be set at 11.15%, and earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25% will be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power.  There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 10.25% on an actual basis and no separate Adjustable Cost Recovery tariff will be created.  However, if at any time during the term of the 2010 ARP, Georgia Power projects that retail earnings will be below 10.25% for any calendar year, it may petition the Georgia PSC for the implementation of an Interim Cost Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Powers earnings back to a 10.25% ROE.  The Georgia PSC will have 90 days to rule on any such request.  If approved, any ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2014 or the end of the calendar year in which the ICR tariff becomes effective.  In lieu of requesting implementation of an ICR tariff, or if the Georgia PSC chooses not to implement the ICR, Georgia Power may file a full rate case.
Except as provided above, Georgia Power will not file for a general base rate increase while the 2010 ARP is in effect.  Georgia Power is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2013, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2010 ARP should be continued, modified or discontinued.

On December 21, 2010, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Powers NCCR tariff, as authorized under the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act.  The tariff will become effective January 1, 2011 to collect approximately $223 million of financing costs associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
