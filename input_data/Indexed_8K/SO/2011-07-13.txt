On July 12, 2011, the Alabama Public Service Commission (the APSC) issued an order to eliminate a tax-related adjustment under Alabama Powers rate structure effective with billings beginning October 1, 2011.  Alabama Power anticipates the elimination of this adjustment will result in additional revenues of approximately $30 million for the remainder of 2011, and with an annual effect beginning in 2012 of approximately $150 million.
In accordance with the order, Alabama Power will make additional accruals to the Natural Disaster Reserve (NDR) in the fourth quarter 2011 of an amount equal to such additional 2011 revenues to replenish the NDR which was impacted as a result of operations and maintenance expenses incurred in connection with the April 2011 devastating storms in Alabama.  Alabama Power expects that these additional revenues will preclude the need for a
 
 
 
 
 
 
rate adjustment under Rate Stabilization and Equalization (Rate RSE).  Accordingly, Alabama Power agreed to a moratorium on any increase in 2012 under Rate RSE.
