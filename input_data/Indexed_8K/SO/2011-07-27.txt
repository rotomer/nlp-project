ATLANTA  Southern Company (NYSE: SO) today reported second quarter earnings of $603.3 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $510.2 million, or 62 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
 
For the six months ended June 30, Southern Companys earnings were $1.03 billion, or $1.20 a share, compared with $1.00 billion, or $1.22 a share, for the same period a year ago.
 
Revenues for the second quarter were $4.52 billion, compared with $4.21 billion for the same period a year ago, a 7.5 percent increase. For the first six months of the year, revenues were $8.53 billion, compared with $8.36 billion for the same period last year, a 2.0 percent increase.
 
Earnings were positively influenced by regulatory actions at Georgia Power that became effective
Jan. 1, 2011, including cash recovery of financing costs related to Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4 that is expected to save Georgia Power customers approximately $300 million. Earnings were further positively influenced by continued strength in manufacturing exports, as well as improved results at the companys Southern Power subsidiary.
 
Earnings were negatively affected by higher depreciation and amortization  including reduced amortization of the cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power that helped offset the need for a rate request in 2009  as well as an increase in the number of Southern Company outstanding shares.

We believe our region is well positioned for future expansion, and we are already seeing new business development in several parts of our service territory.
