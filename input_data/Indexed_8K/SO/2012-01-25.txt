Southern Company reports 2011 fourth quarter and full-year earnings
ATLANTA -- Southern Company today reported fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $261 million, or 30
cents a share, compared with earnings of $153 million, or 18 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Southern Company also reported full-year 2011 earnings of $2.20 billion, or $2.57 a share, compared with
earnings for 2010 of $1.97 billion, or $2.37 a share.
Earnings for the quarter and the full year were positively influenced by regulatory actions -- primarily at subsidiary Georgia Power -- that became effective in 2011, as well as operating results at Southern Power, Southern Companys competitive generation subsidiary. Earnings were negatively affected by weather that was closer to normal in 2011 than it had been in 2010.
In a year filled with challenges, our employees continued to deliver results on behalf of the customers and communities we serve, said Thomas A. Fanning, Southern Company chairman, president and chief executive officer. They are helping to fulfill Southern Companys $20 billion commitment to build the energy future of the Southeast, a process that is expected to grow more than 250,000 jobs, according to analysis by the University of West Georgia.
Fanning noted that economic conditions in the region are improving, albeit slowly. We see a still-challenged economy that is exhibiting sustained industrial growth alongside flat commercial and residential growth, he said. In recent weeks, positive signs have emerged in the form of job growth and lower unemployment rates. Meanwhile, the future looks bright, as companies continue to show avid interest in locating and expanding their businesses here in the Southeast.
Revenues for the full year were $17.66 billion, compared with $17.46 billion in 2010, a 1.2 percent
increase. Fourth quarter revenues were $3.70 billion, compared with $3.77 billion for the same period in
2010, a decrease of 2.0 percent.
Kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers in Southern Company's four-state service area decreased 2.7
percent in 2011, compared with 2010. Residential energy sales decreased 7.7 percent, commercial energy
sales decreased 2.9 percent and industrial energy sales increased 3.2 percent.
Total energy sales to Southern Companys customers in the Southeast, including wholesale sales,
decreased 3.4 percent in 2011 compared with 2010.
