(b) OPTION UNDERWRITTEN SECURITIES. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Companies may grant, if so provided in the applicable Terms Agreement, an option to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, to purchase up to the number of the Option Underwritten Securities set forth therein at a price per Option Underwritten Security equal to the price per Initial Underwritten Security, less an amount equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Companies and paid or payable on the Initial Underwritten Securities but not payable on the Option Underwritten Securities.

(n) INCLUSION IN S&P 500 INDEX. At Closing Time, SPG shall have been included in the S&P 500 Index by Standard and Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies. SECTION 6. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) INDEMNIFICATION OF UNDERWRITERS. The Companies and the Operating Partnership agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: - 22 -
(1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; PROVIDED, that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Companies; and (3) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Companies by any Underwriter through Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (b) INDEMNIFICATION OF COMPANIES, OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Companies and the Operating Partnership, each of the Companies' directors, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Companies or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Companies by such Underwriter through Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) ACTIONS AGAINST PARTIES; NOTIFICATION. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially - 23 -
prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Companies. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) SETTLEMENT WITHOUT CONSENT IF FAILURE TO REIMBURSE. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with the provisions hereof, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(2) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into in good faith by the indemnified party more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. SECTION 7. CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Companies and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Companies and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Companies and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Companies and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, or, if Rule 434 is used, the corresponding location on the Term - 24 -
Sheet bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Companies and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Companies or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Companies, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriter were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Companies, each officer of the Companies who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Companies or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Companies. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Initial Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement and not joint. SECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Companies or authorized representatives of the Operating Partnership submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Companies or the Operating Partnership, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities. - 25 -
SECTION 9. TERMINATION. (a) UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT. This Underwriting Agreement (excluding the applicable Terms Agreement) may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Companies or by Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney upon the giving of 30 days' prior written notice of such termination to the other party hereto. (b) TERMS AGREEMENT. Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney may terminate the applicable Terms Agreement, by notice to the Companies, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time or any relevant Date of Delivery, if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Companies and the other Simon Entities considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or internationally or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof, the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis, or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial, or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Companies has been suspended or limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or in the over-the-counter market has been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by either of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal, New York or Delaware authorities, (v) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States has occurred or (vi) if Preferred Stock is offered and the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any preferred shares of the Companies as of the date of the applicable Terms Agreement shall have been downgraded since such date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has placed any series of Preferred Stock of the Companies under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, as to the rating of such Preferred Stock or any of the Companies' other securities. (c) LIABILITIES. If this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 13 hereof shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect. SECTION 10. DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: - 26 -
(a) if the number or aggregate amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters named in such Terms Agreement shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the number or aggregate amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement (or, with respect to the Underwriters' exercise of any applicable over-allotment option for the purchase of Option Underwritten Securities on a Date of Delivery after the Closing Time, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase, and the Companies to sell, such Option Underwritten Securities on such Date of Delivery) shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in (i) a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Date of Delivery after the Closing Time, a termination of the obligations of the Underwriters and the Companies with respect to the related Option Underwritten Securities, as the case may be, each of Goldman, Salomon Smith Barney and the Companies shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. SECTION 11. NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

EXHIBIT B -2 FORM OF OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL TO COMPANIES AND OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(b) (1) Each of the Companies has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the State of Delaware. (2) Each of the Companies has the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under, or as contemplated under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement. For purposes of this opinion, such counsel has assumed that the business in which the Companies are engaged or propose to engage consists of the business of (i) a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (ii) owning partnership interests and other equity interests in subsidiary entities, (iii) acting as a general partner and/or limited partner in subsidiary partnerships, and (iv) providing management, leasing, accounting, design, and construction expertise through its own personnel or through outside professionals. (3) The Operating Partnership has been duly organized and is validly existing as a limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business in which it is engaged or proposes to engage as described in the Prospectus. (4) At the time the Registration Statement became effective, and at each of the Representation Dates, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, excluding (a) the documents incorporated by reference therein and (b) the financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data that are included or incorporated by reference therein, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. In passing upon compliance as to the form of such documents, such counsel has assumed that the statements made or incorporated by reference therein are complete and correct. (5) The documents filed pursuant to the 1934 Act and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules therein and other financial data, as to which no opinion need be rendered), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. In passing upon compliance as to the form of such documents, such counsel has assumed that the statements made or incorporated by reference therein are complete and correct. (6) The information in the Prospectus under "Important Federal Income Tax Considerations" and any description of the Underwritten Securities included therein, and such other information in the Prospectus Supplement or in any Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Companies as may be agreed upon from time to time by the Companies, Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney, to the extent that it purports to summarize matters of law, descriptions of statutes, rules or regulations, summaries of legal matters, the Companies' organizational documents and documents or legal proceedings, or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by them, is correct and presents fairly the information required to be disclosed therein in all material respects; and such opinion set forth under "Important Federal Income Tax Considerations," in the Prospectus, is confirmed. B-2-1
(7) The Companies satisfy all conditions and requirements for filing the Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act and 1933 Act Regulations. (8) None of the Simon Entities or the Property Partnerships is required to be registered under the 1940 Act. (9) The Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement were duly and validly authorized by the Companies. The Underwriting Agreement was duly and validly authorized by the Operating Partnership. Any one of the Co-Chairmen of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary, or any Assistant Secretary of the Companies (hereinafter, collectively, the "Authorized Officers") has been duly authorized to execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement, for itself and on behalf of the Operating Partnership, and the applicable Terms Agreement. Assuming each has been executed and delivered by any one of the Authorized Officers, the Underwriting Agreement and Terms Agreement are duly and validly executed and delivered by the Companies and the Underwriting Agreement is duly and validly executed and delivered by the Operating Partnership. (10) The Underwritten Securities being sold pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement have been duly authorized for issuance and sale to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and, when issued and delivered by the Companies pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement against payment of the consideration set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The issuance of the Underwritten Securities being sold pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement is not subject to any preemptive or other similar rights arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the charter or the by-laws of the Companies. (11) Each of the Underwritten Securities conforms in all material respects to the statements relating thereto that are contained in the Prospectus. (12) The authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Companies are as set forth in the Prospectus Supplement in the column entitled "Historical Adjusted" under the caption "Capitalization" (except for subsequent issuances thereof, if any, contemplated under the Underwriting Agreement, or as described as reserved for issuance below). Such shares of capital stock have been duly authorized and validly issued by the Companies and are fully paid and non-assessable, and have been offered and sold in compliance with all applicable laws of the State of Delaware and, to such counsel's knowledge, none of such shares of capital stock were issued in violation of preemptive or other similar rights. To such counsel's knowledge, no shares of capital stock of the Companies are reserved for any purpose except in connection with (i) the Stock Plans, (ii) the Distribution Reinvestment Plan, and (iii) the possible issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of SPG Series A Preferred Shares, SPG Series B Preferred Shares, and SPG Series C Preferred Shares, upon the exchange of OP Units or upon the conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock or Class C Common Stock. To the knowledge of such counsel, except for OP Units, shares of Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, and stock options issued under the Stock Plans and except as described in the Prospectus, there are no outstanding securities convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of the Companies, and except for options under the Stock Plans, there are no outstanding options, rights (preemptive or otherwise) or warrants to purchase or to subscribe for shares of such stock or any other securities of the Companies. (13) The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement and compliance by the Companies with their obligations B-2-2
thereunder do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under (i) any provisions of the organizational documents of the Companies; any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation of Delaware; or (iii) to such counsel's knowledge, any Delaware order or Delaware administrative or court decree, binding upon the Companies or to which the Companies are subject, except in each case for conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults that in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect. (14) The information in the Prospectus under "The Securities," "Description of the Warrants," "Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer" and in Part II of the Registration Statement under "Indemnification of Directors and Officers", and such other information in the Prospectus Supplement as may be agreed upon from time to time by the Companies, Goldman and Salomon Smith Barney to the extent that such information constitutes matters of Delaware law, descriptions of Delaware statutes, rules or regulations, summaries of Delaware legal matters, the Companies' organizational documents or Delaware legal proceedings, or legal conclusions of Delaware law, has been reviewed by them and is correct in all material respects. (15) SPG has, at all times since the effective date of its election to be taxed as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code, been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code. Its proposed organization structure will permit it to remain so qualified. At the Underwriters' request, Baker & Daniels shall also confirm to the Underwriters that it has been informed by the staff of the Commission that the Registration Statement is effective under the 1933 Act and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission. In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Companies and the independent public accountants for the Companies at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. On the basis of such participation and review, but without independent verification by such counsel of, and without assuming any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that would lead them to believe that the Registration Statement (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included therein as to which such counsel need not make any statement), at the time the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto (including the filing of the Companies' Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission) became effective or at the date of the applicable Terms Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for financial statements and the schedules and other financial data included therein as to which we make to statement), at the time the Prospectus was issued, at the time any such amended or supplemented Prospectus was issued or at the Closing Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Companies, the Operating Partnership and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to B-2-3
legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). B-2-4

Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as counsel to Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SPG"), and SPG Realty Consultants, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SRC" and together with SPG, the "Companies"), in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Act"), pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-68938 and 333-68938-01) of the Companies (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), of up to $500,000,000 aggregate offering price of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Depository Shares and/or Warrants. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, as modified by the Terms Agreement dated as of June 26, 2002 (the "Agreement"), and among the Companies and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., the Companies propose to issue and sell under the Registration Statement, 9,000,000 shares of Common Stock of SPG, each share of which is paired with a beneficial interest in 1/100 of a share of common stock of SRC (the "Paired Shares"). All capitalized terms used herein have their respective meaning set forth in the Registration Statement unless otherwise stated.
th
        We have examined the Registration Statement, the Certificates of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Companies, minutes of the proceedings of the Companies' Boards of Directors authorizing the issuance of the Paired Shares, and such other documents as we have considered necessary. We have also examined a Certificate of the Secretary of the Companies dated the date hereof (the "Certificate"). In such examination, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have executed any of the aforesaid documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity with originals of all documents submitted to us as copies (and the authenticity of the originals of such copies), and that all public records reviewed are accurate and complete. As to factual matters, we have relied on the certifications, statements or representations of the Companies (including the Certificate) and have not independently verified the matters stated therein.
        Based upon the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion and so advise you that upon the issuance and delivery of the Paired Shares in accordance with the terms set forth in the Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement that are part of the Registration Statement and the Agreement, the Paired Shares will have been duly and validly authorized and will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
        This opinion letter is solely for the use of the Companies in connection with the Registration Statement. This opinion may not be relied on by any other person or in any other connection without our prior written approval. This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no other opinion should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
        We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to us under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus which are parts of the Registration Statement. In giving our consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

We have further assumed that, except for any exceptions set forth in the representation letter described in the following paragraph, the statements and descriptions of the Companies', the Operating Partnership's, the Management Companies' and the Subsidiary Partnerships' businesses, properties, and intended activities as described in the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated therein by reference are accurate and complete.
        For purposes of rendering the opinions expressed herein, we also have assumed, with your consent, the accuracy of the representations contained in the letter from SPG to us. These representations relate to the classification and operation of each of the REIT members as a REIT and the organization and operation of the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies.
        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
        1.    SPG has been organized and has operated in a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
        2.    SPG has been organized and has operated in a manner, as described in the Registration Statement and as represented by the Companies, so as remain qualified as a REIT.
        3.    The information in the Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus under the captions "Important Federal Income Tax Considerations" fairly summarizes the federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Shares.
        This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Further, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the Registration Statement may affect the conclusions stated herein. Moreover, SPG's qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon its ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, requirements under the Code regarding income, distributions and diversity of stock ownership. Because the satisfaction of these requirements will depend upon future events, no assurance can be given that the actual results of its operations for any one taxable year will satisfy the tests necessary to qualify as or be taxed as a REIT under the Code.
        This opinion is furnished to you solely for use in connection with the Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 8 to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the captions "Important Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Prospectus Supplement and in the Prospectus which are parts of the Registration Statement. In giving this consent we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
        We express no opinions as to any federal income tax issue or other matter except those set forth or confirmed above.
