FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaOctober 31, 2002...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002. Diluted funds from operations for the quarter increased 14.3% to $186.1 million from $162.8 million in 2001. On a per share basis, the increase was 8.0% to $0.94 per share from $0.87 per share in 2001. Net income available to common shareholders increased to $58.9 million from $36.3 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.32 per share as compared to $0.21 in 2001.
        Diluted funds from operations for the nine months increased 12.2% to $502.2 million from $447.5 million in 2001. On a per share basis, the increase was 9.2% to $2.61 per share from $2.39 per share in 2001. Net income available to common shareholders increased to $262.1 million from $103.9 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share for the nine months were $1.47 as compared to $0.60 in 2001.
        Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at September 30, 2002 was 91.9% as compared to 90.6% at September 30, 2001. Total retail sales per square foot were $385 per square foot at September 30, 2002 compared to $378 at September 30, 2001, while comparable retail sales per square foot were $391 per square foot compared to $380 at September 30, 2001. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $30.37 per square foot at September 30, 2002, an increase of $1.34 or 4.6%, from September 30, 2001. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during the first nine months of 2002 was $39.96, an increase of $7.81 or 24.3% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired.
        Major factors driving results for the quarter and nine months:
 - 
The Company's core mall portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations. Tenant occupancy, sales and average base rents have increased over prior-year levels, and rental releasing spreads are consistent with historical experience.
 - 
The portfolio of assets acquired from Rodamco North America, N.V. on May 3rd has contributed to profitability and is performing consistent with original underwriting expectations.
 - 
The Company has also benefited from the lower interest rate environment on its variable rate debt. Borrowing costs have also been reduced through the refinancing of expiring debt.
        "The benefits of owning a high-quality mall portfolio have never been more evident than during 2002," said David Simon, Chief Executive Officer. "Our property fundamentals are holding firm in this challenging economy, confirming the stability of our portfolio."
Third Quarter Activities
Capital Markets:
        At the close of financial trading on June 25, 2002, the Company was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. In connection with the addition, the Company completed a 9 million share offering of common stock to partially satisfy the needs of index funds. The public offering price was $35.94 per share or $0.06 less than the closing price on June 25, 2002. Net proceeds of approximately $322 million were received on July 1, 2002 and were used to pay down indebtedness under the Rodamco acquisition credit facility.
        On August 21st, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., completed the sale of $500 million of debt securities. The issue included two tranches of senior unsecured notes: $150 million of 5.375% Notes due 2008 and $350 million of 6.350% Notes due 2012. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the remaining $100 million outstanding balance of the unsecured acquisition facility that was used to finance a portion of SPG's acquisition of assets from Rodamco and to reduce the outstanding balance of the Company's unsecured corporate credit facility. Prior to the offering, the Company entered into a 10-year rate lock transaction at 4.03%, reducing the total weighted average effective borrowing cost for the offering to 5.89%.
        On September 16th, the Company completed a 10-year asset financing totaling $394 million at a fixed interest rate of 6.2%. Assets securitized by the financing include nine regional malls and one community center. Net proceeds were used to pay off 13 existing mortgage loans totaling $395.4 million (weighted average interest rate on $337.7 million of the debt was 6.9%; the remaining $57.7 million was at LIBOR + 1.0%).
Acquisitions:
        One of the assets in the Rodamco acquisition was a / interest in Copley Place, an urban mixed-use project in Boston. The retail component of Copley Place, anchored by Neiman Marcus, is 92% occupied and generates sales in excess of $640 per square foot. On July 19, Simon acquired the remaining / interest from an institutional investor for $118.3 million plus the pro rata share of property-level debt. The cap rate on in-place income for this acquisition was 10.4%.
