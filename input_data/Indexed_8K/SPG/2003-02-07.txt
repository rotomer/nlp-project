Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.
        At December 31, 2002, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 246 properties which consisted of regional malls, community shopping centers and office and mixed-use properties (mixed-use properties include a combination of retail, office space or hotel components) containing an aggregate of 185 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 36 states and eight assets in Europe and Canada.
        On January 13, 2002, the Company announced a joint agreement with The Rouse Company and Westfield America Trust to purchase the assets of Rodamco North America N.V. (RNA). The transaction was completed on May 3, 2002. The portfolio acquired by the Company consists primarily of interests in 13 high-quality, highly productive regional malls in the United States, as well as ownership interests in other real estate assets. The Company's share of the gross RNA consideration was approximately $1.6 billion, including the assumption of $579 million of property-level debt and preferred units.
        Effective December 31, 2002, SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. was merged into the Company, ending the "paired share" REIT structure that the Company had gained from its 1998 combination with Corporate Property Investors, Inc. Although SPG Realty Consultants was able to conduct activities which are not customary for a real estate investment trust, changes in laws since 1998 significantly reduced the need for a paired share REIT structure. Many of the activities previously conducted through SPG Realty Consultants are now conducted through various taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") of the Company.
        Subsequent to year-end 2002, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., acquired all of the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. The interests acquired consist of 95% of the voting common stock of MSM and approximately 3% of the economic interests of MSM. MSM is now a wholly owned TRS of Simon Property Group, L.P.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of December 31, 2002, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements contained in this Supplemental Package may constitute "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may affect the business and prospects of the Company and the Operating Partnership. We direct you to the Company's various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for a detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties.
        We hope you find this Supplemental Package beneficial. Any questions, comments or suggestions should be directed to: Shelly J. Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations-Simon Property Group, P.O. Box 7033, Indianapolis, IN 46207. Telephone: (317) 685-7330; e-mail: sdoran@simon.com

Management believes that EBITDA is an effective measure of shopping center operating performance because it is industry practice to evaluate real estate properties based on operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is generally equivalent to EBITDA; and it is unaffected by the debt and equity structure of the property owner. However, EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States; should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance; is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Excludes technology initiatives.
(3)
Includes net gains from the sale of real estate of $162.0 million, or approximately $0.66 per share.
(4)
Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income and earnings per share. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means consolidated net income without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from extraordinary items and gains or losses on the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion, based on economic ownership interest, of funds from operations of unconsolidated joint ventures, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
(5)
Includes mall and freestanding stores.
(6)
Includes all Owned GLA.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 - 
Diluted funds from operations for the quarter increased 11% to $232.9 million from $209.9 million in 2001. On a per share basis, the increase was 4.5% to $1.17 per share from $1.12 per share in 2001.
 - 
Net income available to common shareholders increased 119% for the quarter to $96.3 million from $43.9 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share increased 108% to $0.52 per share from $0.25 in 2001.
 - 
Diluted funds from operations for the twelve months increased 12% to $734.7 million from $657.1 million in 2001. On a per share basis, the increase was 8.0% to $3.79 per share from $3.51 per share in 2001.
 - 
Net income available to common shareholders for the twelve months increased 142% to $358.4 million from $147.8 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share for the twelve months increased 134% to $1.99 as compared to $0.85 in 2001.
        Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income and earnings per share. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at December 31, 2002 was 92.7% as compared to 91.9% at December 31, 2001. Comparable retail sales per square foot increased 2% to $391 as compared to $383 at December 31, 2001, while total retail sales per square foot increased 2% to $386 at December 31, 2002 as compared to $378 at December 31, 2001. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $30.70 per square foot at December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.42 or 5%, from December 31, 2001. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during 2002 was $40.35, an increase of $7.77 or 24% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired.
        Major factors driving results for the quarter and twelve months:
 - 
The Company's regional mall portfolio continues to demonstrate its stability and strength, with occupancy 80 basis points above the year-earlier period and average base rents 5% higher. Releasing spreads also held firm at 24% for the year.
 - 
The portfolio of assets acquired from Rodamco North America, N.V. on May 3rd has contributed to profitability and is performing consistent with expectations.
 - 
The lower interest rate environment afforded the Company the opportunity to refinance $1.28 billion of maturing mortgage debt in 2002 at a weighted average interest rate of 5.68%.
 - 
The above positive factors were partially offset by the dilutive impact of the sale of 17 non-core assets during 2002 and the issuance of 9 million shares of common stock in June of 2002.
        "The year 2002 was one of the most active in the Company's history," said David Simon, chief executive officer. "We acquired nine assets for $1.6 billion in the Rodamco transaction, sold 17 non-core assets for total consideration including debt of $589 million, refinanced $1.28 billion of mortgage debt, and issued $500 million of bonds. Our portfolio continues to perform well in a difficult economic environment, as evidenced by the improvement of all of our operating metrics in 2002.
        "We're very pleased to have delivered a 24% total return to our shareholders in 2002, significantly outperforming the broader markets. We are also delighted to announce a 9.1% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.55 to $0.60 per share. This increase is indicative of the confidence we have in our business going forward."

        As the exclusive non-alcoholic beverage vendor for mall space controlled by Simon Property Group in its mall and community center properties, Coca-Cola will have promotional and exclusive vending rights within the common areas of Simon properties in the United States.
        As David Simon stated in the initial announcement, "This agreement further validates our strategy of positioning the mall as an outstanding marketing opportunity and we're delighted to be partnering
with Coca-Cola. Our properties give Coca-Cola the ability to interact one-on-one with their millions of U.S. consumers in a comfortable environment. Coca-Cola will be able to leverage Simon's advertising network and a variety of interactive marketing platforms to engage customers in a truly unique and differentiated way. For Coca-Cola, this multi-faceted partnership is an effective way to engage their customers and for us, it further demonstrates the marketing value of the Simon mall franchise."

Earnings Estimates
        The Company also announced today that its current business plan for 2003 is in line with the current Wall Street consensus FFO estimate of $4.01 per share.
        This guidance is based on management's view of current market conditions in the regional mall business. Estimates of future FFO and future earnings per share are, and certain other matters discussed in this press release may be, deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
        Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the national, regional and local economic climate, competitive market forces, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, and changes in market rates of interest. The reader is directed to the Company's various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, reports on Form 8-K and annual reports on Form 10-K for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties.
        Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income and earnings per share. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means consolidated net income without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from extraordinary items and gains or losses on the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion, based on economic ownership interest, of funds from operations of unconsolidated joint ventures, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
