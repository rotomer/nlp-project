Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.
        At March 31, 2003, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 242 properties which consisted of regional malls, community shopping centers and office and mixed-use properties (mixed-use properties include a combination of retail, office space or hotel components) containing an aggregate of 183 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 36 states and nine assets in Europe and Canada.
        On January 1, 2003, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., acquired the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. The interests acquired consist of 95% of the voting common stock of MSM and approximately 3% of the economic interests of MSM. MSM is now a wholly owned TRS of the Operating Partnership.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of March 31, 2003, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements contained in this Supplemental Package may constitute "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may affect the business and prospects of the Company and the Operating Partnership.

Management believes that Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") is an effective measure of shopping center operating performance because it is industry practice to evaluate real estate properties based on operating income before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is generally equivalent to EBITDA; and it is unaffected by the debt and equity structure of the property owner. However, EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance; is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. See Reconciliation of EBITDA to Operating Income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure on page 15.
(2)
Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income and earnings per share. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means consolidated net income without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from extraordinary items and gains or losses on the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion, based on economic ownership interest, of funds from operations of unconsolidated joint ventures, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. See Reconciliation of Net Income to Funds from Operations, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on page 53.

Market value of Common Stock, Units and all issues of Preferred Stock of the Company.
        On the following two pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data intended to report the Company's economic ownership of the entire Simon Group portfolio. While these combined statements were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, we believe they reflect the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
Basis of Presentation:    
The combined amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company.
The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property by property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
GAAP Operating Profit Margin
EBITDA.
  We believe that there are several important factors that contribute to our ability to increase rent and improve the profitability of our shopping centers, including aggregate tenant sales volume, sales per square foot, occupancy levels, tenant occupancy costs, and tenant mix. Each of these factors has a significant effect on EBITDA. The schedules above set forth total EBITDA and reconcile EBITDA to operating income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The schedules also set forth the operating profit margin of our Portfolio calculated using EBITDA and also calculated using operating income instead of EBITDA ("GAAP operating profit margin").

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaMay 7, 2003...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.
 - 
Net income available to common shareholders increased 84% for the quarter to $55.1 million from $30.0 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share increased 71% to $0.29 per share from $0.17 in 2002.
 - 
Diluted funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter increased 22% to $177.4 million from $145.3 million in 2002. On a per share basis, the increase was 16% to $0.89 per share from $0.77 per share in 2002. In compliance with Regulation G, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning non-GAAP financial measures, the Company revised funds from operations for the first three months of 2003 and 2002, in accordance with the definition of FFO provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company now includes the fair market value of in-place leases, calculated in full accordance with SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in funds from operations. The impact of the fair market value of in-place leases is primarily the result of the Rodamco acquisition completed in May of 2002 which contributed approximately $1.9 million of FFO in the first quarter of 2003. In addition, the Company restated funds from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2002 to reflect its share of impairment of technology assets, reducing FFO by $4.2 million, or slightly less than $0.02 per share.
        Funds from Operations is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at March 31, 2003 was 91.7% as compared to 90.9% at March 31, 2002. Comparable retail sales per square foot increased 2% to $390 as compared to $383 at March 31, 2002, while total retail sales per square foot increased 2% to $386 at March 31, 2003 as compared to $377 at March 31, 2002. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $31.28 per square foot at March 31, 2003, an increase of $1.77 or 6%, from March 31, 2002. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during the first three months of 2003 was $45.57, an increase of $12.26 or 37% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired.
Major factors driving results for the quarter:
 - 
The Company's core business continued to perform well as evidenced by regional mall occupancy 80 basis points above the year-earlier period and average base rents 6% higher.
 - 
The portfolio of assets acquired from Rodamco North America, N.V. on May 3, 2002 continues to contribute to profitability.
 - 
The favorable interest rate environment has provided opportunities to refinance existing debt at lower rates.
        "Our primary goal for 2003 is the improvement of our operating margins through increases in rental rates on new lease executions, increases in portfolio occupancy, and a continued focus on utilizing our economies of scale to drive down operating costs," said David Simon, chief executive officer. "We made healthy progress toward that goal during the first quarter and remain focused on our strategy to enhance our core portfolio."
New Development Projects
        The Company has two new development projects currently under construction:
 - 
Las Vegas Premium Outlets is a 435,000 square foot premium manufacturers' outlet shopping center. This will be the Company's second / joint venture with Chelsea Property Group. The center is under construction on a 39-acre parcel near downtown Las Vegas, located at Interstate 15 and US route 95/93 at Charleston Boulevard. The site is one of the most visible locations in Las Vegas, approximately 10 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip. The center will offer shoppers the area's largest collection of upscale outlet stores. Scheduled opening: August 2003.

 - 
Chicago Premium Outlets is the third development to be undertaken jointly by Simon and Chelsea. Also a / joint venture, the site is approximately 35 miles west of downtown Chicago on Interstate 88, also known as the East-West Tollway, in Aurora, Illinois. This premium manufacturers' outlet shopping center will comprise 438,000 square feet. Scheduled opening: Summer 2004.

The project included an entire mall renovation plus an expansion that added Houston's first Nordstrom, a flagship Foley's, 228,000 square feet of small shops and two parking decks. Total project cost was $144 million, of which SPG's share was $45 million. The anticipated stabilized rate of return for the project is 10%.
Dispositions
        The Company's disposition efforts continued in the first quarter with the sale of a portfolio of assets on January 9, 2003. Memorial Mall in Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Mounds Mall and Cinema in Anderson, Indiana; and Richmond Square in Richmond, Indiana were sold for $34 million. On April 29, the Company sold Forest Village Park Mall in Forestville, Maryland for $20.5 million.
th
Acquisitions
        On March 14, 2003, the Company purchased the remaining ownership interest in The Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, Nevada for $174 million in cash, and assumed the minority limited partner's share of existing debt and other partnership liabilities. The acquisition was funded with borrowings on the Company's corporate credit facility.
        The Forum Shops is one of the top retail destinations in the world with annual tenant sales in excess of $1,100 per square foot and traffic of 54,000 shoppers daily. The Company also started construction during the quarter on a 175,000-square-foot expansion of The Forum Shops affronting Las Vegas Boulevard, which will add multilevel luxury retail and restaurants.
Financing Activities
        On March 18, 2003, the Company announced that its partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., completed the sale of $500 million of debt securities. The issue included two tranches of senior unsecured notes: $300 million of 4.875% Notes due 2010 and $200 million of 5.450% Notes due 2013.
        Including the effect of hedging activities, the all-in effective yield is 4.67% for the seven-year notes, 5.19% for the ten-year notes and a blended effective yield of 4.88% for the entire offering. Net proceeds from the offering were primarily used to pay down Simon Property Group, L.P.'s unsecured credit facility. The transaction was priced on March 13, 2003.
Dividends
        Today the Company also announced a common stock dividend of $0.60 per share. This dividend will be paid on May 30, 2003 to shareholders of record on May 16, 2003.
        Solely for purposes of satisfying U.S. federal income tax withholding obligations under section 1.1445-8 of the federal income tax regulations with respect to payments to non-U.S. shareholders, the Company will characterize $0.1956 of this distribution as a capital gain dividend to reflect the taxable composition of its 2002 distributions. This characterization is relevant only for purposes of withholding on payments to non-U.S. shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2003, and is not relevant to U.S. shareholders. The Company also declared dividends on its three public issues of preferred stock, all payable on June 30, 2003 to shareholders of record on June 16, 2003:
 - 
Simon Property Group, Inc. 6.50% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (NYSE:SPGPrB)$1.625 per share

        Certain matters discussed in this press release may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
        Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the national, regional and local economic climate, competitive market forces, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, and changes in market rates of interest. The reader is directed to the Company's various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, reports on Form 8-K and annual reports on Form 10-K for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties.
        Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income and earnings per share. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means
consolidated net income without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from extraordinary items and gains or losses on the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion, based on economic ownership interest, of funds from operations of unconsolidated joint ventures, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

We amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.

2003 results reflect the acquisition of assets from Rodamco North America N.V. on May 3, 2002. The portfolio acquired by Simon consists primarily of interests in 13 high-quality, highly productive regional malls in the United States.

On January 1, 2003, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., acquired all of the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. MSM is now a wholly owned consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of Simon Property Group, L.P. As of January 1, 2003, financial results of MSM are reported on the consolidated method. New line items on the Statements of Operations as a result of the consolidation are: Management fees and other revenue, Home and regional office costs, General and administrative expense, and Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries. In prior years, a portion of Home and regional office costs and General and administrative expense incurred by MSM was allocated to the consolidated properties and reported as Property operating expense. Effective with the consolidation of MSM, this allocation is eliminated in 2003 and the allocations in 2002 have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Home and regional office costs include salary and benefits, office rent, office expenses and information services expenses incurred in the Company's home office and regional offices. General and adminstrative expense represents the costs of operating as a public company and includes such items as stock exchange fees, public and investor relations expenses, executive officers' compensation expenses, audit fees, and legal fees.

(J)
Discontinued Joint Venture Partnership Interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold or consolidated. Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires additional ownership
