Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.
        At June 30, 2003, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 238 properties which consisted of regional malls, community shopping centers and office and mixed-use properties (mixed-use properties include a combination of retail, office space or hotel components) containing an aggregate of 183 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 36 states and nine assets in Europe and Canada.
        On January 1, 2003, the Operating Partnership acquired the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. The interests acquired consist of 95% of the voting common stock of MSM and approximately 3% of the economic interests of MSM. MSM is now a wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of June 30, 2003, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.

Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) net income and earnings per share. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is consolidated net income without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from extraordinary items and gains or losses on the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion, based on economic ownership interest, of funds from operations
of unconsolidated joint ventures, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Includes mall and freestanding stores
(3)
Includes all Owned GLA.
(4)
Represents only those tenants who report sales.
(5)
Based upon the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers which includes only mall and freestanding stores less than 10,000 square feet.

Includes our share of gains on land sales of $15.0 million and $8.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively and $20.8 million and $17.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(8)
Funds from operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2002 were restated to reflect the Company's share of impairment of technology assets and gains on debt-related transactions previously reported as extraordinary under GAAP, reducing FFO by a net $20.4 million, or $0.08 per share for the quarter, and a net $24.6 million, or $0.10 per share for the six months.

        On the following three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data intended to report the Company's economic ownership of the entire Simon Group portfolio. While these combined statements were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, we believe they reflect the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation:
    The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company.
        The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property by property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaJuly 31, 2003...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) today announced diluted funds from operations ("FFO") per share of $0.96, a 19% increase, and diluted earnings per share of $0.26, a 73% decline, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003.
        Net income available to common shareholders totaled $50.3 million in the second quarter of 2003 as compared to $173.2 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share for the period was $0.26 as compared to $0.97 in 2002, a 73% decline. The decline in net income is attributable to net gains on the sale of real estate, primarily the Company's interests in five "Mills-type" properties and a premium outlet center, recognized in the second quarter of 2002. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $105.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 as compared to $203.2 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share for the six months was $0.56 as compared to $1.16 in 2002, a 52% decline, attributable to the same asset sales.
        Diluted FFO was $0.96 per share in the second quarter of 2003 as compared to $0.81 in 2002 (as restated), a 19% increase. Diluted FFO was $196.9 million as compared to $152.6 million in 2002. Diluted FFO was $374.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 as compared to $297.9 million in 2002. On a per share basis, diluted FFO for the six months was $1.85 as compared to $1.57 in 2002 (as restated), an 18% increase. The Company restated FFO for the second quarter and six months of 2002 in full accordance with the definition of FFO provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to comply with Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning non-GAAP financial measures.
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at June 30, 2003 was 91.6% as compared to 91.5% at June 30, 2002. Comparable retail sales per square foot increased to $393 as compared to $390 at June 30, 2002, while total retail sales per square foot increased to $388 at June 30, 2003 as compared to $384 at June 30, 2002. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $31.47 per square foot at June 30, 2003, an increase of $1.44 or 5%, from June 30, 2002. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during the first six months of 2003 was $42.90, an increase of $10.11 or 31% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired.
        Major factors driving results for the quarter:
 - 
The Company's core business continued to perform well despite the economic environment as evidenced by stable regional mall occupancy and average base rents 5% higher than the year earlier period.
 - 
The portfolio of assets acquired from Rodamco North America, N.V. on May 3, 2002 continues to contribute to profitability.
 - 
The favorable interest rate environment has provided opportunities to refinance existing debt at lower rates.
        "We are pleased to report a strong quarter of performance by our core portfolio," said David Simon, chief executive officer. "Tenant sales were up, occupancy held firm and we experienced strong releasing spreads. We are also somewhat encouraged by early signs that the U.S. economy is recovering and have seen recent evidence of this in our portfolio, especially in some of our Florida and other tourism-driven properties that were most significantly impacted by the economic downturn. Our acquisition and disposition activities have continued to strengthen our overall portfolio quality, and we look forward to a strong remainder of 2003."
New Development Projects
        The Company has two new development projects currently under construction:
 - 
Las Vegas Premium Outlets is a 435,000 square foot premium manufacturers' outlet shopping center. This will be the Company's second 50/50 joint venture with Chelsea Property Group. The center is under construction on a 39-acre parcel near downtown Las Vegas, located at Interstate 15 and US route 95/93 at Charleston Boulevard. The site is one of the most visible locations in Las Vegas, approximately 10 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip. The center will offer shoppers the area's largest collection of upscale outlet stores and is scheduled to open on August 1, 2003.
 - 
Chicago Premium Outlets is the third development to be undertaken jointly by Simon and Chelsea. Also a 50/50 joint venture, the site is approximately 35 miles west of downtown Chicago on Interstate 88, also known as the East-West Tollway, in Aurora, Illinois. This premium manufacturers' outlet shopping center will comprise 438,000 square feet. Scheduled opening: Summer 2004.
        The Company also announced today that it has acquired land in Jacksonville, Florida to construct St. Johns Town Center, a 1.5 million square foot open-air retail project. The project will be comprised of a village component with a mainstreet design and a community center. Costs are expected to approximate $158 million and the project is scheduled to open in 2005.
Acquisitions
        On July 1, the Company announced that it has agreed to purchase a 100 percent stake in Stanford Shopping Center, in Palo Alto, California, for $333 million. Stanford University, as required under its Founding Grant, will continue to hold, as lessor, a long-term ground lease underlying the asset. This transaction, which is subject to customary due diligence and closing conditions, is expected to close in mid August, 2003.
        Stanford Shopping Center, which has been managed by the University's Stanford Management Company, is one of the most successful regional malls in the United States with 2002 total sales in excess of $500 million and comparable tenant sales per square foot of approximately $600. Stanford Shopping Center is one of the few open-air super-regional shopping centers in the United States and is anchored by five major department storesNeiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Macy's Men's Store.
Dispositions
        The Company disposed of five assets during the second quarter and in early July, consisting of two malls: Forest Village Park Mall in Forestville, Maryland and Eastern Hills Mall in Buffalo, New York, and three community centers: North Riverside Park Plaza in North Riverside, Illinois; Memorial Plaza in Sheboygan, Wisconsin and Fox River Plaza in Elgin, Illinois. Proceeds from these dispositions totaled $59 million.
Dividends
        Today the Company also announced a common stock dividend of $0.60 per share. This dividend will be paid on September 30, 2003 to shareholders of record on September 16, 2003.
        The Company also declared dividends on its three public issues of preferred stock, all payable on September 30, 2003 to shareholders of record on September 16, 2003:
 - 
Simon Property Group, Inc. 6.50% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (NYSE:SPGPrB)$1.625 per share

Simon Property Group, Inc. 8.75% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (NYSE:SPGPrF)$0.546875 per share
 - 
Simon Property Group, Inc. 7.89% Series G Cumulative Preferred Stock (NYSE:SPGPrG)$0.98625 per share.
2003 Guidance
        The Company expects net income per share for the year to be within a range of $1.54 to $1.57 and FFO to be within a range of $4.05 to $4.08. The following table provides the reconciliation of estimated diluted net income per share and estimated diluted FFO per share.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003
        This guidance is based on management's view of current market conditions in the regional mall business. The guidance ranges do not include property transactions, other than transactions that have already closed and the announced acquisition of Stanford Shopping Center.
Forward-Looking Statements
        Estimates of future net income per share and FFO are by definition, and certain other matters discussed in this press release may be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.

obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The reader is directed to the Company's various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, reports on Form 8-K and annual reports on Form 10-K for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties.

SELECTED REGIONAL MALL OPERATING STATISTICS
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
        Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.

On December 31, 2002, Simon Property Group, Inc. merged with its paired share affiliate, SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. The Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets represent the combined, condensed financial statements of Simon Property Group, Inc. and SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. for 2002.
(B)
The results reflect the acquisition of assets from Rodamco North America N.V. on May 3, 2002. The portfolio acquired by Simon consists primarily of interests in 13 high-quality, highly productive regional malls in the United States.
(C)
On January 1, 2003, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., acquired all of the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. MSM is now a wholly owned consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of Simon Property Group, L.P. As of January 1, 2003, financial results of MSM are reported on the consolidated method. New line items on the Statements of Operations as a result of the consolidation are: Management fees and other revenue, Home and regional office costs, General and administrative expense, and Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries. In prior years, a portion of Home and regional office costs and General and administrative expense incurred by MSM was allocated to the consolidated properties and reported as Property operating expense. Effective with the consolidation of MSM, this allocation is eliminated in 2003 and the allocations in 2002 have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Home and regional office costs include salary and benefits, office rent, office expenses and information services expenses incurred in the Company's home office and regional offices. General and administrative expense represents the costs of operating as a public company and includes such items as stock exchange fees, public and investor relations expenses, executive officers' compensation expenses, audit fees, and legal fees.
(D)
Includes mall and freestanding stores.
(E)
Based on the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, which includes only mall and freestanding stores.
(F)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(G)
FFO for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2002 have been restated to reflect the Company's share of impairment of technology assets and gains on debt-related transactions previously reported as extraordinary under GAAP, reducing FFO by a net $20.4 million, or $0.08 per share for the quarter, and a net $24.6 million, or $0.10 per share for the six months.
(H)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $15.0 million and $8.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $20.8 million and $17.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(I)
Includes our share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $2.2 million and $3.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $3.9 million and $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(J)
Includes dividends of Series A, B and C Preferred Stock allocable to the Company as well as increased allocation of FFO to the Company as a result of assumed increase in the number of common shares outstanding. The Series A shares impacted only the 2002 results as they were converted during 2002.
(K)
Discontinued Joint Venture Interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold or consolidated. Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of June 30, 2003.
