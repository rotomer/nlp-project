Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.
        At September 30, 2003, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 239 properties which consisted of regional malls, community shopping centers and office and mixed-use properties (mixed-use properties include a combination of retail, office space or hotel components) containing an aggregate of 185 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 36 states. The Company also holds interests in nine assets in Europe and Canada and ownership interests in other real estate assets.
        On January 1, 2003, the Operating Partnership acquired the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. The interests acquired consist of 95% of the voting common stock of MSM and approximately 3% of the economic interests of MSM. MSM is now a wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of September 30, 2003, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.

Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income and earnings per share. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means consolidated net income without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from extraordinary items and gains or losses on the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion, based on economic ownership interest, of funds from operations of
unconsolidated joint ventures, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, FFO does not represent cash flow from operations, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Includes mall and freestanding stores
(3)
Includes all Owned GLA.
(4)
Represents only those tenants who report sales.
(5)
Based upon the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers which includes only mall and freestanding stores less than 10,000 square feet.
(7)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $2.9 million and $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively and $23.7 million and $28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(8)
FFO for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002 have been restated to reflect the Company's losses on debt-related transactions previously reported as extraordinary under GAAP and share of impairment of technology assets, reducing FFO by a net $1.8 million, or $0.01 per share for the quarter, and a net $26.4 million, or $0.10 per share for the nine months.

For purposes of computing FFO per share
(2)
Market value of Common Stock, Units and all issues of Preferred Stock of the Company.
        On the following three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data intended to report the Company's economic ownership of the entire Simon Group portfolio. While these combined statements were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, we believe they reflect the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation:
    The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property by property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
(1)
Additional Simon Brand Ventures and Simon Business Network revenues are recorded in minimum rent.
(2)
Income and costs associated with hedging transactions to manage the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the Euro currency as a result of the acquisition of Rodamco North America in 2002.
(1)
NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio. However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
Does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
Should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
Is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
Is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

Includes mall and freestanding stores.

Includes all Owned GLA.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaOctober 30, 2003 . . . Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) today announced diluted funds from operations ("FFO") per share for the third quarter of 2003 of $0.93, compared to $0.93 (as restated) for the third quarter of 2002. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.22 per share, compared to $0.32 for the third quarter of 2002. Third quarter 2003 results were impacted by the following events:
 - 
On October 8, 2003, SPG and Westfield America, Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Westfield America Trust (ASX: WFA), announced the withdrawal of their tender offer for all of the outstanding common shares of Taubman Centers, Inc. (NYSE: TCO). As a result of this withdrawal, all costs related to the tender offer were expensed during the third quarter. The costs totaled $10.5 million, or $0.04 per share, impacting FFO and net income.
 - 
On September 10, 2003, the Federal District Court for the District of Minnesota issued its Order in the litigation brought by Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc. against the Company and other named defendants. While the Court did not find that the Company breached fiduciary duties to Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc., its Order nonetheless gives Triple Five the right, within nine months after the date of the Order, to purchase the Company's 27.5% partnership interest that the Company acquired from Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Association in October of 1999. According to the Order, if Triple Five buys the Company's partnership interest, the Company must disgorge all "net profits" received with respect to that interest.
The Company believes that the Order contains numerous legal and factual errors and will appeal the Order to the Eighth Circuit. Even though the Company feels strongly about its arguments on appeal, it will take a reserve equal to $6 million as of September 30, 2003, which takes into account its estimate of the financial impact to the Company from the various elements of the Court's Order. This reserve impacts net income by approximately $0.02 per share. In addition, no further contribution to FFO will be recorded in subsequent periods by the Company with respect to its Mall of America partnership interest until such time as the issues in this litigation are resolved. For the third quarter of 2003, this impact reduced FFO by slightly less than $0.01 per share.
        Without giving effect to the events discussed above, diluted FFO for the third quarter of 2003 was $0.97 per share, compared with $0.93 for the third quarter of 2002, and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.29 per share, compared to $0.32 for the third quarter of 2002.
        For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, diluted FFO was $2.78 per share, compared to $2.51 (as restated) in 2002. Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $0.78, compared to $1.47 in 2002. The decline in net income for the nine months is attributable to net gains on the sale of real estate, primarily the sale of the Company's interests in five "Mills-type" properties and a premium outlet center in the second quarter of 2002, in addition to the events described above for the third quarter of 2003.
        Without giving effect to the TCO and Mall of America items previously discussed, diluted FFO for the first nine months of 2003 was $2.82 per share, compared with $2.51 for the same period in 2002, and diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2003 was $0.85, compared to $1.47 for the same period in 2002.
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at September 30, 2003 was 91.9%, equal to the occupancy level at September 30, 2002. Comparable retail sales per square foot increased to $398 as compared to $391 at September 30, 2002, while total retail sales per square foot increased to $394 at September 30, 2003 as compared to $385 at September 30, 2002. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $31.87 per square foot at September 30, 2003, an increase of $1.50 or 5%, from September 30, 2002. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during the first nine months of 2003 was $40.80, an increase of $8.12 or 25% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired.
        "Our results for the quarter, affected by the financial impact of expensing the TCO tender offer costs and the Mall of America Court Order, do not fully reflect the continued solid performance of our core business," said David Simon, chief executive officer. "Our core business fundamentals continue to demonstrate strength and stability. Regional mall occupancy remains steady, average base rents increased 5%, tenant sales increased roughly 2% after a successful back-to-school season, and releasing spreads for the first nine months were 25% higher than expiring rents. Our high-quality regional mall portfolio is performing to our expectations and in-line with our 2003 plan."
2003 Guidance
        The Company expects net income per share for the year to be within a range of $1.41 to $1.44 and FFO to be within a range of $4.00 to $4.03. This guidance range is slightly higher than the previous guidance range given, excluding the write-off of TCO tender offer costs and the Company's discontinuing the recording of contribution to FFO from the Company's interest in Mall of America. The following table provides the reconciliation of prior estimated diluted FFO per share to current estimated diluted FFO per share to estimated diluted net income per share.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003
        This guidance is based on management's view of current market conditions in the regional mall business. The guidance ranges do not include property transactions, other than transactions that have already closed.
New Development Projects
        Las Vegas Premium Outlets, a 50/50 joint venture project developed by Simon and Chelsea Property Group, opened on August 1, 2003. Las Vegas Premium Outlets is a 435,000 square-foot, single-phase upscale outlet center located between Grand Central Parkway and Interstate 15, near the intersection of U.S. Route 95, approximately 2/ miles from the north end of the Las Vegas Strip.

The center will also feature a Village Green for art shows, outdoor concerts and other activities, all designed to convey the look and feel of an urban main street. Simon owns the project in a 50/50 joint venture with Lauth Property Group. Gross costs are expected to approximate $108 million and the project is scheduled to open in the fall of 2004.
th
 - 
St. Johns Town Center, a 1.5 million square foot open-air retail project, is under construction in Jacksonville, Florida. The project will be comprised of a village component with a mainstreet design and a community center. Simon is developing the project in conjunction with joint venture partner Ben Carter Properties. Initially, the Company will own 85% of this project until certain financial hurdles are met. Gross costs are expected to approximate $158 million and the project is scheduled to open in March of 2005.
        The Company also announced today that it expects to commence construction early in 2004 on two additional projects:
 - 
Firewheel Center will be a 785,000 square foot open air regional shopping center located at the intersection of State Road 190 and President George Bush Expressway and State Road 78 in Garland, Texas. The project will feature Foley's, Dillard's, AMC, Barnes & Noble, Circuit City, Sports Authority and Linens N' Things. The project will contain approximately 245,000 square feet of small shop space, four sit-down restaurants, plus 75,000 square feet of second level office space. Gross costs are expected to approximate $126 million and the project is scheduled to open in the fall of 2005. SPG will own 100% of this asset.

Wolf Ranch will be anchored by Target and Kohl's and contain eight junior anchors including Linens N' Things, Office Depot and PetsMart. Gross costs are expected to approximate $80 million and the project is scheduled to open in August of 2005. SPG will also own 100% of this asset.

Acquisitions
        On August 20, 2003, the Company purchased a 100 percent stake in Stanford Shopping Center, in Palo Alto, California, for $333 million. Stanford Shopping Center is one of the most successful regional malls in the United States with 2002 total sales in excess of $500 million and comparable tenant sales per square foot of approximately $600.
        The Company also announced today that it expects to complete a series of transactions that will increase its ownership in Kravco Investments L.P. (KI), a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based owner of regional malls, and Kravco Company (KC), its affiliated property management company. These transactions, which could close in the next 30 days, will increase SPG's ownership in KI to approximately 80% and in KC to 50%. Members of the family of Arthur Powell, one of the founders of these companies, will retain ownership of the remaining interests.
        SPG is acquiring interests in KI and KC from certain private investors, The Rouse Company and Westfield America Trust. SPG, Rouse and Westfield obtained their interests in Kravco in connection with the 2002 acquisition of assets from Rodamco North America, N.V. SPG currently owns approximately 18% of KI and 15% of KC.
        KI owns interests in seven regional malls, six of which are located in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Included in the portfolio is an interest in the Plaza and Court at King of Prussia, one of the country's most successful regional malls. Sales per square foot of the KI mall portfolio for 2002 exceeded $400. KI also owns interests in three community shopping centers.
        KC manages a number of retail assets in addition to the KI portfolio and also operates a third-party development business. KC will continue to be headquartered in King of Prussia, PA.
        Total consideration to be paid by SPG in these transactions is approximately $300 million, including the assumption of its pro rata share of mortgage indebtedness. SPG expects to issue $120 million of perpetual preferred operating partnership units as part of the consideration. SPG expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to its funds from operations.
        The Kravco transactions are subject to execution of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions.

SELECTED REGIONAL MALL OPERATING STATISTICS
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
        Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(A)
On December 31, 2002, Simon Property Group, Inc. merged with its paired share affiliate, SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. The Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets represent the combined, condensed financial statements of Simon Property Group, Inc. and SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. for 2002.
(B)
The results reflect the acquisition of assets from Rodamco North America N.V. on May 3, 2002. The portfolio acquired by Simon consists primarily of interests in 13 high-quality, highly productive regional malls in the United States.
(C)
On January 1, 2003, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., acquired all of the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. MSM is now a wholly owned consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of Simon Property Group, L.P. As of January 1, 2003, financial results of MSM are reported on the consolidated method. New line items on the Statements of Operations as a result of the consolidation are: Management fees and other revenue, Home and regional office costs, General and administrative expense, and Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries. In prior years, a portion of Home and regional office costs and General and administrative expense incurred by MSM was allocated to the consolidated properties and reported as Property operating expense. Effective with the consolidation of MSM, this allocation is eliminated in 2003 and the allocations in 2002 have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Home and regional office costs include salary and benefits, office rent, office expenses and information services expenses incurred in the Company's home office and regional offices. General and administrative expense represents the costs of operating as a public company and includes such items as stock exchange fees, public and investor relations expenses, executive officers' compensation expenses, audit fees, and legal fees.
(D)
Includes mall and freestanding stores.
(E)
Based on the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, which includes only mall and freestanding stores.
(F)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(G)
FFO for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002 have been restated to reflect the Company's losses on debt-related transactions previously reported as extraordinary under GAAP and share of impairment of technology assets, reducing FFO by a net $1.8 million, or $0.01 per share for the quarter, and a net $26.4 million, or $0.10 per share for the nine months.
(H)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $2.9 million and $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $23.7 million and $28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(I)
Includes our share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $0.6 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $4.5 million and $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(J)
Includes dividends of Series A, B and C Preferred Stock allocable to the Company as well as increased allocation of FFO to the Company as a result of assumed increase in the number of common shares outstanding. The Series A shares impacted only the 2002 results as they were converted during 2002.
(K)
Discontinued Joint Venture Interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold or consolidated. Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of September 30, 2003.
