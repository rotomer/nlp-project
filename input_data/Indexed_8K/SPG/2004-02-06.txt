Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.
        At December 31, 2003, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 246 properties which consisted of regional malls, community shopping centers and office and mixed-use properties (mixed-use properties include a combination of retail, office space or hotel components) containing an aggregate of 190 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 37 states and Canada, as well as ownership interests in other real estate assets in North America. The Company holds interests in 47 assets in Europe (in France, Italy, Poland and Portugal).
        On January 1, 2003, the Operating Partnership acquired the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. The interests acquired consist of 95% of the voting common stock of MSM and approximately 3% of the economic interests of MSM. MSM is now a wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.
        In November 2003, the Company announced that it had completed a series of transactions which increased its ownership interest in Kravco Investments, L.P. (now renamed Kravco Simon Investments, L.P.), a Philadelphia-based owner of six regional malls and its affiliated property management company. These transactions increased the Company's ownership in Kravco Simon Investments, L.P. to approximately 80% and in the management company to approximately 50%. Members of the family of one of the original founders of the Kravco companies own the remaining interest. Total consideration for the purchases was approximately $293 million including the assumption of its pro rata share of mortgage indebtedness. The Operating Partnership issued approximately $107.4 million of perpetual preferred operating partnership units as part of the consideration.
        On December 30, 2003, the Company announced the closing of its joint venture with Rinascente Group. Gallerie Commerciali Italia S.p.A. ("GCI") was created for the ownership, management and development of shopping malls in Italy. The Rinascente Group contributed certain of its existing shopping center assets and development opportunities to GCI, and then sold 49% of the new company to an affiliate of the Company. The initial value of GCI is approximately Euro 860 million. The Company's equity investment was approximately Euro 187 million, which was funded through additional borrowings. The portfolio consists of 38 shopping centers currently open and operating, comprising approximately six million square feet (including hypermarket and certain small shop space not owned by GCI). GCI has several projects under construction and in predevelopment that could add up to six million additional square feet over the next five years.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of December 31, 2003, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements contained in this Supplemental Package may constitute "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties,

FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 has been restated for the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 to reflect the fair market value of leases from acquisitions, increasing FFO by $5.0 million or $0.02 per share. FFO for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, has been restated for: the recording of fair market value of leases from acquisitions (increasing FFO by $5.0 million); the Company's gains on debt-related transactions previously reported as extraordinary under GAAP (increasing FFO by a net $14.3 million) and the Company's share of impairment of technology assets (reducing FFO by a net $26.7 million). The impact of the restatements for the year on a per share diluted basis was a net decrease of $0.03.

For purposes of computing FFO per share

Market value of Common Stock, Units and all issues of Preferred Stock of the Company.
        On the following three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data intended to report the Company's economic ownership of the entire Simon Group portfolio. While these combined statements were not prepared in accordance with GAAP, we believe they reflect the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation:
    The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property by property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on investment properties, each calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        The Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income provides "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio" and reconciles the amounts to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Computation of Comparable Property NOI Growth provides the increase in the comparable regional mall and mixed-use NOI for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaFebruary 5, 2004...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2003:
 - 
Diluted funds from operations ("FFO") per share for the quarter increased 6%, to $1.26 from $1.19 (as restated).
 - 
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 60%, to $0.83 from $0.52.
 - 
Diluted FFO per share for the twelve months increased 7%, to $4.04 from $3.76 (as restated).
 - 
Diluted earnings per share for the twelve months decreased 17%, to $1.65 from $1.99.
        The decline in net income for the twelve months is primarily attributable to net gains on the sale of real estate and joint venture interests in real estate in 2002 in excess of 2003 net gains. FFO for 2002 was restated to comply with the SEC's Regulation G and its subsequent guidance.
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        Comparable retail sales per square foot increased 3%, to $402 as compared to $391 at December 31, 2002, while total retail sales per square foot increased 4%, to $401 at December 31, 2003 as compared to $386 at December 31, 2002. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $32.26 per square foot at December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.56 or 5%, from December 31, 2002. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during 2003 was $41.28, an increase of $8.29 or 25% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired. Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at December 31, 2003 was 92.4%, as compared to 92.7% at December 31, 2002.
        "We are pleased with our growth in FFO for 2003, achieved even with the write-off of costs related to an abandoned tender offer, the cessation of earnings recognition from the Company's interest in Mall of America, and the earnings dilution associated with the sale of non-core assets," said David Simon, Chief Executive Officer. "We are poised for a successful 2004. Our core business fundamentals remain solid with regional mall average base rent growth of 5%, tenant sales growth of approximately 4%, and comparable property NOI growth of 3.5% for the year. Occupancy was down slightly at year-end due to a few retailer bankruptcy-related closings during the last three months of the year. Our continued confidence in the Company was demonstrated by our strong 8.3% dividend increase announced today."
Dividends
        Today the Company also announced a common stock dividend of $0.65 per share, an increase of 8.3%. This dividend will be paid on February 27, 2004 to shareholders of record on February 17, 2004.
        The Company also declared dividends on its two public issues of preferred stock, payable on March 31, 2004 to shareholders of record on March 17, 2004:

 - 
Simon Property Group, Inc. 7.89% Series G Cumulative Preferred Stock (NYSE:SPGPrG)- $0.98625 per share.
Development Activities
        The Company has five new development projects currently under construction:
 - 
Chicago Premium Outlets is the third development to be undertaken jointly by Simon and Chelsea Property Group. A 50/50 joint venture, the site is approximately 35 miles west of downtown Chicago on Interstate 88, also known as the East-West Tollway, in Aurora, Illinois. This upscale manufacturers' outlet shopping center will comprise 438,000 square feet. Net costs are expected to approximate $92 million and the project is scheduled to open May 19, 2004.
 - 
Clay Terrace is a 570,000 square foot upscale lifestyle center located at the southwest corner of U.S. 31 and 146 Street, approximately fifteen miles north of downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. Clay Terrace is an open-air, mixed-use shopping center project, incorporating a mix of "big box" anchor stores, specialty retail stores, unique restaurants and Class A office space. Clay Terrace tenants will include: Dick's Sporting Goods, Wild Oats, Circuit City, Mitchell's Fish Market, and Designer Shoe Warehouse. The Company owns the project in a 50/50 joint venture with Lauth Property Group. Gross costs are expected to approximate $108 million and the project is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Acquisitions
        During the fourth quarter, the Company completed a series of transactions that increased its ownership in Kravco Investments L.P. (KI), a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based owner of regional malls, and Kravco Company (KC), its affiliated property management company. These transactions increased SPG's ownership in KI to approximately 80% and in KC to 50%. Members of the family of Arthur Powell, one of the founders of these companies, retained ownership of the remaining interests.
        SPG acquired interests in KI and KC from certain private investors, The Rouse Company and Westfield America Trust. SPG, Rouse and Westfield obtained their interests in Kravco in connection with the 2002 acquisition of assets from Rodamco North America, N.V.
        KI was renamed Kravco Simon Investments (KSI) and KC was renamed Kravco Simon Company (KSC) to reflect the new ownership. KSI owns interests in six regional malls, five of which are located in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Included in the portfolio is an interest in the Plaza and Court at King of Prussia, one of the country's most successful regional malls. Occupancy of the KI mall portfolio was 93.4% at year-end and 2003 sales per square foot were $424. KI also owns interests in four community shopping centers.
        Total consideration paid by the Company in these transactions was approximately $293 million, including the assumption of its pro rata share of mortgage indebtedness. The Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., issued $107.4 million of perpetual preferred operating partnership units as part of the consideration.
        On December 30, the Company announced the completion of its joint venture with The Rinascente Group. Gallerie Commerciali Italia S.p.A ("GCI") was created for the ownership, management and development of shopping centers in Italy.
th
        The Rinascente Group contributed its existing shopping center assets and development opportunities to GCI, and then sold 49% of the new company to an affiliate of the Company. The initial value of GCI is approximately 860 million. The Company's equity investment was approximately 187 million, funded by a three-year unsecured term loan at Euro Libor plus 60 basis points provided by JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citicorp and UBS AG. The Company has the ability to elect three members to GCI's board of directors, including the right to appoint its Chairman. Through their respective board representatives, the Company and Rinascente have joint decision making power over matters affecting the operation and management of GCI, including new development opportunities and the acquisition and disposition of assets.
        The portfolio consists of 38 shopping centers currently open and operating, comprising approximately six million square feet (including hypermarket space and certain small shop space not
owned by GCI). Additionally, GCI has several projects under construction and in predevelopment that could add up to six million additional square feet over the next five years. This transaction significantly increases the Company's presence in Europe and partners the Company with Rinascente and Auchan, two of Europe's leading retailers.

Financing Activities
        On December 16, the Company announced that the holders of all but 18,340 shares of its approximately 4.3 million shares of 6.5% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption on December 15, 2003, exercised their right to convert their preferred stock into common stock prior to the redemption. The Company issued approximately 11.1 million shares of common stock to the holders of the preferred stock who exercised their conversion rights after November 13, 2003. The 18,340 shares of preferred stock not converted were redeemed by the Company at a price of $106.34 per share, which includes dividends accrued to the redemption date. The Company privately issued preferred stock to cover the cost of the preferred stock redeemed.
th
        On January 20, 2004, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., completed the issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes. The issue included $300 million of 3.75% Notes due 2009 and $200 million of 4.90% Notes due in 2014.
        Concurrent with the note pricing, the Company swapped the $300 million five-year tranche to floating rate debt at an effective rate of six month Libor in arrears plus less than one basis point. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay or exchange existing indebtedness. The transaction was priced on January 13, 2004.

SELECTED U.S. REGIONAL MALL OPERATING STATISTICS
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
        Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(A)
On December 31, 2002, Simon Property Group, Inc. merged with its paired share affiliate, SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. The Statements of Operations and Balance Sheets represent the combined, condensed financial statements of Simon Property Group, Inc. and SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. for 2002.
(B)
The results reflect the acquisition of assets from Rodamco North America N.V. on May 3, 2002. The portfolio acquired by Simon consists primarily of interests in 13 high-quality, highly productive regional malls in the United States.
(C)
On January 1, 2003, the Company's partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., acquired all of the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. ("MSM"). MSM provides management, leasing and other services for certain of the Company's properties. MSM is now a wholly owned consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of Simon Property Group, L.P. As of January 1, 2003, financial results of MSM are reported on the consolidated method. New line items on the Statements of Operations as a result of the consolidation are: Management fees and other revenue, Home and regional office costs, General and administrative expense, and Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries. In prior years, a portion of Home and regional office costs and General and administrative expense incurred by MSM was allocated to the consolidated properties and reported as Property operating expense. Effective with the consolidation of MSM, this allocation is eliminated in 2003 and the allocations in 2002 have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Home and regional office costs include salary and benefits, office rent, office expenses and information services expenses incurred in the Company's home office and regional offices. General and administrative expense represents the costs of operating as a public company and includes such items as stock exchange fees, public and investor relations expenses, executive officers' compensation expenses, audit fees, and legal fees.
(D)
Includes mall and freestanding stores.
(E)
Based on the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, which includes only mall and freestanding stores.
(F)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(G)
FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 has been restated for the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 to reflect the fair market value of leases from acquisitions, increasing FFO by $5.0 million or $0.02 per share. FFO for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, has been
restated for: the recording of fair market value of leases from acquisitions (increasing FFO by $5.0 million); the Company's gains on debt-related transactions previously reported as extraordinary under GAAP (increasing FFO by a net $14.3 million) and the Company's share of impairment of technology assets (reducing FFO by a net $26.7 million). The impact of the restatements for the year on a per share diluted basis was a net decrease of $0.03.
(H)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $18.3 million and $11.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $42.0 million and $39.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(J)
Includes dividends of Series A, B and C Preferred Stock allocable to the Company as well as increased allocation of FFO to the Company as a result of assumed increase in the number of common shares outstanding. The Series A shares impacted only the 2002 results as they were converted during 2002.
(K)
Discontinued Joint Venture Interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold or consolidated. Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of December 31, 2003.
