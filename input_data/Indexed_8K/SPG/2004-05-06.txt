Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.

The Company also holds interests in 48 assets in Europe (in France, Italy, Poland and Portugal).

        On the next two pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro rata basis reflecting the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation:
    The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        The Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income provides "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio" and reconciles the amounts to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Computation of Comparable Property NOI Growth provides the increase in the comparable regional mall and mixed-use NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaMay 6, 2004...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004:
 - 
Diluted funds from operations ("FFO") of the Simon portfolio for the quarter increased 9.2% to $254.3 million from $232.8 million in 2003. On a per share basis the increase was 7.9% to $0.96 per share from $0.89 per share in the first quarter of 2003.
 - 
Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter decreased 12.2% to $48.4 million from $55.1 million in 2003. On a per share basis the decrease was 17.2% to $0.24 per share from $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2003.
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        Comparable retail sales per square foot increased 5.4%, to $411 at March 31, 2004 as compared to $390 at March 31, 2003, while total retail sales per square foot increased 5.7%, to $408 at March 31, 2004 as compared to $386 at March 31, 2003. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $32.75 per square foot at March 31, 2004, an increase of $1.47 or 4.7%, from March 31, 2003. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during the first quarter of 2004 was $38.61, an increase of $6.25 or 19% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired. Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at March 31, 2004 was 91.1%, as compared to 91.7% at March 31, 2003.
        "The Company had a strong first quarter," said David Simon, Chief Executive Officer. "We experienced healthy increases in retail sales and continued to re-lease space at industry-leading spreads. While our occupancy rate was down as a result of tenant bankruptcy closures in the last six months, retailer demand for new space remains very solid and will support our retenanting efforts. We have completed nearly $500 million of high-quality asset acquisitions since year-end at attractive yields. These acquisitions, coupled with the strength of our core portfolio and robust development pipeline, position us well for the remainder of 2004."

Development Activities
        Yesterday, the Company's Board of Directors approved the development of Coconut Point, a 166 acre town center located in a master-planned 500-acre mixed-use development located in Estero/Bonita Springs on the west coast of Florida, halfway between Ft. Myers and Naples. Coconut Point will be an open-air, mixed-use mainstreet regional shopping center with a community center component featuring 18 acres of lakes, a pedestrian boardwalk and unique architecture. Coconut Point will include 1.2 million square feet of retail space, 90,000 square feet of office condominiums and 200 to 400 residential units.
        Coconut Point's retail space, designed by world-renowned architects, The Jerde Partnership of Venice, CA, will be comprised of three components. The village will be a mainstreet design anchored by Dillard's, Muvico Theatres, Barnes & Noble and four restaurants. The Village is expected to include small shop tenants such as Apple, Hollister, J. Jill, Jos. A. Banks, Talbots and Williams-Sonoma. The community center will be anchored by Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Designer Shoe Warehouse, Office Max, Old Navy, PetsMart, Pier One, Ross Dress for Less and Sports Authority. Connecting the village and the community center will be the third component, a unique and exciting concept called The Lakefront. This environment will contain entertainment, casual and sit-down dining and shops.
        Residential condominiums will be developed over the mainstreet above two of the retail buildings, with the balance of the units, a clubhouse and a pool on a 3.7 acre parcel behind the main street. The development and sale of the residential condominiums will be undertaken by a third party developer who specializes in residential products.
        Phase I, which includes the community center, The Lakefront shops and a portion of the village inclusive of the Muvico Theater, is expected to open in October of 2005. Phase II, which includes the balance of the main street from Barnes & Noble to Dillard's, along with the commercial and residential condominiums, is projected to open in September of 2006. The Company owns the project in a 50/50 joint venture with Dillard's, Inc. Gross costs are expected to approximate $224 million and construction is expected to commence in June of 2004.

Mall of America Update
        The September 10, 2003 Order of the Federal District Court in Minnesota requires the Company to disgorge "net profits" received as a result of its ownership interest in Mall of America from October, 1999 to the present. The Court-appointed Special Master issued his findings regarding his computation of net profits in a memorandum issued May 3, 2004. As a result of this memorandum, the Company recorded an additional estimated loss on the disposition of this asset in the first quarter of $13.5 million, or $0.05 per share. This item adversely impacted net income, but did not affect Funds from Operations. We have appealed the Court's Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We will also be appealing the Special Master's findings. The Company has not recorded earnings from Mall of America since the date of the Order.
2004 Guidance
        The Company updated its 2004 earnings guidance today. Diluted net income per share is expected to be within a range of $1.61 to $1.65 and diluted FFO per share is expected to be within a range of $4.28 to $4.32.
        The following table provides the reconciliation of estimated diluted net income per share to diluted FFO per share.

SELECTED U.S. REGIONAL MALL OPERATING STATISTICS
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
        Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We generally amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(A)
Represents additional estimated loss recorded as a result of the Special Master's memorandum on May 3, 2004 clarifying the calculation of "net profits" that must be disgorged by the Company related to the Mall of America litigation. The Company has appealed the Court's September 10, 2003 Order and will appeal the Special Master's findings.
(B)
Includes mall and freestanding stores.
(C)
Based on the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, which includes only mall and freestanding stores.
(D)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(E)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $4.3 million and $5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(F)

The Series B shares impacted only the 2003 results as they were converted or redeemed during 2003.
(I)
Discontinued Joint Venture Interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold or consolidated. Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of March 31, 2004.
