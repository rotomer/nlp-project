Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon Property") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.
        At June 30, 2004, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 247 properties which consisted of regional malls, community shopping centers and office and mixed-use properties (mixed-use properties include a combination of retail, office space or hotel components) containing an aggregate of 192 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 37 states plus Puerto Rico and Canada. The Company also holds interests in 48 shopping centers in Europe (in France, Italy, Poland and Portugal).
        On June 21, 2004 the Company announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Chelsea Property Group, Inc. ("Chelsea") (NYSE: CPG) and its operating partnership subsidiary in a transaction valued at approximately $3.5 billion. The Company will also assume Chelsea's existing indebtedness and preferred stock, which totaled approximately $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2004. Chelsea has interests in 60 premium outlet and other shopping centers containing 16.7 million square feet of gross leasable area in 31 states and Japan. The transaction is subject to approval by Chelsea's shareholders, as well as customary closing conditions, and is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2004.

        On the next two pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro rata basis reflecting the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation:
    The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        However, you should understand that NOI:
        does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
        should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
        is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
        is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        The Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income provides "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio" and reconciles the amounts to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Computation of Comparable Property NOI Growth provides the increase in the comparable regional mall and mixed-use NOI for the six months ended June 30, 2004.

SELECTED U.S. REGIONAL MALL OPERATING STATISTICS
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
        Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We generally amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(A)
On April 7, 2004, the Company sold its interest in the New York Times Square Westin Hotel. SPG's share of gross proceeds was $17 million, resulting in a net gain of $11.6 million. The tax effect of this gain of $4.4 million is included in Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries on the Statements of Operations.
(B)
Represents additional estimated loss recorded as a result of the Special Master's memorandum on May 3, 2004 clarifying the calculation of "net profits" that must be disgorged by the Company related to the Mall of America litigation. The Company has appealed the Court's September 10, 2003 Order and will appeal the Special Master's findings.
(C)
Includes mall and freestanding stores.
(D)
Based on the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, which includes only mall and freestanding stores.
(E)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(F)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $10.3 million and $15.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $14.6 million and $20.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(G)
Includes our share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $0.8 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $3.0 million and $3.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(H)

(I)
Includes dividends of Series B and C Preferred Stock allocable to the Company as well as increased allocation of FFO to the Company as a result of assumed increase in the number of common shares outstanding. The Series B shares impacted only the 2003 results as they were converted or redeemed during 2003.
(J)
Discontinued Joint Venture Interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold or consolidated. Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of June 30, 2004.
