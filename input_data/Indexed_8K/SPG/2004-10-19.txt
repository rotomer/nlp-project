Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
 
by and among Simon, Simon Property Group, L.P. ("SPG LP"), Simon Acquisition I, LLC ("Merger Sub"), Simon Acquisition II, LLC ("L.P. Merger Sub"), Chelsea and CPG Partners, L.P. ("CPG LP")Si
On October 14, 2004 (the "Closing Date"), Simon Property Group, Inc. ("Simon") acquired Chelsea Property Group, Inc. ("Chelsea") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"),
.  On the Closing Date,
mon acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Chelsea and all of the operating partnership units of Chelsea's operating partnership, CPG LP, in a transaction (the "Transaction") valued at approximately $3.5 billion.  Simon also assumed Chelsea's existing indebtedness and preferred stock, which totaled approximately $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2004.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of SPG LP, was merged with and into Chelsea on the Closing Date with Chelsea as the surviving entity (the "REIT Merger").
 
Simon paid consideration of $67.61 per share for all of Chelsea's outstanding common stock.  The consideration to Chelsea's common shareholders was comprised of $36.00 in cash, $16.61 of Simon common stock based on a fixed conversion ratio of 0.2936 of a share of Simon common stock per Chelsea common share and a Closing Date closing price for Simon common stock of $56.58 per share, and $15.00 of Simon 6% Series I Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series I Preferred Stock").  The shares of Series I Preferred Stock yield 6.0%, have a liquidation preference of $50 per share, and are convertible into Simon common stock at $63.86 per share, with a contingent conversion feature of an additional 25%.  This was a taxable transaction to Chelsea common shareholders.  Upon the consummation of the Transaction, Chelsea became a subsidiary of the Simon operating partnership, SPG LP.
 
In connection with the Transaction, each outstanding common unit of CPG LP ("CPG LP Common Units") (other than units owned by Simon, Chelsea or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) was voluntarily exchanged for the right to receive (i) 0.6459 of a partnership unit in SPG LP (the "SPG LP Common Units") and (ii) 0.6600 of a 6% Series I Convertible Perpetual Preferred Unit of SPG LP (the "Series I Preferred Units").  The Series I Preferred Units have substantially the same economic terms as the Simon Series I Preferred Stock, except that they are, at the option of the holder, (i) convertible into SPG LP Common Units on substantially the same terms and at the same conversion rate as the Simon Series I Preferred Stock is convertible into Simon common stock and (ii) exchangeable for either cash equal to the fair market value of such units or shares of Simon Series I Preferred Stock on a one-for-one basis, at Simon's election.
 
In connection with the Transaction, each share of Chelsea's 8 /8% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the REIT Merger (other than shares owned by Simon, Chelsea or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) was converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of Simon 8 /8% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock .

On or after October 14, 2009, the Corporation shall have the option to redeem, subject to Section 6(j) hereof, for cash only (i) some or all the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the Redemption Price, but only if the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock for 20 Trading Days within a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day prior to the date the Corporation gives notice of such redemption pursuant to this Section 6 exceeds 130% of the Conversion Price in effect on each such Trading Day and (ii) all the Outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the Redemption Price, but only if, on any Dividend Payment Date, the total number of Outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock is less than 15% of the total number of Outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock on October 14, 2004.
 
(b)  In the event the Corporation elects to redeem shares of Series I Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall:
 
(i)  send a written notice to the Registrar and Transfer Agent of the Redemption Date, stating the number of shares to be redeemed and the Redemption Price, at least 35 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Registrar and Transfer Agent);
 
(ii)  send a written notice by first class mail to each holder of record of the Series I Preferred Stock at such holder's registered address, not fewer than 20 nor more than 90 days prior to the Redemption Date, stating:
 
(A)  the Redemption Date;
 
(B)  the Redemption Price;
 
(C)  the Conversion Price and the Conversion Rate;
 
(D)  the name and address of the Paying Agent and Conversion Agent;
 
(E)  that shares of Series I Preferred Stock called for redemption may be converted at any time before 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date;
 
(F)  that holders who want to convert shares of the Series I Preferred Stock must satisfy the requirements set forth in Section 7 of this Certificate;
 
(G)  that shares of the Series I Preferred Stock called for redemption must be surrendered
to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price;
 
(H)  if fewer than all the Outstanding shares of the Series I Preferred Stock are to be redeemed by the Corporation, the number of shares to be redeemed;
 
(I)  that, unless the Corporation defaults in making payment of such Redemption Price, dividends in respect of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock called for redemption will cease to accumulate on and after the Redemption Date;
 
(J)  the CUSIP number of the Series I Preferred Stock; and
 
(K)  any other information the Corporation wishes to present; and
 
(iii)  (A) issue a press release containing such information and (B) publish such information on the Corporation's web site on the World Wide Web.
 
(c)  If the Corporation gives notice of redemption, then, by 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Redemption Date, to the extent sufficient funds are legally available, the Corporation shall, with respect to:
 
(i)  shares of the Series I Preferred Stock held by DTC or its nominees, deposit or cause to be deposited, irrevocably with DTC, cash sufficient to pay the Redemption Price and shall give DTC irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to holders of such shares of the Series I Preferred Stock; and
 
(ii)  shares of the Series I Preferred Stock held in certificated form, deposit or cause to be deposited, irrevocably with the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the Redemption Price and shall give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to holders of such shares of the Series I Preferred Stock upon surrender of their certificates evidencing their shares of the Series I Preferred Stock.
 
(d)  If on the Redemption Date, DTC and/or the Paying Agent holds or hold money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price for the shares of Series I Preferred Stock delivered for redemption as set forth herein, dividends shall cease to accumulate as of the Redemption Date on those shares of the Series I Preferred Stock called for redemption and all rights of holders of such shares shall terminate, except for the right to receive the Redemption Price pursuant to this Section 6.
 
(e)  Payment of the Redemption Price for shares of the Series I Preferred Stock is conditioned upon book-entry transfer or physical delivery of certificates representing the Series I Preferred Stock, together with necessary endorsements, to the Paying Agent at any time after delivery of the notice of redemption.
 
(f)  Payment of the Redemption Price for shares of the Series I Preferred Stock will be made (1) on the Redemption Date, if book-entry transfer or physical delivery of the Series I Preferred Stock has been made by or on the Redemption Date, or (2) if book-entry transfer or physical delivery of the Series I Preferred Stock has not been made by or on the Redemption Date, at the time of such transfer or delivery.  If any shares of Series I Preferred Stock selected for partial redemption are submitted for conversion in part after such selection, such shares submitted for conversion shall be deemed (so far as may be possible) to be a portion of the shares selected for redemption.
 
(g)  If the Redemption Date falls after a Record Date and before the related Dividend Payment Date, holders of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the close of business on that Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on those shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date.
 
(h)  If fewer than all the Outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board of Directors and the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by lot, on a pro rata basis (with any fractional shares being rounded to the
nearest whole share), or by any other method as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be fair and appropriate.
 
(i)  Upon surrender of a certificate or certificates representing shares of the Series I Preferred Stock that is or are redeemed in part, the Corporation shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the holder, a new certificate or certificates representing shares of the Series I Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock surrendered for partial redemption.
 
(j)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, unless full cumulative dividends (whether or not declared) on all Outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock and Parity Stock have been paid or set apart for payment for all Dividend Periods terminating on or before the Redemption Date, none of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall be redeemed, and no sum shall be set aside for such redemption, unless pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of Series I Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock.
 
Section 7. 
Conversion.
 
(a)  Each share of Series I Preferred Stock shall be convertible, only on or after the occurrence of the conversion triggering events described in Section 7(b), into a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect at such time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any shares of Series I Preferred Stock are to be redeemed pursuant to Section 6, such conversion right shall cease and terminate, as to the shares of the Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, two Business Days immediately preceding the Redemption Date, unless the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price therefor, as provided herein.
Right to Convert. 
 
(b)  A holder may surrender shares of Series I Preferred Stock for conversion into shares of Common Stock:
 
(i)  if called for redemption pursuant to Section 6 hereof;
 
(ii)  if the Corporation is a party to a Change of Control, in which case each share of Series I Preferred Stock may be surrendered for conversion at any time from and after the date that is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Change of Control until 15 days after the actual date of such Change of Control and, at such effective date, the right to convert the Series I Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock shall be changed into a right to convert such Series I Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property of the Corporation or another Person that the holder would have received if the holder had converted such Series I Preferred Stock immediately prior to the transaction; or
 
(iii)  during any fiscal quarter after the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004 (and only during such fiscal quarter) if the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is more than 125% of the Conversion Price on such Trading Day.  If this Closing Sale Price condition is not satisfied at the end of any fiscal quarter, then conversion pursuant to this Section 7(b)(iii) will not be permitted in the following fiscal quarter.  The Company shall determine for each Trading Day during the 30 consecutive Trading Day period specified in this Section 7(b)(iii) whether the Closing Sale Price exceeds 125% of the Conversion Price and whether the Series I Preferred Stock shall be convertible as a result of the occurrence of the event set forth in this Section 7(b)(iii).  Upon determination that holders of Series I Preferred Stock are or will be entitled to convert their Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(b)(iii), the Company will mail a written notice to the holders thereof and issue a press release within five Business Days thereafter and publish such information on its website on the World Wide Web.
(c)  Conversion of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock may be effected by any holder thereof upon the surrender to the Corporation, at the principal office of the Corporation or at the office of the Conversion Agent as may be designated by the Board of Directors, of the certificate or certificates for such shares of the Series I Preferred Stock to be converted accompanied by a complete and manually signed Notice of Conversion (as set forth in the form of Series I Preferred Stock certificate attached hereto) along with (A) appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as required by the Registrar or Conversion Agent and (B) if required pursuant to Section 7(d), funds equal to the dividend payable on the next Dividend Payment Date.  In case such Notice of Conversion shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock in such name or names (or proof that no such taxes are payable).  Other than such taxes, the Corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock pursuant hereto.  The conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been made as of the close of business on the date (the "") such certificate or certificates have been surrendered and such Notice of Conversion received and all required transfer taxes, if any, paid (or the demonstration to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such taxes have been paid).  Promptly (but no later than five Business Days) following the Conversion Date, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered (1) certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of Common Stock to which the holder of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock being converted (or such holder's transferee) shall be entitled, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and (2) if less than the full number of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by such surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares being converted.  As of the close of business on the Conversion Date, the rights of the holder of the Series I Preferred Stock as to the shares being converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares of Common Stock and the Person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at such time.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the case of Global Preferred Shares, Notices of Conversion may be delivered to, and shares of the Series I Preferred Stock representing beneficial interests in respect of such Global Preferred Shares may be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the applicable procedures of, the Depositary as in effect from time to time.
Conversion Procedures. 
Conversion Date
 
(d)  If a holder of shares of Series I Preferred Stock exercises conversion rights, such shares will cease to accumulate dividends as of the end of the day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.  On conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock, except for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Record Date corresponding to a Dividend Payment Date to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date, in which case the holder on such Dividend Record Date shall receive the dividends payable on such Dividend Payment Date, accumulated and unpaid dividends on the converted shares of Series I Preferred Stock shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the holder thereof through delivery of the Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Series I Preferred Stock being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.  Shares of the Series I Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion after the close of business on any Record Date for the payment of dividends declared and before the opening of business on the Dividend Payment Date corresponding to that Record Date must be accompanied by a payment to the Corporation in cash of an amount equal to the dividend payable in respect of those shares on such Dividend Payment Date; that a holder of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock on a Record Date who converts such shares into shares of Common Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the
Dividend and Other Payments Upon Conversion. 
provided
dividend payable on such shares of the Series I Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date, and such holder need not include payment to the Corporation of the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock for conversion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of the Series I Preferred Stock are converted during the period between the close of business on any Record Date and the opening of business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date and the Corporation has called such shares of the Series I Preferred Stock for redemption during such period, or the Corporation has designated a Change of Control Purchase Date during such period, then, in each case, the holder who tenders such shares for conversion shall receive the dividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date and need not include payment of the amount of such dividend upon surrender of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock for conversion.
 
(e)  In connection with the conversion of any shares of the Series I Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of any fractional interest in an amount equal to the fractional interest multiplied by the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Conversion Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent.
Fractional Shares. 
 
(f)  If more than one share of the Series I Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion by the same holder at the same time, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of those shares shall be computed on the basis of the total number of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock so surrendered.
Total Shares. 
 
(g) 
Reservation of Shares; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock; Shares to
be Fully Paid. 
The Corporation shall:
 
(i)  at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, for issuance upon the conversion of shares of the Series I Preferred Stock such number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all Outstanding shares of the Series I Preferred Stock;
 
(ii)  prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock, comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations that require action to be taken by the Corporation in connection with such delivery;
 
(iii)  use its commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that all shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock will, upon delivery, be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other national exchange, if any, on which the Common Stock is then listed); and
 
(iv)  ensure that all shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock will, upon delivery, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any preemptive rights.
 
Section 8.  The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the
Conversion Rate Adjustments. 
Corporation in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.
 
(a)  If the Corporation shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date following the Record Date shall be increased by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction,
 
(i)  the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution; and
(ii)  the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date.
 
Such increase shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following such Record Date.  If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 8(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b)  If the Corporation shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of any class of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) days after the Record Date) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the Current Market Price on the Record Date, other than issuances that are subject to certain triggering events (until such time as such triggering events occur), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such Record Date by a fraction,
 
(i)  the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible); and
 
(ii)  the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at such Current Market Price.
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following such Record Date.  In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof; the Fair Market Value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive.
 
(c)  If the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, in the event outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced; such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
 
(d)  If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Corporation (other than any dividends or distributions to which Section 8(a) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding (i) any rights or warrants referred to in Section 8(b) or (ii) any dividend or distribution (x) paid exclusively in cash or (y) referred to in Section 8(a)) (any of the foregoing hereinafter referred to in this Section 8(d) as the ""), then, in each such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by
Distributed Property
multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction,
 
(i)  the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date; and
 
(ii)  the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date less the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on such Record Date of the portion of the Distributed Property applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such Record Date).
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; that if the then Fair Market Value (as so determined by the Board of Directors) of the portion of the Distributed Property applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of Series I Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder converted each share of its Series I Preferred Stock on the Record Date.  To the extent that any of the Distributed Property is not distributed, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made been made on the basis of only the Distributed Property actually distributed.  If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 8(d) by reference to the trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price on the applicable Record Date.
provided
 
Rights or warrants distributed by the Corporation to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Corporation's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""):  (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 8(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8(d) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 8(d).  If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Certificate, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof).  In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8(d) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such
Trigger Event
rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such expired or terminated rights and warrants had not been issued.
 
For purposes of Section 8(a), Section 8(b) and this Section 8(d), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 8(d) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants, as to which any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 8(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made, immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants, as to which any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Sections 8(a) and 8(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made, except any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on such Record Date" within the meaning of Sections 8(a) and 8(b).
 
(e)  If the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash, excluding (i) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, and (ii) any quarterly cash dividend on its Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate amount of cash distributions per share of Common Stock in any quarter does not exceed $0.65 (the ""), then, in such case, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date by a fraction,
Dividend Threshold Amount
 
(i)  the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date less the Dividend Threshold Amount (as such Dividend Threshold Amount may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 8(e)); and
 
(ii)  the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price on such Record Date less the amount of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock.
 
Such adjustment shall be effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Record Date; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of Series I Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder converted each share of Series I Preferred Stock on the Record Date.  To the extent that such dividend or distribution is not made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made been made on the basis of only the dividend or distribution actually made.  If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.  The Dividend Threshold Amount shall be adjusted inversely proportional to the adjustments to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to Sections 8(a), (b), (c) and (d) hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Rate after giving effect to any adjustments under this Section 8(e) shall not exceed 0.9787 (as such number may be adjusted on a proportional basis of the Conversion Rate, other than any adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(e)).
provided
 
(f)  The Corporation may make such increases in the Conversion Rate in addition to those required by this Section 8 as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least
20 days and the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that such increase would be in the best interest of the Corporation.  Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of the Series I Preferred Stock at the address of such holder as it appears in the stock register a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
 
(g)  No adjustment in the Conversion Rate (other than any adjustment pursuant to Section 8(e) above) shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Rate then in effect; that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 8(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by the Corporation and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be.  No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Corporation plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest or, except as set forth in this Section 8, for any issuance of Common Stock or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into Common Stock.  To the extent the Series I Preferred Stock becomes convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than Capital Stock of the Corporation), subject to Section 9, no adjustment need be made thereafter to the Conversion Rate.  Interest will not accrue on any cash into which the Series I Preferred Stock may be convertible.
provided, however,
 
(h)  Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation shall promptly file with the Conversion Agent an Officer's certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  Unless and until a responsible officer of the Conversion Agent shall have received such Officer's certificate, the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect.  Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Corporation shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each holder of Series I Preferred Stock at its last address appearing in the stock register within twenty (20) days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
 
(i)  For purposes of this Section 8, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation (but the issuance of shares held in treasury shall be deemed to be an issuance for purposes of this Section 8), unless such treasury shares participate in any distribution or dividend that requires an adjustment pursuant to this Section 8, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
 
Section 9. 
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale on Conversion Privilege.
 
(a)  If any of (i) any reclassification (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, and other than a subdivision or combination to which Section 8(c) applies) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Corporation with another Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation to any other Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then each share of Series I Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Series I Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance (provided that, if the kind or amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (""), then for the purposes of this Section 9 the kind and
non-electing share
amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares).
 
(b)  The Corporation shall cause notice of the application of this Section 9 to be delivered to each holder of the Series I Preferred Stock at the address of such holder as it appears in the stock register within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 9(a) and shall issue a press release containing such information and publish such information on its web site on the World Wide Web.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any conversion right pursuant to this Section 9.
 
(c)  The above provisions of this Section 9 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances, and the provisions of Section 8 shall apply to any shares of Capital Stock received by the holders of Common Stock in any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance; that if this Section 9 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 8 shall not apply to such event or occurrence.

Section 10.  Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series I Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of common stock or preferred stock purchase rights, as the case may be, if any, that shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any shareholder rights agreement adopted by the Corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time.
