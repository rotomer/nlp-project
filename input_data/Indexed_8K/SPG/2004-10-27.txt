Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon Property") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls and community shopping centers.
        At September 30, 2004, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 244 properties which consisted of regional malls, community shopping centers and office and mixed-use properties (mixed-use properties include a combination of retail, office space or hotel components) containing an aggregate of 188 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 37 states plus Puerto Rico and Canada. The Company also holds interests in 48 European shopping centers in France, Italy, Poland and Portugal.
        Subsequent to quarter-end, on October 14, 2004, the Company completed its $5.1 billion (including the assumption of debt) acquisition of Chelsea Property Group, Inc. ("Chelsea"). Chelsea common shareholders received merger consideration of $36.00 in cash; 0.2936 of a share of Simon common stock; and 0.3000 of a share of Simon 6% Series I convertible perpetual preferred stock for each share of Chelsea common stock. At closing, shares and units were issued as follows:

12,978,795 shares of Simon Property Common Stock
 - 
4,652,232 Simon Property Group, L.P. common units
 -

        Chelsea will operate as a division of SPG out of its current headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey, with David Bloom and the Chelsea management team continuing their leadership. David Bloom has been appointed as an Advisory Director of the Simon Property Group Board of Directors.
        Chelsea Property Group is the leading owner, developer and manager of Premium Outlet centers in the U.S. and Asia. Its portfolio includes 36 Premium Outlet centers (32 in the U.S. and 4 in Japan) located in major metropolitan markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and tourist destinations such as Orlando, Las Vegas and Palm Springs. The 32 domestic Premium Outlet centers are 98% occupied and generate sales per square foot of approximately $400. Chelsea's four Premium Outlet centers in Japan, located near Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka, are fully leased and generate average sales of more than $800 per square foot.

        On the next three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro rata basis reflecting the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation:
    The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        However, you should understand that NOI:
        does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
        should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
        is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
        is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        The Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income provides "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio" and reconciles the amounts to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Computation of Comparable Property NOI Growth provides the increase in the comparable regional mall and mixed-use NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaOctober 27, 2004...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004:
 - 
Diluted funds from operations ("FFO") of the Simon portfolio for the quarter increased 12.6% to $277.7 million from $246.7 million in 2003. On a per share basis the increase was 11.8% to $1.04 per share from $0.93 per share in the third quarter of 2003. Diluted FFO of the Simon portfolio for the nine months increased 9.1% to $800.5 million from $733.9 million in 2003. On a per share basis the increase was 8.3% to $3.01 per share from $2.78 per share in 2003.
 - 
Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter increased 73.5% to $74.1 million from $42.7 million in 2003. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 63.6% to $0.36 per share from $0.22 per share in the third quarter of 2003. Net income available to common shareholders for the nine months increased 30.4% to $193.2 million from $148.2 million in 2003. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 20.5% to $0.94 per share from $0.78 per share in 2003.
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        Comparable retail sales per square foot (sales for those tenants in-place for at least 24 months) increased 5.8%, to $421 at September 30, 2004 as compared to $398 at September 30, 2003, while total retail sales per square foot also increased 5.8%, to $417 at September 30, 2004 as compared to $394 at September 30, 2003. Average base rents for mall and freestanding stores in the regional mall portfolio were $33.07 per square foot at September 30, 2004, an increase of $1.20 or 3.8%, from September 30, 2003. The average initial base rent for new mall store leases signed during the first nine months of 2004 was $39.28, an increase of $6.38 or 19.4% over the tenants who closed or whose leases expired. Occupancy for mall and freestanding stores in the regional malls at September 30, 2004 was 91.8%, as compared to 91.9% at September 30, 2003.
        "We are pleased to report this quarter's growth in FFO and EPS," said David Simon, Chief Executive Officer. "Strong leasing activity resulted in a 50 basis point occupancy gain in our regional mall portfolio from June 30th, and tenant sales continued to be strong. These results were achieved despite a $2.3 million negative impact to our Florida properties as a result of physical damage from the four hurricanes. With the addition of Chelsea Property Group to our organization and our strong development pipeline in the U.S. and Europe, we are well-positioned to continue to grow our business."

U.S. REGIONAL MALL PORTFOLIO OPERATING STATISTICS
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
Notes:
(A)
Includes a $13.5 million loss recorded as a result of the Special Master's memorandum clarifying the calculation of "net profits" that were disgorged by the Company related to the Mall of America litigation. The Company has appealed the Court's September 10, 2003 Order and will appeal the Special Master's findings. Also includes the Company's $12.6 million gain on the sale of its interest in the New York Times Square Westin Hotel.
(B)
Includes the tax effect of the gain on the sale of the Company's interest in the New York Times Square Westin Hotel of $4.8 million.
(C)
Includes mall and freestanding stores.
(D)
Based on the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, which includes only mall and freestanding stores.
(E)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(F)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $9.8 million and $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $24.4 million and $23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(G)
Includes our share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $2.1 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $5.1 million and $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(H)
Includes our share of the fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $8.4 million and $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $25.5 million and $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(I)
During the third quarter of 2004, the Company's 25 malls in Florida were closed for a combined total of 142 days as a result of hurricanes and associated evacuations. The Company recorded a charge of $2.3 million, representing its share of the cost of physical damage from the hurricanes, net of expected recoveries from insurance carriers and tenants.
(J)
Includes dividends of Series B and C Preferred Stock allocable to the Company as well as increased allocation of FFO to the Company as a result of assumed increase in the number of common shares outstanding. The Series B shares impacted only the 2003 results as they were converted or redeemed during 2003.
(K)
Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of September 30, 2004. Discontinued Joint Venture Interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold or consolidated.
(L)
Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We generally amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
