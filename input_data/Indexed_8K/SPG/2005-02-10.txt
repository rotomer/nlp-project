Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon Property") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively the "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls, Premium Outlet centers and community shopping centers.
        At December 31, 2004, the Company, directly or through the Operating Partnership, owned or had an interest in 297 properties which consisted primarily of regional malls, Premium Outlet centers, and community shopping centers containing an aggregate of 203 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 40 states plus Puerto Rico. The Company also holds interests in 51 European shopping centers in France, Italy, Poland and Portugal; 4 Premium Outlet centers in Japan; one Premium Outlet center in Mexico; and one shopping center in Canada.
        On October 14, 2004, the Company completed a $5.2 billion (including the assumption of debt) acquisition of Chelsea Property Group, Inc. ("Chelsea"). Chelsea common shareholders received merger consideration of $36.00 in cash; 0.2936 of a share of Simon common stock; and 0.3000 of a share of Simon 6% Series I convertible perpetual preferred stock for each share of Chelsea common stock. At closing, shares and units were issued as follows:

        Chelsea operates as a division of SPG from its headquarters in Roseland, New Jersey, with David Bloom, chief executive officer of Chelsea Property Group, and the Chelsea management team continuing their leadership. David Bloom has been appointed as an Advisory Director of the Simon Property Group Board of Directors.
        Chelsea Property Group is the leading owner, developer and manager of Premium Outlet centers in the U.S. and Asia. Its portfolio includes 36 Premium Outlet centers (31 in the U.S.; 4 in Japan and one in Mexico) located in major metropolitan markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and tourist destinations such as Orlando, Las Vegas and Palm Springs. As of December 31, 2004, the 31 domestic Premium Outlet centers were over 99% occupied and generated sales per square foot of $412. Chelsea's four Premium Outlet centers in Japan, located near Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka, were fully leased and generated sales per square foot of $821 as of December 31, 2004.

        On the next three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro rata basis reflecting the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Real Estate Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        The Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income provides "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio" and reconciles the amounts to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Computation of Comparable Property NOI Growth provides the increase in the comparable regional mall NOI for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaFebruary 10, 2005...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2004:
 - 
Diluted funds from operations ("FFO") of the Simon portfolio for the quarter increased 18.8% to $397.6 million from $334.8 million in 2003. On a per share basis the increase was 7.9% to $1.36 per share from $1.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003. Results for the quarter include a non-cash impairment charge of $18 million ($0.06 per share) for one regional mall. Excluding this charge, FFO for the quarter was $1.42, an increase of 12.7% from 2003. Diluted FFO of the Simon portfolio for the twelve months increased 12.1% to $1.198 billion from $1.069 billion in 2003. On a per share basis the increase was 8.7% to $4.39 per share from $4.04 per share in 2003. Excluding the one-time impairment charge, diluted FFO for the year was $4.46 per share, an increase of 10.4% from 2003.
 - 
Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $107.4 million in 2004 as compared to $165.4 million in 2003. On a diluted per share basis the decrease was 41.0% to $0.49 per share from $0.83 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003. The decline in net income per share is primarily attributable to 2003 net gains on the sale of real estate and the previously described impact of the $18 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net income available to common shareholders for the twelve months decreased to $300.6 million from $313.6 million in 2003. On a diluted per share basis, the decrease was 12.7% to $1.44 per share from $1.65 per share in 2003.
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of GAAP reported net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        The Company's core fundamentals remain strong as evidenced by growth in operating metrics for its three domestic business platforms:
(1)
For mall and freestanding stores
(2)
For all owned gross leasable area (GLA)
(3)
The Company acquired Chelsea Property Group on October 14, 2004. 2003 statistics were calculated based upon the 28 Premium Outlet Centers owned by Chelsea on December 31, 2003.
(4)
For mall and freestanding stores with less than 10,000 square feet
(5)
For all retail stores with less than 50,000 square feet
        "2004 was another productive year for our organization," said David Simon, Chief Executive Officer. "Domestically, we acquired a high quality mall in Puerto Rico and a lifestyle center in Austin, Texas; increased our interests in two existing malls; completed two significant expansion projects; opened two new shopping centers; and at year-end had six new development projects under construction. We also opened four new retail projects outside of the U.S. We capped off the year with the fourth quarter acquisition of Chelsea Property Group, adding a market-leading position in the Premium Outlet business that will serve as a new growth platform to our Company. Our Company is well-positioned for 2005 and we are pleased to announce today a 7.7% increase in our common stock dividend."
Dividends
        Today the Company announced a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.70 per share, an increase of 7.7%. This dividend will be paid on February 28, 2005 to shareholders of record on February 21, 2005.
        The Company also declared dividends on its four outstanding issues of preferred stock:
 -

The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
Notes:
(A)
Includes a $13.5 million loss recorded as a result of the Special Master's memorandum clarifying the calculation of "net profits" that were disgorged by the Company related to the Mall of America litigation. The Company has appealed the Court's September 10, 2003 Order and will appeal the Special Master's findings. Also includes the Company's $12.6 million gain on the sale of its interest in the New York Times Square Westin Hotel (tax effect of the gain of $4.3 million is included in Income tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries below).
(B)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(C)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $21.0 million and $18.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $45.4 million and $42.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(D)
Includes our share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $5.6 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $10.7 million and $6.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(E)
Includes our share of the fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $12.8 million and $4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $38.3 million and $12.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(F)
Includes dividends and distributions of Series B, C and I preferred stock and Series C and I preferred units. The Series B shares impacted only the 2003 results as they were converted or redeemed during 2003.
(G)
Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of December 31, 2004. Discontinued joint venture interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold.
(H)
Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We generally amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
