Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon Property") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively, "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, leasing, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties, primarily regional malls, Premium Outlet centers and community shopping centers.
        At March 31, 2005, the Company owned or had an interest in 296 properties in the United States containing an aggregate of 202 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) in 40 states plus Puerto Rico. The Company also holds interests in 51 European shopping centers in France, Italy, Poland and Portugal; 5 Premium Outlet centers in Japan; one Premium Outlet center in Mexico; and one shopping center in Canada.

        On the next two pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro rata basis reflecting the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        However, you should understand that NOI:
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        The Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income provides "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio" and reconciles the amounts to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Computation of Comparable Property NOI Growth provides the increase in the comparable regional mall NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2005.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaApril 28, 2005...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005:
 - 
Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter increased 18.0% to $57.1 million from $48.4 million in 2004. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 8.3% to $0.26 from $0.24 in the first quarter of 2004.
 - 
Diluted funds from operations ("FFO") of the Simon portfolio for the quarter increased 31.3% to $333.8 million from $254.3 million in 2004. On a per share basis the increase was 16.7% to $1.12 from $0.96 in the first quarter of 2004.
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of GAAP reported net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.
        The Company's core fundamentals continue to demonstrate strength as evidenced by growth in operating metrics for all three domestic business platforms:
(1)
For mall and freestanding stores

For all owned gross leasable area (GLA)

The Company acquired Chelsea Property Group on October 14, 2004.

For all retail stores with less than 50,000 square feet
        "The Company had an exceptional first quarter," said David Simon, Chief Executive Officer. "Our domestic and international business platforms performed well, resulting in 16.7% growth in diluted FFO per share. Our development pipeline is as robust as it has ever been, and all of our new projects are world-class, innovative designs in growing markets. Each project has an exciting tenant line-up with most including residential, office and/or hotel components."

        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and it provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio.
Notes:
(A)
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(B)
Includes our share of gains on land sales of $9.5 million and $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
(C)
Includes our share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $4.1 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
(D)
Includes our share of the fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $13.6 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
(E)
Includes dividends and distributions of Series I preferred stock and Series C and I preferred units.
(F)
Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of March 31, 2005. Discontinued joint venture interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold.
(G)
Excess Investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. We generally amortize excess investment over the life of the related Properties, typically 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
(H)
On January 11, 2005, Metrocenter, a regional mall in Phoenix, Arizona was sold.
