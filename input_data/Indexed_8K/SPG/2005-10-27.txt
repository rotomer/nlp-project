Item 2.02.  Results of Operation and Financial Condition
On October 27, 2005, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of FFO to net income on an estimated and historical basis are provided on page 68 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of NOI to net income on an estimated and historical basis are provided on page 14 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.
The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this Item 2.02, including the Exhibit 99.2.
Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure
On October 27, 2005, the Registrant made available additional ownership and operational information concerning the Registrant, Simon Property Group, L.P., and properties owned or managed as of September 30, 2005, in the form of a Supplemental Information package, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

Basis of Presentation:  The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company.

SIMON PROPERTY GROUP Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income As of September 30, 2005 (in thousands, except as noted)
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
However, you should understand that NOI:
       
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
       
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
       
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
       
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
The Reconciliation of NOI to Net Income provides "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio" and reconciles the amounts to net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Computation of Comparable Property NOI Growth provides the increase in the comparable regional mall NOI for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005.

Properties that were owned in both of the periods under comparison are referred to as comparable properties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SIMON PROPERTY GROUP ANNOUNCES STRONG THIRD QUARTER RESULTS AND DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS
Indianapolis, IndianaOctober 27, 2005...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005:
  Diluted funds from operations ("FFO") of the Simon portfolio for the quarter increased 26.7% to $351.9 million from $277.7 million in 2004. On a per share basis the increase to $1.19 from $1.04 in the third quarter of 2004 was 14.4%. Diluted FFO of the Simon portfolio for the nine months increased 29.3% to $1.035 billion from $800.5 million in 2004.  On a per share basis the increase was 15.9% to $3.49 per share from $3.01 per share in 2004.
  Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter was $74.4 million as compared to $74.1 million in 2004. On a diluted per share basis, earnings decreased 5.6% to $0.34 from $0.36 in the third quarter of 2004. Net income available to common stockholders for the nine months increased 48.1% to $286.2 million from $193.2 million in 2004.  On a diluted per share basis the increase was 38.3% to $1.30 per share from $0.94 per share in 2004. The increase in net income for the nine months is primarily attributable to net gains on the sale of two Chicago office building complexes.
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of GAAP reported net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.

The Company's core fundamentals continue to demonstrate strength as evidenced by strong operating metrics within its three domestic business platforms:
(1)   For mall and freestanding stores.
(2)   For all owned gross leasable area (GLA).
(3)   The Company acquired Chelsea Property Group on October 14, 2004.
(4)   For mall and freestanding stores with less than 10,000 square feet.
"We are pleased to report another quarter of strong financial and operational results," said David Simon, Chief Executive Officer. "Our growth in FFO can be attributed to the productivity of our high quality portfolio, the 2004 acquisition of Chelsea Property Group, and the completion and opening of several new development projects.  During the first ten months of 2005, we opened two open-air regional shopping centers, one community center and two Premium Outlet centersone in the U.S. and one in Japan. Our development pipeline continues to be robust with five additional projects comprising nearly 3 million square feet of gross leasable area under construction and projected to open over the next 12 to 18 months."
