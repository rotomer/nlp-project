ITEM 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
At its meeting on October 26, 2005, the Board of Directors of Simon Property Group, Inc. approved a revised compensation program for non-employee Directors.  The revised program includes changes to the cash components of the annual retainer, committee attendance fees, chairman fees and Lead Director compensation that will become effective January 1, 2006, and changes to the stock-based element of most of those fees that will be subject to approval of amendments to the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan at the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders.
 
The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors requested and received information from an independent compensation consultant on the director compensation practices of fifteen (15) of the Company's real estate peers.  After discussing this information with the consultant, the proposed changes to non-employee Director compensation were recommended by the Governance Committee to the full Board of Directors for action.
 
A summary of non-employee Director compensation reflecting the action of the Board is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
