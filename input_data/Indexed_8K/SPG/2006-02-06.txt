Results of Operation and Financial Condition
Item 2.02.
      
On February 6, 2006, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of FFO to net income on an estimated and historical basis are provided on page 67 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on an estimated and historical basis are provided on page 14 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.
The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC. By furnishing this information, the Registrant makes no admission as to the materiality of any information in this Item 2.02, including the Exhibit 99.2.

The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property.

SIMON PROPERTY GROUP Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI As of December 31, 2005 (in thousands, except as noted)
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
However, you should understand that NOI:
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
 
The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the increase in NOI of regional malls that are comparable properties for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2005.
(1)   Properties that were owned in both of the periods under comparison are referred to as comparable properties.

Notes:
(A)
      
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(B)
       
Includes the Company's share of gains on land sales of $6.8 million and $21.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $32.1 million and $45.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Includes the Company's share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $7.2 million and $5.6 million for the three months ended  December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $22.9 million and $10.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
(D)
      
Includes the Company's share of the fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $22.3 million and $12.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $63.5 million and $38.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
(E)
       
Includes the Company's share of debt premium amortization of $7.3 million and $7.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $30.0 million and $13.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
(F)
        
Includes dividends and distributions of Series I preferred stock and Series C and Series I preferred units.
(G)
     
Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and has, as a result, gained control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of December 31, 2005. Discontinued joint venture interests represent those partnership interests that have been sold.
(H)
     
Relates to Metrocenter, a regional mall in Phoenix, Arizona sold on January 11, 2005, and Forum Entertainment Centre, a property located in Montreal, Canada sold on December 22, 2005.
(I)
           
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures acquired. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 35 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
