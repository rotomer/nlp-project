International Activity
The Company's assets in France and Poland are owned through an investment in a European joint venture. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc. ("Ivanhoe Cambridge"), a preeminent Canadian property owner, manager, developer and investor, acquired a 39.5% ownership interest in the venture that was previously held by another institutional investor. During the first quarter of 2006, Simon and Ivanhoe Cambridge executed a series of transactions to purchase the remaining ownership interests in the venture. Each now owns 50% of the venture, which was renamed Simon Ivanhoe B.V./S.a.r.l. The Company recognized a gain on these transactions of $34.4 million. The gain is included in net income, but does not impact FFO.
Two projects owned by Simon Ivanhoe are currently under constructionone in Poland and one in France. In addition, construction continues on five development projects in Italy, partially owned by Gallerie Commerciali Italia, the Italian joint venture in which the Company owns a 49% interest.

Forward-Looking Statements
Estimates of future net income and FFO per share, and other statements regarding future developments and operations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as "estimated," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," or "will." Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, international, national, regional and local economic climates, competitive market forces, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks associated with acquisitions, the impact of terrorist activities, environmental liabilities, pending litigation, maintenance of REIT status, changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations, changes in market rates of interest and fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies. The reader is directed to the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Funds from Operations ("FFO")
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. A reconciliation of GAAP reported net income to FFO is provided in the financial statement section of this press release.

Notes:
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
(1)
         
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
Includes the Company's share of gains on land sales of $6.6 million and $9.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

SIMON PROPERTY GROUP Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI As of March 31, 2006 (in thousands, except as noted)
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. NOI is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performane that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
However, you should understand that NOI:
      
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
      
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
      
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
      
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
The Reconciliation of Net Income toNOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the increase in NOI of regional malls that are comparable properties for the quarter ended March 31, 2006
.

Properties that were owned in both of the periods under comparison are referred to as comparable properties.
