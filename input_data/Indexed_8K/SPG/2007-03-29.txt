Indianapolis, IN, and San Francisco, CA, March 29, 2007
 Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) ("SPG") and Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C. ("Farallon"), today announced that the $25.25 per share cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock of The Mills Corporation (NYSE: MLS) ("The Mills") by SPG-FCM Ventures, LLC, a joint venture between an entity owned by SPG and funds managed by Farallon, has been successfully completed.
A total of 48,935,908 Mills common shares (including 6,049,663 shares that were tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures) were validly tendered and not withdrawn and have been accepted for payment. These shares represent approximately 86% of the outstanding Mills common shares and, together with shares owned by funds managed by Farallon, represent approximately 96.8% of the outstanding Mills common shares.
The acquisition of The Mills will be completed by means of a merger of a subsidiary of SPG-FCM Ventures and The Mills. In the merger, all outstanding common shares of The Mills (other than shares as to which appraisal rights are perfected under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the same $25.25 in cash per share as paid in the tender offer, without interest. The merger will be implemented on an expedited basis pursuant to the short-form merger procedure available under Delaware law. The merger is expected to occur within the next several days.
