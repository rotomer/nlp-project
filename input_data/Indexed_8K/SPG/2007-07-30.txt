Item 2.02.   Results of Operation and Financial Condition
On July 30, 2007, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of net income to FFO on an estimated and historical basis are provided on pages 62 and 72 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on a historical basis are provided on page 14 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.
The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
Item 7.01.   Regulation FD Disclosure
On July 30, 2007, the Registrant made available additional ownership and operational information concerning the Registrant, Simon Property Group, L.P., and properties owned or managed as of June 30, 2007 in the form of a Supplemental Information package, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

SIMON PROPERTY GROUP Overview
The Company
, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At June 30, 2007, the Company owned or had an interest in 383 properties comprising 258 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.
Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon Property") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively, "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties. Simon Group operates from five retail real estate platforms: regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers
On March 29, 2007, SPG-FCM Ventures, LLC ("SPG-FCM"), a joint venture between an entity owned 50% by the Company and 50% by funds managed by Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C. ("Farallon"), acquired all of the outstanding common stock of The Mills Corporation ("Mills"). As a result, the Company now holds an interest in an additional 38 joint venture properties with approximately 44 million square feet of GLA. A detailed listing of the names and locations of Mills properties acquired is included on page 41. The information in this supplemental information package reflects the ownership of the Mills properties with the exception of NOI composition; operational and statistical information; capital expenditures; and development activity. Prior to March 29, 2007, the Company held a 50% interest in two properties in the Mills portfolio.
This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of June 30, 2007, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability of financing, changes in the Company's credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, impact of terrorist activities, inflation and maintenance of REIT status. The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in its annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that the Company makes. The Company may update that discussion in its period reports, but otherwise the Company undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI
As of June 30, 2007 (in thousands, except as noted)
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
However, you should understand that NOI:
       
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
       
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
       
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
       
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the increase in NOI of regional malls and Premium Outlet Centers that are comparable properties for the quarter and six mont
hs ended June 30, 2007.
(1)
               
Properties that were owned in both of the periods under comparison are referred to as comparable properties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SIMON PROPERTY GROUP ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
AND QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS
Indianapolis, IndianaJuly 30, 2007...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007:
Funds from operations ("FFO") of the Simon portfolio for the quarter increased 4.1% to $373.0 million from $358.4 million in the second quarter of 2006. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 4.0% to $1.31 from $1.26 in 2006. FFO of the Simon portfolio for the six months increased 6.7% to $765.4 million from $717.3 million in 2006. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 6.3% to $2.68 per share from $2.52 per share in 2006.
      
Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter decreased 27.7% to $59.9 million from $82.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. On a diluted per share basis the decrease was 27.0% to $0.27 from $0.37 in 2006. Net income available to common stockholders for the six months decreased 15.3% to $158.3 million from $186.9 million in 2006. On a diluted per share basis the decrease was 15.5% to $0.71 per share from $0.84 per share in 2006. The decrease in net income for the quarter and six months is primarily attributable to higher gains recognized in 2006 on the sale of interests in unconsolidated entities than in 2007 and lower income from unconsolidated entities in 2007. Income from unconsolidated entities was lower in the second quarter of 2007 than the year earlier period primarily as a result of increased depreciation expense attributable to the acquisition of the Mills portfolio of assets.

Notes:
Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and, as a result, gains control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations for those joint ventures held as of June 30, 2007.
(A)
      
Discontinued joint venture interests represent assets and partnership interests that have been sold.
Relates to the sale of Great Northeast Plaza, a community center, on April 25, 2006, and Metrocenter, a regional mall, in January 2005.
(B)
       
As a result of the consolidation of Mall of Georgia during the fourth quarter of 2006 and Town Center at Cobb and Gwinnett Mall as of March 31, 2007, we reclassified our share of the pre-consolidation earnings from these properties.
(C)
       
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures.

Notes:
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
(1)
         
As defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
Includes the Company's share of gains on land sales of $3.7 million and $19.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $11.3 million and $26.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
