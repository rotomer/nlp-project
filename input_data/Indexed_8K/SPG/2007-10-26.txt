Exhibit 3.2
 
AMENDED AND RESTATED
 
SECTION 1.01.  ANNUAL MEETING.  Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Corporation") shall hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to elect directors and transact any other business within its powers, at such place, on such date, and at such time as shall be set by the Board of Directors.  Except as the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "Charter"), these By-Laws, or statute provides otherwise, any business may be considered at an annual meeting without the purpose of the meeting having been specified in the notice.  Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the Corporation's existence or affect any otherwise valid corporate acts.
 
SECTION 1.02. SPECIAL MEETING.  At any time in the interval between annual meetings, a special meeting of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, or a Co-Chairman of the Board or the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting or in writing (addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation) with or without a meeting.
 
SECTION 1.03. PLACE OF MEETINGS.  Meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place in the United States as is set from time to time by the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 1.04. NOTICE OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE.  Not less than ten nor more than 60 days before each stockholders meeting, the Secretary shall give written notice of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting and each other stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting.  The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and, if the meeting is a special meeting or notice of the purpose is required by statute, the purpose of the meeting.  Notice is given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to him, left at his residence or usual place of business, or mailed to him at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, each person who is entitled to notice waives notice if he or she before or after the meeting signs a waiver of the notice which is filed with the records of stockholders'
meetings, or is present at the meeting in person or by proxy (except as otherwise provided by Section 229 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware).
 
SECTION 1.05. QUORUM; VOTING.  Unless any statute or the Charter provides otherwise, at a meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting, except that a plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to elect a director.
 
SECTION 1.06. ADJOURNMENTS.  Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of stockholders convened on the date for which it was called may be adjourned from time to time by a majority vote of the stockholders present in person or by proxy entitled to vote without notice other than by announcement at the meeting.  Any business which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified may be deferred and transacted at any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present.
 
SECTION 1.07. GENERAL RIGHT TO VOTE; PROXIES.  Unless the Charter provides otherwise, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders.  In all elections for directors, each share of stock entitled to vote may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted.  A stockholder may vote the stock he or she owns of record either in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law.  Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than three years after its date.
 
SECTION 1.08. LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS.  The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every election of directors, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open at the place where the election is to be held for said ten days, to the examination of any stockholder, and shall be produced and kept at the time and place of election during the whole time thereof, and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.
SECTION 1.09. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in Section 1.11, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.12. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section and Section 1.12, to declare that such defective nomination or proposal be disregarded.  No person shall be qualified to serve as a director unless nominated in accordance with this Section 1.09.
 
SECTION 1.10. CONDUCT OF VOTING.  At all meetings of stockholders, unless the voting is conducted by inspectors, the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies, the acceptance or rejection of votes and procedures for the conduct of business not otherwise specified by these By-Laws, the Charter or law, shall be decided or determined by the chairman of the meeting.  Unless required by law, no vote need be by ballot and voting need not be conducted by an inspector.  No candidate for election as a director at a meeting shall serve as an inspector thereat.
 
SECTION 1.11.  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS. For any stockholder proposal to be presented in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, including any proposal relating to the nomination of a director to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the stockholders must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date of the Corporation's proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the previous year's meeting, to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made.  Such stockholder's notice
 
shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholders and such beneficial owner.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 2.05.  REGULAR MEETINGS.  After each meeting of stockholders at which directors shall have been elected, the Board of Directors shall meet as soon as practicable for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other business.  In the event that no other time and place are specified by resolution of the Board of Directors, the President, the Chairman of the Board or a Co-Chairman of the Board, with notice in accordance with Section 2.07, the Board of Directors shall meet immediately following the close of, and at the place of, such stockholders' meeting.  Any other regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any place as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 2.06.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, a Co-Chairman of the Board, or the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting, or in writing with or without a meeting.

Unless the By-Laws or a resolution of the Board of Directors provides otherwise, the notice need not state the business to be transacted at or the purposes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors.  No notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need be given to any director who attends except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or to any director who, in writing executed and filed with the records of the meeting either before or after the holding thereof, waives such notice.  Any meeting of the Board of Directors, regular or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and no notice need be given of any such adjourned meeting other than by announcement.
 
SECTION 2.08.  ACTION BY DIRECTORS.  Unless statute or the Charter or By-Laws requires a greater proportion, the action of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is action of the Board of Directors.  A majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum, the directors present by majority vote and without notice other than by announcement may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

SECTION 2.09.  MEETING BY CONFERENCE TELEPHONE.  Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time.

A director who serves the Corporation in any other capacity also may receive compensation for such other services, pursuant to a resolution of the directors.
 
SECTION 2.11.  ADVISORY DIRECTORS.  The Board of Directors may by resolution appoint advisory directors to the Board, who may also serve as directors emeriti, and shall have such authority and receive such compensation and
reimbursement as the Board of Directors shall provide.  Advisory directors or directors emeriti shall not have the authority to participate by vote in the transaction of business.

of stock, or, if none, at the principal office in the State of Delaware or the principal executive offices of the Corporation.
 
SECTION 6.05.  LOST STOCK CERTIFICATES.  The Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine the conditions for issuing a new stock certificate or uncertificated share in place of a stock certificate which is alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, or the Board of Directors may delegate such power to any officer or officers of the Corporation.  In their discretion, the Board of Directors or such officer or officers may refuse to issue such new certificate or uncertificated share save upon the order of some court having jurisdiction in the premises.
 
 
SECTION 7.01.  CHECKS, DRAFTS, ETC.  All checks, drafts and orders for the payment of money, notes and other evidences of indebtedness, issued in the name of the Corporation, shall, unless otherwise provided by resolution of the Board of Directors, be signed by the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice-President or an Assistant Vice-President and countersigned by the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, and except as otherwise prescribed by the Charter or these By-Laws with respect to certificates for shares, the Board of Directors may authorize any officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation.  Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
 
SECTION 8.01. PROCEDURE.  Any indemnification, or payment of expenses, for which mandatory payments must be made under the Charter, in advance of the final disposition of any proceeding, shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days, upon the written request of the director or officer entitled to seek indemnification (the "Indemnified Party").  The right to indemnification and advances hereunder shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Party in any court of competent jurisdiction, if (i) the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition thereof is made within 60 days.  The Indemnified Party's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be reimbursed by the Corporation.  It shall be a defense to any action for advance for expenses that (a) a determination has been made that the facts then known to those making the determination would preclude indemnification or (b) the Corporation has not received both (i) an undertaking as required by law to repay such advances in the event it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met and (ii) a written affirmation by the Indemnified Party of such Indemnified Party's good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Corporation has been met.

All rights to indemnification and advance of expenses under the Charter of the Corporation and hereunder shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this By-Law is in effect.
