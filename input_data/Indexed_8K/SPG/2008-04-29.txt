Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On April 29, 2008, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of net income to FFO on an estimated and historical basis are provided on pages 66 and 75 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on a historical basis are provided on page 13 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon Property") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a subsidiary partnership of the Company. The Company and the Operating Partnership (collectively, "Simon Group") are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties. Simon Group operates from five retail real estate platforms: regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At March 31, 2008, the Company owned or had an interest in 380 properties comprising 259 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of March 31, 2008, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in the Company's credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in its annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that the Company makes. The Company may update that discussion in its period reports, but otherwise the Company undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
        We hope you find this Supplemental Package beneficial. Any questions, comments or suggestions should be directed to: Shelly J. Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations-Simon Property Group, P.O. Box 7033, Indianapolis, IN 46207. Telephone: (317) 685-7330; e-mail:

        On the next two pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting the Company's proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
           However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
           The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the increase in NOI of regional malls and Premium Outlet Centers that are comparable properties for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.

Notes:
(A)
Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and, as a result, gains control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations.
(B)
Discontinued joint venture interests represent assets and partnership interests that have been sold.
(C)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(1)
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
As
defined by NAREIT, FFO is consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of real estate, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting change or resulting from the sale of depreciable real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Includes the Company's share of gains on land sales of $1.2 million and $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
