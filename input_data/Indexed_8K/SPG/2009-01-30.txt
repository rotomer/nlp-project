Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On January 30, 2009, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of net income to FFO on an estimated and historical basis are provided on pages 63 and 72 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on a historical basis are provided on page 14 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc., ("Simon," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. or the Operating Partnership is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties. Simon Group operates from five retail real estate platforms: regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At December 31, 2008, we owned or had an interest in 386 properties comprising 263 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of December 31, 2008, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. We may update that discussion in our periodic reports, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

        On the next three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        
However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        
The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the increase in NOI of regional malls and Premium Outlet Centers that are comparable properties for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaJanuary 30, 2009...Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2008:
 - 
Funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter increased 6.5% to $540.5 million from $507.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 5.7% to $1.86 from $1.76 in 2007. Included in fourth quarter 2008 FFO was an impairment charge of $21.2 million, or $0.07 per share, related to the write-off of certain predevelopment projects that have been abandoned and the write-down of an operating asset to its estimated net realizable value.
 - 
FFO for the twelve months increased 9.5% to $1.852 billion from $1.692 billion in 2007. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 8.8% to $6.42 from $5.90 in 2007.
 - 
Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter increased 28.6% to $145.2 million from $112.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. On a diluted per share basis the increase was 25.5% to $0.64 from $0.51 in 2007.
 - 
Net income available to common stockholders for the twelve months decreased 3.1% to $422.5 million from $436.2 million in 2007. On a diluted per share basis the decrease was 4.1% to $1.87 from $1.95 in 2007.
U.S. Portfolio Statistics(1)
(1)
Statistics do not include the community/lifestyle center properties or the Mills portfolio of assets.
(2)
For mall stores.
(3)
For all owned gross leasable area (GLA).
(4)
For mall stores with less than 10,000 square feet.
        "We are very pleased to report such strong performance, especially in these difficult economic times. It is a testament to our high quality portfolio and strong balance sheet that we delivered FFO growth of 8.8% for the year," said David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We recognized well over a year ago that the economy was deteriorating and adopted aggressive cost control measures, significantly reduced our development spending, and enhanced our liquidity position. The retail environment has been and will continue to be challenging in the upcoming months, however, we are experienced in working through difficult economic cycles. We believe we are positioned to deliver earnings and FFO growth in 2009.
        Our Board of Directors has made the prudent decision to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share in a combination of 10% cash and 90% common stock. We believe this change in composition will fortify one of the industry's strongest balance sheets (rated A-/A3) as it will permit us to retain over $925 million of cash if adopted for all of 2009. This decision is a reflection of our conservative stance on capital allocation and liability management and is not in response to the current retail operating environment."
Dividends
        Today the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the declaration of a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.90 per share, consisting of a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock. The Company intends that the aggregate cash component of the dividend will not exceed 10% in the aggregate, or $0.09 per share. The dividend is payable on March 18, 2009 to stockholders of record on February 12, 2009.
        Paying 90% of the 2009 dividend in shares of SPG common stock allows SPG to satisfy its REIT taxable income distribution requirement while enhancing its already considerable financial flexibility and balance sheet strength.
        In accordance with the provisions of IRS Revenue Procedure 2008-68, stockholders may elect to receive payment of the dividend all in cash or all in common shares. To the extent that more than 10% of cash is elected, the cash portion will be prorated. Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in
cash will receive a cash payment of at least $0.09 per share. Stockholders who do not make an election will receive 10% in cash and 90% in common stock.
        The Company expects the dividend to be a taxable dividend to its stockholders, without regard to whether a particular stockholder receives the dividend in the form of cash or shares, and reserves the right to pay the dividend entirely in cash.
        The number of shares issued as a result of the dividend will be calculated based on the volume weighted average trading prices of the Company's common stock on March 11, March 12 and March 13, 2009.
        An information letter and election form will be mailed to stockholders of record promptly after February 12, 2009. The properly completed election form to receive cash or common shares must be received by the Company's transfer agent prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on March 10, 2009. Registered stockholders with questions regarding the dividend election may call BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, the Company's transfer agent, at (800) 454-9768. If your shares are held through a bank, broker or nominee, and you have questions regarding the dividend election please contact such bank, broker or nominee, who will also be responsible for distributing to you the letter and election form and submitting the election form on your behalf.
        The Company also declared dividends on its two outstanding public issues of preferred stock:
 - 
6% Series I Convertible Perpetual Preferred (NYSE:SPGPrI) dividend of $0.75 per share is payable on February 27, 2009 to stockholders of record on February 13, 2009.
 - 
8/% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred (NYSE:SPGPrJ) dividend of $1.046875 per share is payable on March 31, 2009 to stockholders of record on March 17, 2009.

2009 Guidance
        After giving effect to the estimated impact of paying up to 90% of the Company's 2009 common stock dividends in common stock, the Company estimates that diluted FFO will be within a range of $6.40 to $6.60 per share for the year ending December 31, 2009, and diluted net income will be within a range of $1.95 to $2.15 per share.
        The Company's 2009 guidance estimates are based upon its internal budgeting and planning process and management's view of current market and economic conditions, including those in the retail real estate business. The Company's expectations also reflect the weaker retail environment and weakened state of the U.S. economy, as well as the current dislocation in the U.S. capital markets.
        The 2009 guidance assumes comparable property NOI growth for the following operating portfolios:
        The 2009 guidance assumes an interest rate environment that is consistent with the current forward yield curves for one month LIBOR and the 10 Year U.S. Treasury note and makes certain assumptions on debt spreads. The guidance assumes no future acquisition or disposition activities other than the impact in 2009 from 2008 activity.
        This guidance is a forward-looking statement and is subject to the risks and other factors described elsewhere in this release.
        The following table provides the reconciliation of the range of estimated diluted net income available to common stockholders per share to estimated diluted FFO per share.
For the year ending December 31, 2009

Notes:
(A)
Consolidation occurs when the Company acquires an additional ownership interest in a joint venture and, as a result, gains control of the joint venture. These interests have been separated from operational interests to present comparative results of operations.
(B)
Discontinued joint venture interests represent assets and partnership interests that have been sold.
(C)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(1)
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
