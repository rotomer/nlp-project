Such registration statement covers the registration of the Securities under the 1933 Act.  Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file with the Commission a prospectus supplement to the prospectus of the Company that is a part of the aforementioned registration statement in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B ("Rule 430B") of the 1933 Act Regulations and paragraph (b) of Rule 424 ("Rule 424(b)") of the 1933 Act Regulations, and deliver such prospectus supplement and prospectus to the Underwriters, for use by the Underwriters in connection with their solicitation of purchases of, or offering of, the Securities.

The Company will also supply the Underwriters with such information as is necessary for the determination of the legality of the Securities for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may request.

SECTION 7.  .
Contribution
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement.
 
The relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Operating Partnership.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and the Operating Partnership.
 
(5)           The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and compliance by the Company and the Operating Partnership with their respective obligations under this Agreement does not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under (i) any  provisions of the Charter and by-laws of the Company or the certificate or agreement of limited partnership of the Operating Partnership; (ii) any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation of Delaware; or (iii) to such counsel's knowledge, any Delaware order or Delaware administrative or court decree, binding upon the Company or the Operating Partnership or to which the Company or the Operating Partnership is subject, except, in the case of (ii) and (iii) above, for conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults that in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

The certificates to be used to evidence the Securities will, at the Closing Time and each Additional Closing Time, be in proper form and will comply with applicable Delaware law, the Charter, the by-laws of the Company and the requirements of the NYSE. No holder of such Securities will be subject to personal liability by reason of being such a holder.

(12)         The Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information and the Prospectus Supplement, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus

(14)         The Securities are duly listed, and admitted and authorized for trading on the NYSE, subject only to official notice of issuance.

In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement,  the Prospectus Supplement and the General Disclosure Package, such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and the independent public accountants for the Company and the Operating Partnership at which the contents of the Prospectus Supplement, the General Disclosure Package and related matters were discussed.  On the basis of such participation and review, but without independent verification by such counsel of, and, other than with respect to opinion paragraphs (7) and (10) above, without assuming any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus Supplement and the General Disclosure Package or any amendments or supplements thereto, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that would lead such counsel to believe that the Original Registration Statement or any amendment thereto (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), at the time such Original Registration Statement or any such amendment became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that the Registration Statement, including the Rule 430B Information (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or that the Prospectus Supplement or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for financial statements, the schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), as of the time the Prospectus
 
Supplement was issued, at the time any such amended or supplemented Prospectus Supplement was issued or at the Closing Time or Additional Closing Time, as the case may be, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  In addition, nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead us to believe that the General Disclosure Package, other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  With respect to statements contained in the General Disclosure Package, any statement contained in any of the constituent documents shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that any information contained in subsequent constituent documents modifies or replaces such statement.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.

(the "Corporation") shall hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to elect directors and transact any other business within its powers, at such place, on such date, and at such time as shall be set by the Board of Directors.  Except as the Restated Charter of the Corporation (the "Charter"), these By-Laws, or statute provides otherwise, any business may be considered at an annual meeting without the purpose of the meeting having been specified in the notice.  Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the Corporation's existence or affect any otherwise valid corporate acts.
 
SECTION 1.02. SPECIAL MEETING.  At any time in the interval between annual meetings, a special meeting of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting or in writing (addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation) with or without a meeting.

The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and, if the meeting is a special meeting or notice of the purpose is required by statute, the purpose of the meeting.  Notice is given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to him, left at his residence or usual place of business, or mailed to him at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, each person who is entitled to notice waives notice if he or she before or after the meeting signs a waiver of the notice which is filed with the records of stockholders' meetings, or is present at the meeting in person or by proxy (except as otherwise provided by
Section 229 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware).
 
SECTION 1.05. QUORUM; VOTING.  Unless any statute or the Charter provides otherwise, at a meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting, except that a plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to elect a director under those circumstances described in Section 2.02 of these By-Laws.
 
SECTION 1.06. ADJOURNMENTS.  Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of stockholders convened on the date for which it was called may be adjourned from time to time by a majority vote of the stockholders present in person or by proxy entitled to vote without notice other than by announcement at the meeting.  Any business which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified may be deferred and transacted at any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present.
 
SECTION 1.07. GENERAL RIGHT TO VOTE; PROXIES.  Unless the Charter provides otherwise, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders.  In all elections for directors, each share of stock entitled to vote may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted.  A stockholder may vote the stock he or she owns of record either in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law.  Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than three years after its date.
 
SECTION 1.08. LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS.  The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every election of directors, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open at the place where the election is to be held for said ten days, to the examination of any stockholder, and shall be produced and kept at the time and place of election during the whole time thereof, and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business; and (c) if the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person intends, or is part of a group that intends, to solicit proxies in support of such proposal, a representation to that effect.
 
Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws, the Charter, or any applicable law to the contrary, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.09 and to declare that any defective proposal be disregarded.
 
For purposes of these By-Laws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed to the Secretary of the Corporation and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the first anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the previous year's meeting, to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such
annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made.  In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
 
Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined in Section 1.09 of these By-Laws) of such stockholder, (i) the name and address of such stockholder and any Stockholder Associated Person, (ii) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and any Stockholder Associated Person as of the date such notice is given, and (iii) any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the stockholder and any Stockholder Associated Person and whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss or to manage risk of stock price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to the shares of stock of the Corporation; and (c) if the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person intends, or is part of a group that intends, to solicit proxies in support of such nominees, a representation to that effect.
 
To be eligible to be a nominee for election as a director of the Corporation, the person proposed to be nominated must also deliver or mail to the Secretary within ten (10) days of delivery of the notice of nomination contemplated in the preceding paragraph an executed questionnaire (in the form available from the Secretary) with respect to the background and qualification of such person to serve as a director of the Corporation and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made and an executed representation and agreement (in the form available from the Secretary) that such person (A) is not and will not become a party to (1) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a "Voting Commitment") that has not been disclosed to the Corporation
or (2) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with such person's fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed in the representation and agreement, and (C) if elected as a director of the Corporation, would comply with the Corporation's requirements for ownership of its shares of stock within ninety (90) days after being elected and will comply with all other applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation.
 
No person nominated by any stockholder shall be qualified to serve as a director unless the nomination is made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10.  Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws, the Charter, or any applicable law to the contrary, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a director was nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein and to declare that any defective nomination be disregarded.
 
SECTION 1.11. CONDUCT OF VOTING.  At all meetings of stockholders, unless the voting is conducted by inspectors, the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies, the acceptance or rejection of votes and procedures for the conduct of business not otherwise specified by these By-Laws, the Charter or law, shall be decided or determined by the chairman of the meeting.  Unless required by law, no vote need be by ballot and voting need not be conducted by an inspector.  No candidate for election as a director at a meeting shall serve as an inspector thereat.
 
SECTION 2.01.  FUNCTION OF DIRECTORS.  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors.  All powers of the Corporation may be exercised by or under authority of the Board of Directors, except as conferred on or reserved to the stockholders by statute or by the Charter or By-Laws.
 
SECTION 2.02.  NUMBER AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AND TERM OF OFFICE.  The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by a duly adopted resolution of the Board of Directors, but shall in no event exceed the maximum number of Directors provided in the Charter. Subject to the
rights of the holders of preferred stock to elect any directors voting separately as a class or series, at each annual meeting of stockholders, the directors to be elected at the meeting shall be chosen by the majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at the meeting, provided a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, then directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote, provided a quorum is present. For purposes of this Section 2.02, a "majority of votes cast" shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election. If a nominee fails to receive the required vote and is an incumbent director, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors, subject to acceptance by the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee (or the Nominating and Governance Committee if those Committees have been combined) will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Governance Committee's (or the Nominating and Governance Committee's) recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Governance Committee (or the Nominating and Governance Committee) in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision may each consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Governance Committee (or the Nominating and Governance Committee) or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If an incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors, or if a nominee fails to receive the required vote and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of Article FIFTH of the Charter or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.2.
 
The election of directors by the shareholders shall be by written ballot if directed by the chairman of the meeting or if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
 
If the holders of preferred stock are entitled to elect any directors voting separately as a class or series, those directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of preferred stock entitled to vote in the election at the meeting, provided a quorum of the holders of shares of preferred stock is present.

Subject to the rights of the holders of any class of Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors shall be filled by a vote of the stockholders or a majority of the directors in office on the Board of Directors.  Any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or other cause shall be filled in accordance with paragraph (b) of Article FIFTH of the Charter.
 
SECTION 2.05.  REGULAR MEETINGS.  After each meeting of stockholders at which directors shall have been elected, the Board of Directors shall meet as soon as practicable for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other business.  In the event that no other time and place are specified by resolution of the Board of Directors, the President, the Chairman of the Board, with notice in accordance with Section 2.07, the Board of Directors shall meet immediately following the close of such stockholders' meeting.  Any other regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any place as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 2.06.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, or the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting, or in writing with or without a meeting.

appear on the records of the Corporation, at least 72 hours before the time of the meeting.  Unless the By-Laws or a resolution of the Board of Directors provides otherwise, the notice need not state the business to be transacted at or the purposes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors.  No notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need be given to any director who attends except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or to any director who, in writing executed and filed with the records of the meeting either before or after the holding thereof, waives such notice.  Any meeting of the Board of Directors, regular or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and no notice need be given of any such adjourned meeting other than by announcement.
 
SECTION 2.08.  ACTION BY DIRECTORS.  Unless statute or the Charter or By-Laws requires a greater proportion, the action of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is action of the Board of Directors.  A majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum, the directors present by majority vote and without notice other than by announcement may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

Directors who are employees of the Corporation need not be paid for attendance at meetings of the board or committees thereof for which fees are paid to other directors.  A director who serves the Corporation in any other capacity also may receive compensation for such other services, pursuant
to a resolution of the directors.
 
SECTION 2.11.  ADVISORY DIRECTORS.  The Board of Directors may by resolution appoint advisory directors to the Board, who may also serve as directors emeriti, and shall have such authority and receive such compensation and reimbursement as the Board of Directors shall provide.

SECTION 3.02.  COMMITTEE PROCEDURE.  Each committee may fix rules of procedure for its business.  A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of those present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the committee.  Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of a committee may be taken without a meeting, if a unanimous written consent which sets forth the action is signed by each committee member and filed with the minutes of the committee.

It shall be in such form, not inconsistent with law or with the Charter, as shall be approved by the Board of Directors or any officer or officers designated for such purpose by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Each certificate may be sealed with the actual corporate seal or a facsimile of it or in any other form and the signatures may be either manual or facsimile signatures.  A certificate is valid and may be issued whether or not an officer who signed
it is still an officer when it is issued.  A certificate may not be issued until the stock represented by it is fully paid.  Notwithstanding the above, the issuance of uncertificated shares shall not affect shares already represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation.
 
SECTION 6.02.  TRANSFERS.  The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates of stock or uncertificated shares; and may appoint transfer agents and registrars thereof.  The duties of transfer agent and registrar may be combined.
 
SECTION 6.03.  RECORD DATES.  The Board of Directors may set a record date for the purpose of making any proper determination with respect to stockholders, including which stockholders are entitled to notice of a meeting, vote at a meeting, receive a dividend, or be allotted other rights.  The record date may not be prior to the close of business on the day the record date is fixed nor, subject to Section 1.06, more than 60 days before the date on which the action requiring the determination will be taken; and, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, the record date shall be at least ten days before the date of the meeting.
 
SECTION 6.04. STOCK LEDGER.  The Corporation shall maintain a stock ledger which contains the name and address of each stockholder and the number of shares of stock of each class which the stockholder holds.  The stock ledger may be in written form or in any other form which can be converted within a reasonable time into written form for visual inspection.  The original or a duplicate of the stock ledger shall be kept at the offices of a transfer agent for the particular class of stock, or, if none, at the principal office in the State of Delaware or the principal executive offices of the Corporation.
 
SECTION 6.05.  LOST STOCK CERTIFICATES.  The Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine the conditions for issuing a new stock certificate or uncertificated share in place of a stock certificate which is alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, or the Board of Directors may delegate such power to any officer or officers of the Corporation.  In their discretion, the Board of Directors or such officer or officers may refuse to issue such new certificate or uncertificated share save upon the order of some court having jurisdiction in the premises.
SECTION 7.01.  CHECKS, DRAFTS, ETC.  All checks, drafts and orders for the payment of money, notes and other evidences of indebtedness, issued in the name of the Corporation, shall, unless otherwise provided by resolution of the Board of Directors, be signed by the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice-President or an Assistant Vice-President, the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.

SECTION 7.03.  DIVIDENDS.  If declared by the Board of Directors at any meeting thereof, the Corporation may pay dividends on its shares in cash, property, or in shares of the capital stock of the Corporation, unless such dividend is contrary to law or to a restriction contained in the Charter.
 
SECTION 7.04. CONTRACTS.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, and except as otherwise prescribed by the Charter or these By-Laws with respect to certificates for shares, the Board of Directors may authorize any officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation.  Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
 
SECTION 8.01. PROCEDURE.  Any indemnification, or payment of expenses, for which mandatory payments must be made under the Charter, in advance of the final disposition of any proceeding, shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days, upon the written request of the director or officer entitled to seek indemnification (the "Indemnified Party").  The right to indemnification and advances hereunder shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Party in any court of competent jurisdiction, if (i) the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition thereof is made within 60 days.  The Indemnified Party's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be reimbursed by the Corporation.  It shall be a defense to any action for advance for expenses
that (a) a determination has been made that the facts then known to those making the determination would preclude indemnification or (b) the Corporation has not received both (i) an undertaking as required by law to repay such advances in the event it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met and (ii) a written affirmation by the Indemnified Party of such Indemnified Party's good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Corporation has been met.
 
SECTION 8.02.  EXCLUSIVITY, ETC.  The indemnification and advance of expenses provided by the Charter and these By-Laws shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advance of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), or any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or other provision that is consistent with law, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation, shall continue in respect of all events occurring while a person was a director or officer after such person has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of such person.  All rights to indemnification and advance of expenses under the Charter of the Corporation and hereunder shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this By-Law is in effect.  Nothing herein shall prevent the amendment of this By-Law, provided that no such amendment shall diminish the rights of any person hereunder with respect to events occurring or claims made before its adoption or as to claims made after its adoption in respect of events occurring before its adoption.  Any repeal or modification of this By-Law shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification or advance of expenses of such director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to events occurring, or claims made, while this By-Law or any provision hereof is in force.
 
SECTION 8.03.  SEVERABILITY; DEFINITIONS. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Article VIII shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. The phrase "this By-Law" in this Article VIII means this Article VIII in its entirety.
 
SECTION 9.01.  BOOKS AND RECORDS.  The Corporation shall keep correct and complete books and records of its accounts and transactions and minutes of the proceedings
of its stockholders and Board of Directors and of any executive or other committee when exercising any of the powers of the Board of Directors.  The books and records of a Corporation may be in written form or in any other form which can be converted within a reasonable time into written form for visual inspection.  Minutes shall be recorded in written form but may be maintained in the form of a reproduction.  The original or a certified copy of the By-Laws shall be kept at the principal office of the Corporation.
 
SECTION 9.02.  CORPORATE SEAL.  The Board of Directors shall provide a suitable seal, bearing the name of the Corporation, which shall be in the charge of the Secretary.  The Board of Directors may authorize one or more duplicate seals and provide for the custody thereof.  If the Corporation is required to place its corporate seal to a document, it is sufficient to meet the requirement of any law, rule, or regulation relating to a corporate seal to place the word "Seal" adjacent to the signature of the person authorized to sign the document on behalf of the Corporation.
 
SECTION 9.03.  BONDS.  The Board of Directors may require any officer, agent or employee of the Corporation to give a bond to the Corporation, conditioned upon the faithful discharge of his duties, with one or more sureties and in such amount as may be satisfactory to the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 9.04. VOTING UPON SHARES IN OTHER CORPORATIONS.  Stock of other corporations or associations, registered in the name of the Corporation, may be voted by the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice-President, or a proxy appointed by either of them.  The Board of Directors, however, may by resolution appoint some other person to vote such shares, in which case such person shall be entitled to vote such shares upon the production of a certified copy of such resolution.
 
SECTION 9.05.  NOTICES.  (a) Whenever, under any provisions of these By-Laws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, the same shall be given in writing, either (a) deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the stockholder's last known post office address as shown by the stock record of the Corporation or its transfer agent or (b) by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, except to the extent prohibited by Section 232(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any consent to receive notice by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation.
 
(b)           Any notice required to be given to any Director may be given by the method stated in (a) above. Any such notice, other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent to such post office address, facsimile number or electronic mail address as such Director
shall have provided to the Secretary of the Corporation. It shall not be necessary that the same method of giving notice be employed for all Directors.
 
(c)           If there is no post office address of a stockholder or Director, such notice may be sent to the office of the Corporation.
 
(d)           All notices given by mail shall be deemed to have been given at the time of mailing. All notices given to stockholders by a form of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by facsimile, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (i) such posting and (ii) the giving of such separate notice; and (d) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. All notices given to Directors by a form of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been given when directed to the electronic mail address, facsimile number, or other location filed in writing by the director with the Secretary of the Corporation.
 
(e)           Whenever notice is to be given to the Corporation by a stockholder under any provision of law or of the Charter or these By-Laws, such notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. If delivered by electronic mail or facsimile, the stockholder's notice shall be directed to the Secretary at the electronic mail address or facsimile number, as the case may be, specified in the Corporation's most recent proxy statement.
 
(f)  When used in these By-Laws, the terms "written" and "in writing" shall include any "electronic transmission", as defined in Section 232(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, including without limitation any telegram, cablegram, facsimile transmission and communication by electronic mail.
 
SECTION 9.06.  EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS.  A person who holds more than one office in the Corporation may not act in more than one capacity to execute, acknowledge, or verify an instrument required by law to be executed, acknowledged, or verified by more than one officer.
 
SECTION 9.07.  RELIANCE.  Each director, officer, employee and agent of the Corporation shall, in the performance of his or her duties with respect to the Corporation, be
fully justified and protected with regard to any act or failure to act in reliance in good faith upon the books of account or other records of the Corporation, upon an opinion of counsel or upon reports made to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees or by the adviser, accountants, appraisers or other experts or consultants selected by the Board of Directors or officers of the Corporation, regardless of whether such counsel or expert may also be a director.
 
SECTION 9.08.  CERTAIN RIGHTS OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.  The directors shall have no responsibility to devote their full time to the affairs of the Corporation.  Any director or officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, in his or her personal capacity or in a capacity as an affiliate, employee, or agent of any other person, or otherwise, may have business interests and engage in business activities similar to or in addition to those of or relating to the Corporation.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the Charter, these By-Laws may be repealed, altered or amended or new By-Laws adopted at any meeting of the stockholders, either annual or special, by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors.  The Board of Directors shall also have the authority to repeal, alter or amend these By-Laws or adopt new By-Laws (including, without limitation, the amendment of any By-Laws setting forth the number of directors who shall constitute the whole Board of Directors) by unanimous written consent or at any annual, regular, or special meeting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of directors, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal such By-Laws.
