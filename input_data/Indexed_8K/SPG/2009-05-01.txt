Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On May 1, 2009, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO").

The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of net income to FFO on an estimated and historical basis are provided on pages 62 and 69 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on a historical basis are provided on page 13 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.

        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

Simon Property Group, L.P. or the Operating Partnership is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties. Simon Group operates from five retail real estate platforms: regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At March 31, 2009, we owned or had an interest in 386 properties comprising 262 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of March 31, 2009, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC.

(1)
In the first quarter of 2009, the Company paid a common stock dividend of $0.90 per share, consisting of a combination of 10% cash and 90% shares of the Company's common stock.
        On the next two pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        
However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        
The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the increase in NOI of regional malls and Premium Outlet Centers that are comparable properties for the three months ended March 31, 2009.

(3)
For all owned gross leasable area (GLA).
(4)

        "The first quarter of 2009 was very positive for our Company. We delivered excellent growth in profits, a testament to the stable performance of franchise retail assets within our regional mall, Premium Outlet and Mills platforms," said David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We
also strengthened our balance sheet, one of the strongest in the industry, by raising over $1.6 billion of capital. These continue to be uncertain economic times, but I am very pleased with our performance."
Dividends
        After a thorough review, the Company's Board of Directors has decided that the annual common stock dividend will be reduced to the minimum amount required to distribute 100% of its taxable income. This amount is currently estimated to be approximately $2.70 per share in 2009. On March 18, 2009, the Company paid a dividend of $0.90 per share and expects to pay three quarterly dividends of $0.60 per share for the remainder of 2009.
        Accordingly, the Company announced today that the Board of Directors approved the declaration of a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.60 per share, consisting of a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock. The Company intends that the cash component of the dividend will not exceed 20% in the aggregate, or $0.12 per share. The cash component of the dividend was increased by $0.03 per share from the first quarter dividend. The dividend is payable on June 19, 2009 to stockholders of record on May 14, 2009.
        In accordance with the provisions of IRS Revenue Procedure 2008-68, stockholders may elect to receive payment of the dividend all in cash or all in common shares. To the extent that more than 20% of cash is elected, the cash portion will be prorated. Stockholders who elect to receive the dividend in cash will receive a cash payment of at least $0.12 per share. Stockholders who do not make an election will receive this dividend 20% in cash and 80% in common stock.
        The Company expects the dividend to be a taxable dividend to its stockholders, without regard to whether a particular stockholder receives the dividend in the form of cash or shares, and reserves the right to pay the dividend entirely in cash.
        The number of shares issued as a result of the dividend will be calculated based on the volume weighted average trading prices of the Company's common stock on June 10, June 11 and June 12, 2009.
        An information letter and election form will be mailed to stockholders of record promptly after May 14, 2009. The properly completed election form to receive cash or common shares must be received by the Company's transfer agent prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on June 9, 2009. Registered stockholders with questions regarding the dividend election may call BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, the Company's transfer agent, at (800) 454-9768. If your shares are held through a bank, broker or nominee, and you have questions regarding the dividend election please contact such bank, broker or nominee, who will also be responsible for distributing to you the letter and election form and submitting the election form on your behalf.
        Today the Company also declared dividends on its two outstanding public issues of preferred stock:
 - 
6% Series I Convertible Perpetual Preferred (NYSE:SPGPrI) dividend of $0.75 per share is payable on May 29, 2009 to stockholders of record on May 15, 2009.

2009 Guidance
        The Company adjusted its guidance for 2009 today, estimating that diluted FFO will be within a range of $6.05 to $6.20 per share for the year, and that diluted net income will be within a range of $1.45 to $1.60 per share. The revision is principally the result of the estimated impact of the March 2009 common stock and unsecured debt offerings, which were not contemplated in original guidance provided in January of 2009.
        This guidance is a forward-looking statement and is subject to the risks and other factors described elsewhere in this release.
        The following table provides the reconciliation of the range of estimated diluted net income available to common stockholders per share to estimated diluted FFO per share.
For the year ending December 31, 2009

Supplemental Materials and Financial Statements
        The Company will publish a supplemental information package which will be available at www.simon.com in the Investor Relations section, Financial Information tab. It will also be furnished to the SEC as part of a current report on Form 8-K. If you wish to receive a copy via mail or email, please call 800-461-3439.
        The Company's financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment to ARB 51
("FAS 160") which became effective for us on January 1, 2009. The financial statements also reflect certain reclassifications related to the applicability of EITF Topic D-98,
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities
("D-98"). The adoption of FAS 160 and the Company's concurrent review of the application of D-98 resulted in the reclassification of noncontrolling interests within the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets, and the classification outside of permanent equity for any redeemable securities not meeting the requirements for permanent equity. The adoption of FAS 160 also resulted in the reclassifications of noncontrolling
interests in the consolidated statement of operations. None of these reclassifications had any effect on our net income attributable to common stockholders or per share amounts previously reported.

Notes:
(A)
Discontinued joint venture interests represent assets and partnership interests that have been sold.
(B)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(1)
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operation as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
