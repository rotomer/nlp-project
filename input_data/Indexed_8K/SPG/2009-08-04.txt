Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On August 4, 2009, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of net income to FFO on an estimated and historical basis are provided on pages 65 and 73 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on a historical basis are provided on page 15 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure

The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc., ("Simon," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties. Simon Group operates from five retail real estate platforms: regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At June 30, 2009, we owned or had an interest in 385 properties comprising 262 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of June 30, 2009, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, changes in value of investments in foreign entities, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. We may update that discussion in our periodic reports, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

(5)
For FFO purposes.
(6)
Net of forfeitures.
(1)
In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $140.5 million representing the other than temporary decline in value of its investment in Liberty International, PLC. Reconciliations of Diluted EPS to Diluted EPS (before impairment charge) and Diluted FFOPS to Diluted FFOPS (before impairment charge) are as follows:
(2)
In the first quarter of 2009, the Company paid a common stock dividend of $0.90 per share, comprised of 10% cash and 90% shares of the Company's common stock. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company paid a common stock dividend of $0.60 per share, comprised of 20% cash and 80% shares of the Company's common stock.
 
        On the next three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        
However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        
The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the increase in NOI of regional malls and Premium Outlet Centers that are comparable properties for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009.
(1)
Properties that were owned in both of the periods under comparison are referred to as comparable properties.
(1)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        Indianapolis, IndianaAugust 4, 2009 ... Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Simon") (NYSE:SPG) today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Funds from operations ("FFO") for the quarter were $313.1 million, or $0.96 per share diluted. Results for the quarter were impacted by a non-cash impairment charge of $0.42 per share. Excluding the impact of this charge, FFO was $453.6 million, or $1.38 per share diluted. FFO for the second quarter of 2008 was $427.9 million, or $1.49 per share diluted.
        In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $140.5 million, or $0.42 per share diluted, representing the decline in the value of the Company's investment in Liberty International, PLC ("Liberty"). As of June 30, 2009, the Company owned 35.4 million shares at a weighted average price of 574 pence. Liberty's quoted market price as of June 30, 2009 was 397 pence. As of August 3, 2009, Liberty shares were trading at 436 pence.
        FFO for the second quarter of 2009 reflects dilution of $0.14 per share as a result of the issuance of 17.25 million shares of common stock by the Company in March and an additional 23 million shares in May of 2009.
        Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 was $(20.8) million, or $(0.08) per share diluted. Excluding the impact of the non-cash impairment charge, net income attributable to common stockholders was $93.9 million, or $0.35 per share diluted. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 was $76.6 million, or $0.34 per share diluted.
        "Our operating fundamentals remained sound, which resulted in a solid second quarter in the face of a difficult retail environment," said David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our 2009 capital activity, including the issuance of 40.25 million shares of common stock and $1.25 billion of unsecured notes, strengthened one of the industry's leading balance sheets and resulted in a current liquidity position of approximately $6 billion, including $2.9 billion of cash. The cash raised through these transactions demonstrated the Company's ability to access capital and positions SPG for future growth."

Supplemental Materials and Financial Statements
        The Company will publish a supplemental information package which will be available at www.simon.com in the Investor Relations section, Financial Information tab.

        The Company's financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment to ARB 51
("FAS 160") which became effective for us on January 1, 2009. The financial statements also reflect certain reclassifications related to the applicability of EITF Topic D-98,
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities
("D-98"). The adoption of FAS 160 and the Company's concurrent review of the application of D-98 resulted in the reclassification of noncontrolling interests within the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets, and the classification outside of permanent equity for any redeemable securities not meeting the requirements for permanent equity. The adoption of FAS 160 also resulted in the reclassifications of noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statement of operations. None of these reclassifications had any effect on our net income attributable to common stockholders or per share amounts previously reported.

Funds from Operations ("FFO")
        The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

Notes:
(A)
Discontinued joint venture interests represent assets and partnership interests that have been sold.
(B)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(1)
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
