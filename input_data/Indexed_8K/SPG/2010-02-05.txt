Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On February 5, 2010, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of net income to FFO on an estimated and historical basis are provided on pages 66 and 73 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on a historical basis are provided on page 15 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure
        On February 5, 2010, the Registrant made available additional ownership and operational information concerning the Registrant, Simon Property Group, L.P., and properties owned or managed as of December 31, 2009 in the form of a Supplemental Information package, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.

Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc., ("Simon," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties. Simon Group operates from five retail real estate platforms: regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At December 31, 2009, we owned or had an interest in 382 properties comprising 261 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.
        On December 8, 2009, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outlet shopping center business of Prime Outlets Acquisition Company and certain of its affiliated entities ("Prime Outlets") in a transaction valued at approximately $2.325 billion, including the assumption of Prime Outlets' existing indebtedness and preferred stock. Prime Outlets is an owner, manager, operator and developer of outlet centers in the U.S. The Prime Outlets portfolio includes 22 outlet centers.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of December 31, 2009, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, changes in value of investments in foreign entities, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. We may update that discussion in our periodic reports, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges aggregating $88.1 million, net of tax benefit and adjusted for noncontrolling interest holders' share, related to two operational regional malls, certain parcels of land and non-retail real estate, and certain predevelopment costs related to projects no longer being pursued. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $140.5 million, representing the decline in the value of the Company's investment in Liberty International, PLC.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, a non-cash impairment charge of $21.2 million was recorded related to one operational regional mall and the write-off of certain predevelopment projects that were abandoned. Reconciliations of Diluted EPS (as adjusted) to Diluted EPS and Diluted FFOPS (as adjusted) to Diluted FFOPS are as follows:
(2)
In the first quarter of 2009, the Company paid a common stock dividend of $0.90 per share, comprised of 10% cash and 90% shares of the Company's common stock. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company paid a common stock dividend of $0.60 per share, comprised of 20% cash and 80% shares of the Company's common stock.
 
        On the next three pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for minority interests.
        
Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
        
However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
        
The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the change in NOI of regional malls and Premium Outlet Centers that are comparable properties for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.

Properties that were owned in both of the periods under comparison are referred to as comparable properties.

The equity consideration to Prime Outlets' owners will generally be comprised of 80% in cash and 20% in common partnership units of the Company's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P. ("SPGLP"), which will be based on a ten day trading average of the Company's common stock shortly before closing, subject to a 10% collar.
        Prime Outlets is an owner, manager, operator and developer of outlet centers in the U.S. The Prime Outlets portfolio includes 22 outlet centers.
Financing
        On December 8, 2009, the Company announced that SPGLP entered into a new unsecured corporate credit facility providing an initial revolving borrowing capacity of $3.565 billion, an increase to the prior $3.5 billion revolver. The new facility contains an accordion feature allowing borrowing capacity to increase to as much as $4.0 billion and will mature on March 31, 2013. The base interest rate on the new facility is LIBOR plus 210 basis points, and it includes a money market competitive bid option program that allows SPGLP to hold auctions at lower pricing for short-term borrowings.
        As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $4.3 billion of cash on hand, including its share of joint venture cash, and an additional $3.1 billion of available capacity on SPGLP's corporate credit facility.
        During January of 2010, the following capital market activities were completed:
 - 
On January 19th, the Company announced the sale by SPGLP of $2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes in an underwritten public offering. Net proceeds from the offering were used to fund SPGLP's purchase of senior unsecured notes tendered in an any and all cash tender offer launched on January 12th. The notes offering received exceptionally strong interest with book orders totaling $10 billion. The notes offering consisted of:
 - 
$400 million of 4.20% notes due 2015; priced at 99.78% of the principal amount to yield 4.25% to maturity
 - 
$1.25 billion of 5.65% notes due 2020; priced at 99.62% of the principal amount to yield 5.70% to maturity
 - 
$600 million of 6.75% notes due 2040; priced at 99.44% of the principal amount to yield 6.79% to maturity
The weighted average duration of the notes offering is 14.4 years and the weighted average coupon is 5.69%.
 - 
On January 20th, SPGLP's tender offer expired and on the following day, the Company announced that approximately $2.285 billion of notes were tendered and accepted for purchase. These notes had a weighted average remaining duration of 2.0 years and a weighted average coupon of 5.76%. A $166 million charge to earnings was recorded in January of 2010 in connection with this transaction.
        "This recent capital market activity was well executed," said David Simon. "We believe that it is a testament to our Company's financial strength that we were able to expand the size of our new credit facility while extending the term to 2013, and that we obtained a significant extension of duration of our senior unsecured notes portfolio with no overall increase in our weighted average interest rate through our concurrent tender offer and sale of unsecured notes. With over $7 billion of available liquidity, we are exceptionally well-positioned."
Sale of Simon Ivanhoe
        The Company and Ivanhoe Cambridge (50/50 partners in Simon Ivanhoe, one of the Company's two European joint venture investment entities) announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement to sell their interests in Simon Ivanhoe (which owns seven shopping centers located in France and Poland) to Unibail-Rodamco. Simon and Ivanhoe Cambridge are to receive consideration of 715 million for the assets, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Simon
expects the sale to result in a gain of approximately $300 million. The transaction is scheduled to close during the first half of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
        Simon and Ivanhoe Cambridge have also agreed to venture with Unibail-Rodamco in the development of five retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe development pipeline. Simon will own a 25% interest in this pipeline.

2010 Guidance
        The Company estimates that FFO as adjusted will be within a range of $5.72 to $5.87 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2010, and diluted net income will be within a range of $2.58 to $2.73 per share. FFO as adjusted excludes the impact of a $166 million charge ($0.47 per share) in the first quarter related to SPGLP's January tender offer. After giving effect to this charge, the Company expects 2010 FFO per diluted share to be within a range of $5.25 to $5.40.
        This guidance is based upon the following assumptions:
 - 
Completion of the Prime Outlets acquisition in spring 2010
 - 
Completion of the sale of interest in Simon Ivanhoe during the first half of 2010
 - 
No other acquisition or disposition activity
 - 
An interest rate environment consistent with the current forward curve for LIBOR and U.S. Treasuries
 - 
Comparable property NOI growth for the Company's core domestic portfolios of 1 to 1.5%
        This guidance is a forward-looking statement and is subject to the risks and other factors described elsewhere in this release.
        The following table provides the reconciliation of the range of estimated diluted net income available to common stockholders per share to estimated diluted FFO per share.
For the year ending December 31, 2010

Notes:
(A)
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges aggregating $88.1 million, net of tax benefit and adjusted for noncontrolling interest holders' share, related to two operational regional malls, certain parcels of land and non-retail real estate, and certain predevelopment costs related to projects no longer being pursued. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $140.5 million, representing the decline in the value of the Company's investment in Liberty International, PLC.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, a non-cash impairment charge of $21.2 million was recorded related to one operational regional mall and the write-off of certain predevelopment projects that were abandoned.
(B)
In accordance with ASC 805, acquisition-related costs are required to be expensed as incurred for transactions entered into after January 1, 2009.
(C)
Discontinued joint venture interests represent assets and partnership interests that have been sold.
(D)
The Company's share of impairment charge from unconsolidated entities is included within the joint venture statements of operations. This charge is presented separately on the consolidated statement of operations along with $35.1 million of impairment charges of investments in certain unconsolidated entities and for which declines in value below our carrying amount were deemed other than temporary.
(E)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(1)
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Includes the Company's share of gains on land sales of $17.7 million and $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $19.9 million and $21.6 million (including $9.4 million as a result of the disposition of an investment in a 50% owned multi-family residential facility adjacent to one of our retail operating properties) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
