Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On April 30, 2010, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The press release and Supplemental Information package attached as Exhibit 99.1 use the non-GAAP financial measure of Funds from Operations ("FFO"). The Supplemental Information package also uses the non-GAAP measure of Net Operating Income ("NOI"). The Registrant considers FFO and NOI key measures of its operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Registrant believes that FFO and NOI are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and provide relevant bases for comparison among REITs. The Registrant also uses FFO and NOI internally to measure the operating performance of its portfolio. Reconciliations of net income to FFO on an estimated and historical basis are provided on pages and furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.2. Reconciliations of net income to NOI on a historical basis are provided on page 14 furnished herewith in Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc., ("Simon," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties including regional malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At March 31, 2010, we owned or had an interest in 381 properties comprising 261 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of March 31, 2010, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Beginning with the first quarter of 2010, we modified the reporting of statistics for our U.S. businesses by combining the Company's regional malls and Premium Outlets. We made this change for several reasons including (1) it is more representative of Simon's enterprise performance, as combined, these portfolios represent over 86% of our net operating income, (2) the historically bright line between malls and outlets is becoming more blurred every day as many tenants are leasing space in both property types, and (3) we consolidated the back-of-house operations for our outlets into our Indianapolis infrastructure last year.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, changes in value of investments in foreign entities, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. We may update that discussion in our periodic reports, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
        We hope you find this Supplemental Package beneficial. Any questions, comments or suggestions should be directed to: Shelly J. Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations-Simon Property Group, P.O. Box 7033, Indianapolis, IN 46207. Telephone: (317) 685-7330; e-mail:

(6)
Based upon the weighted average stock price for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
(1)
During the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a $165.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Reconciliations of Diluted EPS as adjusted to Diluted EPS and Diluted FFOPS as adjusted to Diluted FFOPS are as follows:
(2)
In the first quarter of 2009, the Company paid a common stock dividend of $0.90 per share, comprised of 10% cash and 90% shares of the Company's common stock.
 
        On the following two pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for noncontrolling interests.
         Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties on an unleveraged basis. Net Operating Income ("NOI") is a standard industry performance measure which is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, both calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We consider NOI to be a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use NOI internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
         However, you should understand that NOI:
 - 
does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,
 - 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance,
 - 
is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, and
 - 
is not indicative of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
         The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the change in NOI of comparable properties for the three months ended March 31, 2010.

2010 Guidance
        Today the Company increased the low-end of the guidance for 2010 provided on February 5, 2010, estimating that FFO as adjusted will be within a range of $5.77 to $5.87 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2010, and diluted net income will be within a range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. FFO as adjusted excludes the impact of a $165.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt ($0.47 per diluted share) in the first quarter related to SPGLP's January tender offer. After giving effect to this charge, the Company expects 2010 FFO per diluted share to be within a range of $5.30 to $5.40.
        This guidance is a forward-looking statement and is subject to the risks and other factors described elsewhere in this release.
        The following table provides the reconciliation of the range of estimated diluted net income available to common stockholders per share to estimated diluted FFO per share and estimated diluted FFO per share to estimated diluted FFO as adjusted per share.
        This guidance assumes completion of the acquisition of all of the outlet shopping center business of Prime Outlets Acquisition Company and certain of its affiliated entities in the second quarter of 2010, and excludes gains and losses from asset sales.

Notes:
(A)
In accordance with ASC 805, acquisition-related costs are required to be expensed as incurred for transactions entered into after January 1, 2009.
(B)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Notes:
(1)
The Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP and believes that FFO is helpful to investors because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. The Company also uses this measure internally to measure the operating performance of the portfolio. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
