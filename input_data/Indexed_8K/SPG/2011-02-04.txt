Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On February 4, 2011, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure
        On February 4, 2011, the Registrant made available additional ownership and operational information concerning the Registrant, Simon Property Group, L.P., and properties owned or managed as of December 31, 2010 in the form of a Supplemental Information package, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
        This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), FFO as adjusted, diluted FFO per share, diluted FFO per share as adjusted, and net operating income ("NOI"). FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. FFO as adjusted, and diluted FFO per share as adjusted measures exclude the effect of certain non-cash impairment and debt-related charges. We believe these measures provide investors with a basis to compare our current operating performance with previous periods in which we did not have those charges. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
        The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.
        Reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this report to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included.

The Company

Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties including regional malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At December 31, 2010, we owned or had an interest in 393 properties comprising 264 million square feet of gross leasable area in North America, Europe and Asia.

        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. We may update that discussion in our periodic reports, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

A similar calculation was performed for noncontrolling interests.

          This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), FFO as adjusted, diluted FFO per share, diluted FFO per share as adjusted, net operating income ("NOI"), and comparable property NOI. FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. FFO as adjusted and diluted FFO per share as adjusted measures exclude the effect of certain non-cash impairment and debt-related charges. We believe these measures provide investors with a basis to compare our current operating performance with previous periods in which we did not have those charges. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
          The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.
          Reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this report to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the following tables.
Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to FFO and FFO as Adjusted Including Per Share Amounts(1)
Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI
          The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the change in NOI of comparable properties for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2010.
(1)
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Consolidated Net Income includes:
 - 
the Company's share of gains on land sales of $2.4 million and $17.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $11.8 million and $19.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 -

 - 
the Company's share of the amortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $5.1 million and $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $19.9 million and $24.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Notes:
(A)
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded an $8.2 million non-cash impairment charge related to an investment in an operating property in Italy. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges aggregating $88.1 million, net of tax benefit and adjusted for noncontrolling interest holders' share, related to two operational regional malls, certain parcels of land and non-retail real estate, and certain development costs related to projects no longer being pursued. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $140.5 million.
(B)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
(C)
The Company's share of impairment charge from unconsolidated entities is included within the joint venture statements of operations. This charge is presented separately on the consolidated statements of operations along with $35.1 million of impairment charges of investments in certain unconsolidated entities and for which declines in value below our carrying amount were deemed other than temporary.
Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to FFO and FFO as Adjusted
Notes:
(1)
This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), FFO as adjusted, FFO per share and FFO as adjusted per share. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. As adjusted measures exclude the effect of certain non-cash impairment and debt-related charges. We believe these measures provide investors with a basis to compare our current operating performance with previous periods in which we did not have those charges. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
