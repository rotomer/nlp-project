Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On April 29, 2011, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure
        On April 29, 2011, the Registrant made available additional ownership and operational information concerning the Registrant, Simon Property Group, L.P., and properties owned or managed as of March 31, 2011 in the form of a Supplemental Information package, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
        This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), FFO as adjusted, diluted FFO per share, diluted FFO per share as adjusted and net operating income ("NOI"). FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. FFO as adjusted and diluted FFO per share as adjusted measures exclude the effect of certain non-cash impairment and debt-related charges. We believe these measures provide investors with a basis to compare our current operating performance with previous periods in which we did not have those charges. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
        The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.
        Reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this report to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included.

Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc., ("Simon," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties including regional malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers and international properties. At March 31, 2011, we owned or had an interest in 392 properties comprising 263 million square feet in North America, Europe and Asia.
        This package was prepared to provide (1) ownership information, (2) certain operational information, and (3) balance sheet information as of March 31, 2011, for the Company and the Operating Partnership. During the quarterly period ended March 31, 2011, we made changes to the method and presentation of certain of our operational statistics. The methods and discussion regarding these changes are included within the Operational Information sections included on pages 20-24 of this report.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, changes in value of investments in foreign entities, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. We may update that discussion in our periodic reports, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
        We hope you find this Supplemental Package beneficial. Any questions, comments or suggestions should be directed to: Shelly J. Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations-Simon Property Group, P.O. Box 7033, Indianapolis, IN 46207. Telephone: (317) 685-7330; e-mail:

        On the following pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for noncontrolling interests.
(1)
See pages 16-18 for additional reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.
(1)

        This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), FFO as adjusted, diluted FFO per share, diluted FFO per share as adjusted, net operating income ("NOI"), and comparable property NOI. FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. FFO as adjusted and diluted FFO per share as adjusted measures exclude the effect of certain non-cash impairment and debt-related charges. We believe these measures provide investors with a basis to compare our current operating performance with previous periods in which we did not have those charges. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
        The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.
        Reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this report to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the following tables.
Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to FFO and FFO as Adjusted Including Per Share Amounts(1)
Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI
        The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and reconciles the amounts to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the change in NOI of comparable properties for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
(1)
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Consolidated Net Income includes:
 - 
the Company's share of gains on land sales of $2.7 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 - 
the Company's share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $7.3 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 - 
the Company's share of the amortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $5.8 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 - 
the Company's share of debt premium amortization of $2.6 million and $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Does not include community/lifestyle centers, properties owned by SPG-FCM (the Mills portfolio), international properties, properties acquired in the Prime Outlets transaction, any of our non-retail holdings, or results of our corporate and management company operations. Excludes lease termination income, interest income, land sale gains and the impact of redevelopment activities.

Ending Occupancy is the percentage of GLA which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for regional mall anchors and regional mall majors in the calculation.

In accordance with the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, only stores with less than 10,000 square feet are included for regional malls. All company owned space is included for Premium Outlets.
(4)
Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in Ending Occupancy as defined above.
(5)
Releasing Spread is a "same space" measure that compares opening and closing rates on individual spaces, including spaces greater than 10,000 square feet. The Opening Rate is the average of the initial cash Total Rent per Square Foot for spaces leased during the trailing 12-month period, and includes new leases and existing tenant renewals, amendments and relocations (including expansions and downsizings). The Closing Rate is the average of the final cash Total Rent per Square Foot as of the month the tenant terminates or closes. Total Rent per Square Foot includes Base Minimum Rent, common area maintenance ("CAM") and base percentage rent. It includes leasing activity on all spaces occupied by tenants that would qualify to be included in Ending Occupancy as defined above as long as the opening and closing dates are within 24 months of one another.

Development Activity
        On March 17, the Company announced the opening of Paju Premium Outlets, its second Premium Outlet Center in South Korea. The center totals 328,000 square feet with 160 stores, including international and domestic brands.

        The collection of brands at the center includes international luxury brands such as Armani, Coach, Elie Tahari, Escada, Jill Stuart, Lanvin Collection, Marc Jacobs and Vivienne Westwood. Major local brands include Mine, Obzee and Time. Eco-friendly elements were included in the development of Paju Premium Outlets such as solar-energy water-heating and clearstory windows in the parking garage.
        The Company also opened a major expansion of Las Vegas Outlet Center on March 17. The expansion added 13 new stores and approximately 70,000 square feet, bringing the center to more than 140 stores comprising a total of 535,000 square feet. With this expansion, the center was renamed Las Vegas Premium OutletsSouth. The center was also recently renovated, receiving a complete external makeover and significant interior improvements.
        The expansion includes the opening of Coach Men's, Guess, Loft Outlet, Michael Kors, New Balance, True Religion and Under Armour. Several existing stores have relocated to larger spaces within the expansion including Bose, Coach, Fossil, Reebok and Rockport.
        The center has also expanded its parking lot along with upgrading the interior lighting with high-efficiency compact fluorescent fixtures, lowering the center's energy usage and overall carbon footprint. Las Vegas Premium OutletsSouth is 100% owned by the Company.
        During the first quarter, construction started on a 93,000 square foot expansion of Ami Premium Outlets. The Company owns a 40% interest in this center which is located in Ibaraki Prefecture, approximately 34 miles or a 50-minute drive northeast of central Tokyo. The expansion is expected to be completed in December of 2011.
        Construction continues on the following new projects:
 - 
A 52,000 square foot expansion of Tosu Premium Outlets in Fukuoka, Japan, expected to open in July of 2011. The Company owns a 40% interest in this project.
 - 
Johor Premium Outlets, a 173,000 square foot upscale outlet center located in Johor, Malaysia. The center is located one hour's drive from Singapore and is projected to open in November of 2011. The Company owns a 50% interest in this project.

2011 Guidance
        Today the Company provided updated and raised guidance for 2011, estimating that FFO will be within a range of $6.55 to $6.65 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2011, and diluted net income will be within a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share.
        The following table provides a reconciliation of the range of estimated diluted net income available to common stockholders per share to estimated diluted FFO per share.
For the year ending December 31, 2011
        The increase in guidance reflects the improving business conditions in the U.S. retail real estate market, partially offset by uncertainty in Japan as a result of the recent earthquake and tsunami and the ongoing impact to the Japanese economy.

Notes:
(A)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties, typically no greater than 40 years, and the amortization is included in income from unconsolidated entities.
Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to FFO and FFO as Adjusted
Notes:
(1)
This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), FFO as adjusted, FFO per share and FFO as adjusted per share. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. As adjusted measures exclude the effect of certain non-cash impairment and debt-related charges. We believe these measures provide investors with a basis to compare our current operating performance with previous periods in which we did not have those charges. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Includes the Company's share of gains on land sales of $2.7 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(5)
