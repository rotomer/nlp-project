SECTION 7.  .
Contribution
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
The relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriter's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Operating Partnership.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.

In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement,  the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and the independent public accountants for the Company and the Operating Partnership at which the contents of the same and related matters were discussed.  On the basis of such participation and review, but without independent verification by such counsel of, and, other than with respect to opinion paragraphs 7 and 10 above, without assuming any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that would lead such counsel to believe that the Original Registration Statement (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), at the time such Original Registration Statement became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that the Registration Statement, including the Rule 430B Information (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or that the Prospectus (except for financial statements, the schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), as of the time the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities was issued or at the Closing Time or
 
Additional Closing Time, as the case may be, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  In addition, nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead such counsel to believe that the General Disclosure Package, other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement, at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that when the Shares have been issued and delivered in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, including

Simon Property Group, Inc.

Indianapolis, Indiana 46204
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as U. S. federal income tax counsel to Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of up to 9,775,000 shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to the joint Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration Nos. 333-179874 and 333-179874-01 (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company and its subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
 
This opinion letter is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K.
 
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have examined the Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus dated March 2, 2012 and the prospectus supplement dated March 8, 2012 (collectively, the "Prospectus"), the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company and the Eighth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership, each as amended to the date hereof. We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise authenticated to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company, such agreements, certificates of public officials, and certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents, instruments, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
 
We have assumed that the statements and descriptions of the Company's businesses, properties, and intended activities as described in the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated therein by reference are accurate and complete.
 
 
For purposes of rendering the opinions expressed herein, we also have assumed the accuracy of the factual representations contained in the letter from the Company to us dated March 13, 2012, concerning the classification and operation of the Company as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code").
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the following opinions:
 
1.             The Company has been organized and has operated in a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
 
2.             The Company has been organized and has operated in a manner, as described in the Registration Statement and as represented by the Company, so as to enable it to remain qualified as a REIT.
 
3.             The discussion contained in the Prospectus under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations" fairly summarizes the United States Federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Company's common stock.
 
This opinion letter is given as of the date hereof and is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Further, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the Registration Statement may affect the conclusions stated herein. Moreover, the Company's qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon its ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  requirements under the Internal Revenue Code regarding income, distributions and diversity of stock ownership. Because the satisfaction of these requirements depends upon future events, no assurance can be given that the actual results of its operations for any one taxable year will satisfy the tests necessary to remain qualified or be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
 
We express no opinion as to any federal income tax issue or other matter except those set forth or confirmed above.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
