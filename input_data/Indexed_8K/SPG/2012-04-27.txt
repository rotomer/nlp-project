Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
        On April 27, 2012, Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") issued a press release containing information on earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and other matters. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and the information in the press release is incorporated by reference into this report.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.2, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
Item 7.01.    Regulation FD Disclosure
        On April 27, 2012, the Registrant made available additional operational information concerning the Registrant, Simon Property Group, L.P., and properties owned or managed as of March 31, 2012 in the form of a Supplemental Information package, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Supplemental Information package is also available upon request as specified therein.
        The Registrant is furnishing the information contained herein, including Exhibit 99.1, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K promulgated by the SEC. This information shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing with the SEC.
        This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), diluted FFO per share and net operating income ("NOI"). FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
        The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.
        Reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this report to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included.

Exhibit 99.1
The Company
        Simon Property Group, Inc., ("Simon," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") (NYSE:SPG) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is a majority-owned subsidiary partnership of the Company. Together, the Company and the Operating Partnership, or Simon Group, are engaged primarily in the ownership, development and management of retail real estate properties including Malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, Community/Lifestyle Centers and International Properties. At March 31, 2012, we owned or had an interest in 337 properties comprising 244 million square feet in North America and Asia. We also have a 28.7% ownership interest in Klpierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns 271 shopping centers in 13 European countries.
        This package was prepared to provide operational and balance sheet information as of March 31, 2012, for the Company and the Operating Partnership.
        Certain statements made in this Supplemental Package may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, changes in value of investments in foreign entities, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development, expansion, leasing and management of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates, trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties, costs of common area maintenance, intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. We may update that discussion in our periodic reports, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
        We hope you find this Supplemental Package beneficial. Any questions, comments or suggestions should be directed to: Shelly J. Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations-Simon Property Group, P.O. Box 7033, Indianapolis, IN 46207. Telephone: (317) 685-7330; e-mail:

Reporting Calendar
        Results for the next three quarters will be announced according to the following approximate schedule:
Stock Information
        The Company's common stock and one issue of preferred stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the following symbols:
Credit Ratings
(1)
Excludes units owned by the Company (shown here as Company Common Shares) and Operating Partnership units not exchangeable for common shares.
(2)
Excludes Operating Partnership preferred units relating to Company preferred stock outstanding (see Schedule of Preferred Stock/Units Outstanding on page 54).
(3)
Represents restricted stock awards and earned LTIP units issued pursuant to the Operating Partnership's 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, net of forfeitures.
(4)
For Funds from Operations (FFO) purposes.
(5)
Based upon the weighted average stock price for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
 
        On the following pages, we present balance sheet and income statement data on a pro-rata basis reflecting our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in the Simon Group portfolio.
        Basis of Presentation: The consolidated amounts shown are prepared on a consistent basis with our consolidated financial statements. The Company's Share of Joint Ventures column was derived on a property-by-property basis by applying the same percentage interests used to arrive at our share of net income during the period and applying them to all financial statement line items of each property. A similar calculation was performed for noncontrolling interests.
(1)
See pages 15-17 for additional reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.
(1)
Based on Simon Group's share of total NOI and does not reflect any property, entity or corporate-level debt.
(2)
International includes Premium Outlets in Asia and Mexico.
        This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO"), diluted FFO per share, net operating income ("NOI"), and comparable property NOI. FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
        The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities.
        Reconciliations of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this report to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the following tables.
Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to FFO(1)
Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI
        The Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI provides net income and reconciles the amount to "Total NOI of the Simon Group Portfolio." This schedule also provides the change in NOI of comparable properties for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.
(1)
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(2)
Consolidated Net Income includes:
 - 
the Company's share of gains on land sales of $3.2 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 - 
the Company's share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $8.8 million and $7.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 - 
the Company's share of the amortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $5.1 million and $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 - 
the Company's share of debt premium amortization of $6.7 million and $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Total Rent per Square Foot includes Base Minimum Rent, common area maintenance ("CAM") and base percentage rent. It includes leasing activity on all spaces occupied by tenants that would qualify to be included in Ending Occupancy as defined above as long as the opening and closing dates are within 24 months of one another.

Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to FFO
Notes:
(A)
Primarily consists of a non-cash gain resulting from our acquisition activity and represents the remeasurement of our previously held interest to fair value for those properties in which we now have a controlling interest.
(B)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of the Company's investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the partnerships and joint ventures. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties.
(C)
This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), including funds from operations ("FFO") and FFO per share. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). The Company determines FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
(D)
Includes the Company's share of gains on land sales of $3.2 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
(E)
Includes the Company's share of straight-line adjustments to minimum rent of $8.8 million and $7.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
(F)
Includes the Company's share of the amortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions of $5.1 million and $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
(G)
Includes the Company's share of debt premium amortization of $6.7 million and $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
