Exhibit 10.1
1.1
                              
Purpose.
 
The purpose of the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "Plan") is to provide for certain key personnel (as defined in Section 1.3) of Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Partnership") and certain of its Affiliates (as defined in Section 1.6) an equity-based incentive to maintain and enhance the performance and profitability of the Partnership and Simon Property Group, Inc. (the "Company"). It is intended that awards granted under this Plan may provide performance-based compensation within the meaning of section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder from time-to-time (the "Code"), to the extent applicable.
 
1.2
                              
Administration.
 
(a)
                                 
The Partnership, acting through the Company as its general partner (the "General Partner"), hereby appoints the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") as administrator of the Plan.  A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present or acts approved in writing by all members of the Committee without a meeting, shall be acts of the Committee. The members of the Committee shall be appointed by and may be changed at any time and from time to time in the discretion of, the Partnership, by action of its General Partner.
 
(b)
                                
The Committee shall have the authority (i) to exercise all of the powers granted to it under the Plan, (ii) to construe, interpret and implement the Plan and any Plan agreements executed pursuant to the Plan, (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules relating to the Plan, (iv) to make any determination necessary or advisable in administering the Plan, and (v) to correct any defect, supply any omission and reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan.
 
(c)
                                 
The determination of the Committee on all matters relating to the Plan or any Plan agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all recipients of awards made under this Plan.
 
(d)
                                
No member of the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award hereunder.
 
1.3
                              
Persons Eligible for Awards.
 
Awards under Articles 2 and 3 of the Plan may be made to such officers, employee-directors, Eligible Directors (as defined in Section 1.6), executive, managerial, professional or other employees, advisors and consultants ("key personnel") of the Partnership or its Affiliates, other than Herbert Simon, as the Committee shall from time to time in its sole discretion select. Eligible Directors may also receive awards as provided in Article 4 of the Plan.
 
1.4
                              
Types of Awards Under Plan.
 
(a)
                                 
Awards may be made under the Plan in the form of (i) stock options ("options"), (ii) stock appreciation rights related to an option ("related stock appreciation rights"), (iii) stock appreciation rights not related to any option ("unrelated stock appreciation rights"), (iv) restricted stock awards, (v) common stock awards and (vi) performance units, including LTIP Units (as defined in Section 1.6), all as more fully set forth herein.
 
(b)
                                
Options granted under the Plan may be either (i) "nonqualified" stock options subject to the provisions of section 83 of the Code or (ii) options intended to qualify for incentive stock option treatment described in Code section 422.
 
(c)
                                 
All options when granted are intended to be nonqualified stock options, unless the applicable Plan agreement explicitly states that the option is intended to be an incentive stock option. If an option is intended to be an incentive stock option, and if for any reason such option (or any portion thereof) shall not qualify as an incentive stock option, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such option (or portion) shall be regarded as a nonqualified stock option appropriately granted under the Plan provided that such option (or portion) otherwise meets the Plan's requirements relating to nonqualified stock options.
 
(d)
                                
In the event the Company or an Affiliate consummates a transaction described in Code section 424(a), persons who become key personnel on account of such transaction may be granted awards in substitution or as a replacement for awards granted by the former employer. The Committee, in its sole discretion and consistent with Code section 424(a), shall determine the terms of the substitute awards.  Any such substitute awards shall be treated in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(3) for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered under the Plan.
 
1.5
                                 
Shares Available for Awards.
 
(a)
                                
Maximum Shares Available.  Subject to Section 1.5(b) and Section 5.6 (relating to adjustments upon changes in capitalization), the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (as defined in Section 1.6) which may be delivered under the Plan pursuant to awards hereunder shall not exceed 17,300,000 shares.    In determining the number of shares of Common Stock to be counted
against
this share reserve in connection with any award, the following rules shall apply:
 
(1)
                                
Where the number of shares subject to an award is variable on the date of grant, the number of shares to be counted against the share reserve prior to the settlement of the award shall be the maximum number of shares that could be received under that particular award.
 
(2)
                                
Where two or more types of awards are granted to a grantee in tandem with each other, such that the exercise of one type of award with respect to a number of shares cancels at least an equal number of shares of the other, the number of shares to be counted against the share reserve shall be the largest number that would be counted against the share reserve under either of the awards.
 
(3)
                                
Substitute awards shall not be counted against the share reserve, nor shall they reduce the shares authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year.
 
(4)
                                
For purposes of these rules, awards that are made in the form of Units (as defined in Section 1.6) or that are convertible into Units, each Unit subject to the award shall be treated as one share of Common Stock.
 
(b)
                                
Effect of Forfeiture and Other Actions.  Any shares of Common Stock or Units subject to an award granted under this Plan that is forfeited or expires or is settled for cash shall, to the extent of such forfeiture, expiration or cash settlement, again become available for awards under this Plan, and correspondingly increase the total number of shares of Common Stock available for grant and issuance
under Section 1.5(a).  The following shares of Common Stock or Units shall not, however, again become available for awards or increase the number of shares available for grant under Section 1.5(a): (i) shares of Common Stock tendered by the grantee or withheld in payment of the purchase price of a stock option issued under this Plan, (ii) shares of Common Stock or Units tendered by the grantee or withheld to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an award under this Plan, (iii) shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company with proceeds received from the exercise of an option issued under this Plan, and (iv) shares of Common Stock subject to a stock appreciation right issued under this Plan that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of that stock appreciation right upon its exercise.
 
(c)
                                 
Source of Shares.  Shares of Common Stock that shall be subject to issuance pursuant to the Plan shall be authorized and unissued or treasury shares of Common Stock.
 
(d)
                                
Substitute Awards.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 5.16, the Committee may, with the grantee's consent, cancel any award under the Plan and issue a new award in substitution therefor upon such terms as the Committee may in its sole discretion determine, provided that the substituted award shall satisfy all applicable Plan requirements as of the date such new award is made.
 
(e)
                                 
Effect of Plans Operated by Acquired Companies.  If a company acquired by the Partnership or any Affiliate or with which the Partnership or any Affiliate combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for grant under the Plan.  Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not employees of the Partnership or any Affiliate or Eligible Directors prior to such acquisition or combination.

Unless the applicable Plan agreement otherwise provides, an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan may be exercised from time to time as to all or part of the full number of shares as to which such option or stock appreciation right shall then be exercisable. No option shall be exercised with respect to less than 50 shares of Common Stock unless the option is being exercised with respect to the full number of shares issuable hereunder.
 
(e)
                                 
Notice of Exercise; Exercise Date.
 
(1)
                                 
An option or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable by the filing of a written notice of exercise with the Partnership, on such form and in such manner as the Committee shall in its sole discretion prescribe, and by payment in accordance with Section 2.6.
 
(2)
                                 
Unless the applicable Plan agreement otherwise provides or the Committee in its sole discretion otherwise determines, the date of exercise of an unrelated stock appreciation right shall be the date the Partnership receives such written notice of exercise.
 
(3)
                                 
For purposes of the Plan, the "option exercise date" shall be deemed to be the sixth business day immediately following the date written notice of exercise is received by the Partnership.
 
(f)
                                   
Cashout of Options. If and to the extent that the applicable Plan agreement so provides: At any time after receipt of written notice of exercise of an option and prior to the "option exercise date" (as defined in Section 2.5(e)), the Committee in its sole discretion may by written notice to the grantee, cancel the option or any part thereof if the Committee in its sole discretion determines that tax, legal or contractual restrictions or brokerage or other market considerations would make the acquisition of Common Stock, or the grantee's sale of Common Stock to the public markets illegal, impracticable or inadvisable. If the Committee cancels such option or any part thereof, the Partnership shall pay to the grantee, as soon as practicable thereafter, an amount equal in cash to the excess of (i) the aggregate fair market value of the shares of Common Stock subject to the option or part thereof canceled (determined as of the option exercise date), over (ii) the aggregate option exercise price of the shares of Common Stock subject to the option or part thereof canceled.
 
2.6
                              
Payment of Option Price.
 
(a)
                                 
Tender Due Upon Notice of Exercise. Unless the applicable Plan agreement otherwise provides or the Committee in its sole discretion otherwise determines, (i) any written notice of exercise of an option shall be accompanied by payment of the full purchase price for the shares being purchased,
and (ii) the grantee shall have no right to receive shares of Common Stock with respect to an option exercise prior to the option exercise date.
 
(b)
                                
Manner of Payment. Payment of the option exercise price shall be made in any combination of the following:
 
(1)
                                 
by certified or official bank check payable to the Company (or the equivalent thereof acceptable to the Committee);
 
(2)
                                 
with the consent of the Committee in its sole discretion, by personal check (subject to collection), which may in the Committee's sole discretion be deemed conditional;
 
(3)
                                 
if and to the extent provided in the applicable Plan agreement, by delivery of previously acquired shares of Common Stock owned by the grantee for at least six months (or such other period as the Committee may prescribe) having a fair market value (determined as of the option exercise date) equal to the portion of the option exercise price being paid thereby, provided that the Committee may require the grantee to furnish an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Committee to the effect that such delivery would not result in the grantee incurring any liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and does not require any Consent (as defined in Section 5.3);
 
(4)
                                 
with the consent of the committee in its sole discretion, by the promissory note and agreement of the grantee providing for payment with interest on the unpaid balance accruing at a rate not less than that needed to avoid the imputation of income under Code section 7872 and upon such terms and conditions (including the security, if any, therefor) as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion; provided, however, no grantee who is subject to Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "S-O Act") may pay pursuant to this clause (iv); or
 
(5)
                                 
by any other means which the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan.
 
(c)
                                 
Cashless Exercise. For any grantee who is not subject to Section 402 of the S-O Act, payment in accordance with clause (i) of Section 2.6(b) may be deemed to be satisfied, if and to the extent provided in the applicable Plan agreement, by delivery to the Company of an assignment of a sufficient amount of the proceeds from the sale of Common Stock acquired upon exercise to pay for all of the Common Stock acquired upon exercise and an authorization to the broker or selling agent to pay that amount to the Company, which sale shall be made at the grantee's direction at the time of exercise.
 
(d)
                                
Issuance of Shares. As soon as practicable after receipt of full payment, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, deliver to the grantee one or more certificates for the shares of Common Stock so purchased, which certificates may bear such legends as the Company may deem appropriate concerning restrictions on the disposition of the shares in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations or otherwise.
 
2.7
                              
Termination of Service.
 
For purposes of the Plan, "termination of service" means, in the case of an employee, the termination of the employment relationship between the employee and the Partnership and all Affiliates; and in the case of an individual who is not an employee, the termination of the service relationship between the individual and the Partnership and all Affiliates. Subject to the other provisions of the Plan and unless the applicable Plan agreement otherwise provides:
(a)
                                 
General Rule. All options and stock appreciation rights granted to a grantee shall terminate upon his termination of service for any reason (including death) except to the extent post-service exercise of the vested portion of an option or stock appreciation right is permitted in accordance with this Section 2.7. The "vested portion" of any option or stock appreciation right shall mean the portion thereof which is exercisable immediately prior to the grantee's termination of service for any reason.
 
(b)
                                
Improper Activity. All options and stock appreciation rights granted to a grantee shall terminate and expire on the day of the grantee's termination of service for cause, whether or not the grantee is a party to a written service contract. For purposes of this Section 2.7, a grantee's service shall be deemed to be terminated for "cause" if he is discharged (i) on account of fraud, embezzlement or other unlawful or tortious conduct, whether or not involving or against the Partnership or any Affiliate, (ii) for violation of a policy of the Partnership or any Affiliate, (iii) for serious and willful acts of misconduct detrimental to the business or reputation of the Partnership or any Affiliate or (iv) for "cause" or any like term as defined in any written contract with the grantee.
 
(c)
                                 
Regular Termination; Leaves of Absence. If the grantee's service terminates for reasons other than as provided in subsection (b) or (d) of this Section 2.7, the portion of options and stock appreciation rights granted to such grantee which were exercisable immediately prior to such termination of service may be exercised until the earlier of (i) 30 days after his termination of service or (ii) the date on which such options and stock appreciation rights terminate or expire in accordance with the provisions of the Plan (other than this Section 2.7) and the Plan agreement; provided, that the Committee may in its sole discretion determine such other period for exercise in the case of an individual whose service terminates solely because the employer ceases to be an Affiliate or the grantee transfers employment with the Partnership's consent to a purchaser of a business disposed of by the Partnership. The Committee may in its sole discretion determine (i) whether any leave of absence (including short-term or long-term disability or medical leave) shall constitute a termination of service for purposes of the Plan, and (ii) the impact, if any, of any such leave on outstanding awards under the Plan. The Committee shall not, however, have the discretion to grant any extension of an exercise or expiration period that would subject the grantee to gross income inclusion, interest, or additional tax pursuant to Code section 409A.
 
(d)
                                
Death; Disability; Retirement. If a grantee's service terminates by reason of death, disability, or retirement at or after age 65, the portion of options and stock appreciation rights granted to such grantee which were exercisable immediately prior to such termination of service may be exercised until the earlier of (i) one year after his termination of service in the case of death or disability or three years after his termination of service by reason of retirement, or (ii) the date on which such options and stock appreciation rights terminate or expire in accordance with the Plan agreement. For purposes of this Section 2.7, the term "disability" shall mean, with respect to any grantee, a "permanent and total disability" as defined in section 22(e)(3) of the Code.
 
2.8
                              
Special ISO Requirements.
 
In order for a grantee to receive special tax treatment with respect to stock acquired under an option intended to be an incentive stock option, the grantee of such option must be, at all times during the period beginning on the date of grant and ending on the day three months before the date of exercise of such option, an employee of the Company or any of the Company's parent or subsidiary corporations (within the meaning of Code section 424), or of a corporation or a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Code section 424(a) applies. The aggregate fair market value, determined as of the date an option is granted, of the Common Stock for which any grantee may be awarded incentive stock options which are first exercisable by the grantee during any calendar year under the Plan (and any other stock option plan to be taken into account under Code section 422(d)) shall not exceed $100,000. If an option granted under the Plan is intended to be an incentive stock option, and if the grantee, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the grantee's employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation, then (i) the option exercise price per share shall in no event be less than 110% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of such grant and (ii) such option shall not be
exercisable after the expiration of five years after the date such option is granted.  The total number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan upon the exercise of incentive stock options shall not exceed 3,000,000 shares.
3.1
                              
Restricted Stock Awards.
 
(a)
                                 
Grant of Awards. The Committee may grant restricted stock awards, alone or in tandem with other awards, under the Plan in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall from time to time in its sole discretion determine. The vesting of a restricted stock award granted under the Plan may be conditioned upon the completion of a specified period of service with the Partnership or any Affiliate, upon the attainment of specified Performance Goals within specified Performance Cycles, and/or upon such other criteria as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion; provided, however; that subject to Section 5.17, every restricted stock award which is based solely on completion of a specified period of service must have a minimum period of service of thirty-six consecutive months and any restricted stock award which is based in whole or in part on the achievement of specified Performance Goals must relate to a Performance Cycle of not less than twelve consecutive months.
 
(b)
                                
Payment. Each Plan agreement with respect to a restricted stock award shall set forth the amount (if any) to be paid by the grantee with respect to such award. If a grantee makes any payment for a restricted stock award which does not vest, appropriate payment may be made to the grantee following the forfeiture of such award on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.
 
(c)
                                 
Forfeiture Upon Termination of Service. Unless the applicable Plan agreement otherwise provides or the Committee otherwise determines, (i) if a grantee's service terminates for any reason (other than death or disability) before all of his restricted stock awards have vested, such unvested awards shall terminate and expire upon such termination of service, and (ii) in the event any condition to the vesting of restricted stock awards is not satisfied within the period of time permitted therefor, such restricted shares shall be returned to the Partnership. If a grantee's service terminates by reason of death or disability any unvested portion of a restricted stock award which has been earned as a result of the attainment of applicable Performance Goals shall be fully vested as of the awardee's date of death or disability.
 
(d)
                                
Issuance of Shares. The Committee may provide that one or more certificates representing restricted stock awards shall be registered in the grantee's name and bear an appropriate legend specifying that such shares are not transferable and are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Plan agreement, or that such certificate or certificates shall be held in escrow by the Partnership on behalf of the grantee until such shares vest or are forfeited, all on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine. Unless the applicable Plan agreement otherwise provides, no share of restricted stock may be assigned, transferred, otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the grantee until such share has vested in accordance with the terms of such award. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.4, as soon as practicable after any restricted stock award shall vest, the Partnership shall issue or reissue to the grantee (or to his designated beneficiary in the event of the grantee's death) one or more certificates for the Common Stock represented by such restricted stock award without such restricted legend.
 
(e)
                                 
Grantees' Rights Regarding Restricted Stock. Unless the applicable Plan agreement otherwise provides, (i) a grantee may vote and receive dividends on restricted stock awarded under the Plan, and (ii) any stock received as a dividend on, or in connection with a stock split of, a restricted stock award shall be subject to the same restrictions as such restricted stock.
3.2
                              
Common Stock Awards.
 
The Committee may issue awards under the Plan, payable in Common Stock, including, but not limited to awards of Common Stock equal to dividends declared on Common Stock, alone or in tandem with other awards, in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall from time to time in its sole discretion determine. Such Common Stock awards under the Plan shall relate to a specified maximum number of shares granted as, or in payment of, a bonus, or to provide incentives or recognize special achievements or contributions.
 
3.3
                              
Performance Units.
 
(a)
                                 
Grant of Units. The Committee may grant performance units under the Plan that include the right to acquire shares of Common Stock or Units exchangeable for Common Stock, along with the right to receive current or on a deferred or contingent basis dividends from the Company or distributions from the Partnership, in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall from time to time in its sole discretion determine, subject to the terms of the Plan and the Partnership Agreement.  Subject to Section 5.17, any performance unit which is based solely on completion of a specified period of service must have a minimum period of service of thirty-six consecutive months, and any performance unit which is based in whole or in part on the achievement of specified Performance Goals must relate to a Performance Cycle of not less than twelve consecutive months.
 
(b)
                                
Terms. Each performance unit under the Plan shall relate to a specified maximum number of shares of Common Stock or Units and shall be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, or cash, as selected by the General Partner (or such other form of consideration equivalent in value thereto as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) at the end of a specified period of time or Performance Cycle on such terms as may be established by the Committee. The number of such shares of Common Stock or Units which may be deliverable pursuant to such performance unit shall be based upon the degree of attainment of Performance Goals over a Performance Cycle or the satisfaction of continuous service vesting requirements on such terms as may be established by the Committee. The Committee may provide for full or partial credit, prior to full vesting of such performance unit, in the event of the participant's death, disability, or such other circumstances, to the extent permitted by Code section 162(m), if applicable, as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion to be fair and equitable to the participant or in the interest of the Partnership and its Affiliates.
 
3.4
                              
Limitation.
 
The total number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards, common stock awards and performance unit awards that are subject to the attainment of Performance Goals granted to any one participant pursuant to the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000 in any calendar year.
4.1
                              
Grants to Eligible Directors.
 
The Committee may grant Eligible Directors of the Company restricted stock awards in accordance with this Article 4.  Grants under this Article 4 may be made on a discretionary basis from time to time or on a continuing basis upon the election or appointment of an Eligible Director as determined by the Committee.
4.2
                              
Amount of Awards.
 
The Committee shall determine the amount of each restricted stock award, which may be made by a reference to the number of shares of Common Stock, a dollar amount to be divided by the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant or a dollar amount to be divided by the average fair market value of the Common Stock over a period of time specified by the Committee.  The Committee may grant additional restricted stock awards to Eligible Directors serving on specified committees of the Board, acting as chairs of any such committee or acting as lead director or any other capacity relating to the Board.
 
4.3
                              
Terms of Restricted Stock Awards.
 
(a)
                                 
Vesting.  Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Plan agreement, each award of restricted stock under this Article 4 shall fully vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant of such award. Except as provided in Section 4.4 as provided otherwise in the Plan agreement or as otherwise determined by the Committee, if an Eligible Director's service as a director terminates before all of his or her restricted stock awards have vested, any unvested portion of an award shall terminate and expire upon such termination of service. If an Eligible Director's service terminates by reason of death or disability or after an Eligible Director has served a minimum of five annual terms as director of the Company, its predecessors or successors, any unvested portion of a restricted stock award, may, upon determination of the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company and subject to the limitations of Section 5.17, become fully vested without completion of the minimum period of service requirement.
 
(b)
                                
Grantee's Rights. A grantee may vote and receive dividends on the restricted stock awards granted hereunder. Any stock or other property paid as a dividend on, or in connection with a stock split of, a restricted stock award, shall be subject to the same restrictions that apply to such restricted stock award.
 
(c)
                                 
Issuance of Shares.  The transfer agent of the Common Stock shall create book entries evidencing the restricted stock awards established in the Eligible Director's name which shall be subject to restrictions on transfer and the terms and conditions of the Plan. No shares of restricted stock may be assigned, transferred, otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the grantee until such award has vested and only after the underlying shares of Common Stock have been released pursuant to Section 4.5 hereof.
 
4.4
                              
Change of Control.
 
The Plan agreement for a restricted stock award under this Article 4 may provide that, in the event of a change of control prior to the date the award fully vests, all shares of restricted stock not previously vested shall become immediately vested and deferred pursuant to Section 4.5.
 
4.5
                              
Deferred Delivery; Reinvestment of Dividends.
 
Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Plan agreement, upon vesting, the delivery of the shares of Common Stock underlying any restricted stock awards shall be deferred in accordance with the terms of the Director Deferred Compensation Plan until an Eligible Director's service as a director of the Company terminates. During the deferral period, all cash dividends payable with respect to such shares of Common Stock shall be reinvested in shares of Common Stock pursuant to terms of the Company's dividend reinvestment plan as in effect from time to time and delivery of any such shares shall also be deferred pursuant to the Director Deferred Compensation Plan.
5.1
                              
Amendment of the Plan; Modification of Awards.
 
(a)
                                 
Plan Amendments. The Partnership, by action of its General Partner, may, without approval of other partners in the Partnership, at any time and from time to time suspend, terminate or amend the Plan in any respect whatsoever, except that no such amendment shall impair any rights under any award theretofore made under the Plan without the consent of the grantee of such award. Furthermore, the General Partner shall submit for stockholder approval any amendment (other than an amendment pursuant to the adjustment provisions of Section 1.6) required to be submitted for stockholder approval by law, regulation or applicable stock exchange requirements or that otherwise would: (i) increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be awarded in Section 1.5(a); (ii) extend the Termination Date (as defined in Section 5.14) of this Plan; or (iii) change the class of persons eligible to be participants. Any Plan amendment shall be obtained in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by applicable law or regulation.
 
(b)
                                
Award Modifications. With the consent of the grantee and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan (including Section 5.1(a)), the Committee may amend outstanding Plan agreements with such grantee, including, without limitation, any amendment which would (i) accelerate the time or times at which an award may vest or become exercisable but only in case of death, disability, retirement or as a result of a change in control and/or (ii) extend the scheduled termination or expiration date of the award; provided, however, that the Committee shall not enter into any amendments of outstanding agreements that would subject the grantee to gross income inclusion, interest, or additional tax pursuant to Code section 409A.
 
5.2
                              
Limitation on Exercise.
 
No option or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable to the extent that such exercise will cause the Partnership or any Affiliate to pay any amount which would be nondeductible by the Partnership or such Affiliate by reason of Code section 162(m).
 
5.3
                              
Restrictions.
 
(a)
                                 
Consent Requirements. If the Committee shall at any time determine in its sole discretion that any Consent (as hereinafter defined) is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of any award under the Plan, the acquisition, issuance or purchase of shares or other rights hereunder or the taking of any other action hereunder (each such action being hereinafter referred to as a "Plan Action"), then such Plan Action shall not be taken, in whole or in part, unless and until such Consent shall have been effected or obtained to the full satisfaction of the Committee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if (i) the Committee may make any payment under the Plan in cash, Common Stock or both, and (ii) the Committee determines that Consent is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, payment in any one or more of such forms, then the Committee shall be entitled to determine not to make any payment whatsoever until such Consent has been obtained.
 
(b)
                                
Consent Defined. The term "Consent" as used herein with respect to any Plan Action means (i) any and all listings, registrations or qualifications in respect thereof upon any securities exchange or other self-regulatory organization or under any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, (ii) the expiration, elimination or satisfaction of any prohibitions, restrictions or limitations under any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation or the rules of any securities exchange or other self-regulatory organization, (iii) any and all written agreements and representations by the grantee with respect to the disposition of shares, or with respect to any other matter, which the Committee shall deem necessary or desirable to comply with the terms of any such listing, registration or qualification or to obtain an exemption from the requirement that any such listing, qualification or registration be made, and
(iv) any and all consents, clearances and approvals in respect of a Plan Action by any governmental or other regulatory bodies or any parties to any loan agreements or other contractual obligations of the Partnership or any Affiliate.
 
5.4
                              
Nontransferability.
 
Except as expressly authorized by the Committee in the Plan agreement, no award granted to any grantee under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable by the grantee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and during the lifetime of the grantee, all rights with respect to any option or stock appreciation right granted to the grantee under the Plan shall be exercisable only by the grantee.
 
5.5
                              
Withholding Taxes.
 
(a)
                                 
Whenever under the Plan shares of Common Stock are to be delivered pursuant to an award, the Committee may require as a condition of delivery that the grantee remit an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state and other governmental withholding tax requirements related thereto. Whenever cash is to be paid under the Plan (whether upon the exercise of stock appreciation right or otherwise), the Partnership may, as a condition of its payment, deduct therefrom, or from any salary or other payments due to the grantee, an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state and other governmental withholding tax requirements related thereto or to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock under the Plan.
 
(b)
                                
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) a grantee may elect to satisfy all or part of the foregoing withholding requirements by delivery of unrestricted shares of Common Stock owned by the grantee for at least six months (or such other period as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion) having a fair market value (determined as of the date of such delivery by the grantee) equal to all or part of the amount to be so withheld, provided that the Committee may require, as a condition of accepting any such delivery, the grantee to furnish an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Committee to the effect that such delivery would not result in the grantee incurring any liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; and (ii) the Committee may permit any such delivery to be made by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the award giving rise to the tax withholding obligation (in which event the date of delivery shall be deemed the date such award was exercised) having a fair market value (determined as of the date of such exercise).
 
5.6
                              
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization.
 
If and to the extent specified by the Committee, the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to awards under the Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to awards, the option exercise price and appreciation base of options and stock appreciation rights theretofore granted under the Plan, and the amount payable by a grantee in respect of an award, shall be appropriately adjusted (as the Committee may determine) for any change in the number of issued shares of Common Stock or outstanding Units resulting from the subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock or Units or other capital adjustments, or the payment of a stock dividend or Partnership distribution in the form of additional Units after the effective date of the Plan, or other change in such shares of Common Stock or Units effected without receipt of consideration; provided that any awards covering fractional shares of Common Stock or Units resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated and provided further, that each incentive stock option granted under the Plan shall not be adjusted in a manner that causes such option to fail to continue to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Code section 422. Adjustments under this Section shall be made by the Committee, whose determination as to what adjustments shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding and conclusive.
5.7
                              
Right of Discharge Reserved.
 
Nothing in the Plan or in any Plan agreement shall confer upon any person the right to continue in the service of the Partnership or any Affiliate or affect any right which the Partnership or any Affiliate may have to terminate the service of such person.
 
5.8
                              
No Rights as a Stockholder.
 
No grantee or other person shall have any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to shares subject to an award until the issuance of a stock certificate to him for such shares. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.6, no adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights (whether ordinary or extraordinary, and whether in cash, securities or other property) for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued. In the case of a grantee of an award which has not yet vested, the grantee shall have the rights of a stockholder of the Company if and only to the extent provided in the applicable Plan agreement.
 
5.9
                              
Nature of Payments.
 
(a)
                                 
Any and all awards or payments hereunder shall be granted, issued, delivered or paid, as the case may be, in consideration of services performed for the Partnership or its Affiliates by the grantee.
 
(b)
                                
No such awards and payments shall be considered special incentive payments to the grantee or, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, be taken into account in computing the grantee's salary or compensation for the purposes of determining any benefits under (i) any pension, retirement, life insurance or other benefit plan of the Partnership or any Affiliate or (ii) any agreement between the Partnership or any Affiliate and the grantee.
 
(c)
                                 
By accepting an award under the Plan, the grantee shall thereby waive any claim to continued exercise or vesting of an award or to damages or severance entitlement related to non-continuation of the award beyond the period provided herein or in the applicable Plan agreement, notwithstanding any contrary provision in any written contract with the grantee, whether any such contract is executed before or after the grant date of the award.
 
5.10
                       
Non-Uniform Determinations.
 
The Committee's determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by it selectively among persons who receive, or are eligible to receive, awards under the Plan (whether or not such persons are similarly situated). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall be entitled, among other things, to make non-uniform and selective determinations, and to enter into non-uniform and selective Plan agreements, as to (a) the persons to receive awards under the Plan, (b) the terms and provisions of awards under the Plan, (c) the exercise by the Committee of its discretion in respect of the exercise of stock appreciation rights pursuant to the terms of the Plan, and (d) the treatment of leaves of absence pursuant to Section 2.7(c).
 
5.11
    
Other Payments or Awards.
 
Nothing contained in the Plan shall be deemed in any way to limit or restrict the Partnership, any Affiliate or the Committee from making any award or payment to any person under any other plan, arrangement or understanding, whether now existing or hereafter in effect.
5.12
    
Reorganization.
 
(a)
                                 
In the event that the Company is merged or consolidated with another corporation and, whether or not the Company shall be the surviving corporation, there shall be any change in the shares of Common Stock by reason of such merger or consolidation, or in the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are acquired by another person, or in the event of a reorganization or liquidation of the Company (each such event being hereinafter referred to as a "Reorganization Event") or in the event that the Board shall propose that the Company enter into a Reorganization Event, then the Committee may in its sole discretion, by written notice to a grantee, provide that his options and stock appreciation rights will be terminated unless exercised within 30 days (or such longer period as the committee shall determine in its sole discretion) after the date of such notice; provided that if the Committee takes such action the Committee also shall accelerate the dates upon which all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights of such grantee shall be exercisable. The Committee also may in its sole discretion by written notice to a grantee provide that all or some of the restrictions on any of his awards may lapse in the event of a Reorganization Event upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.
 
(b)
                                
Whenever deemed appropriate by the Committee, the actions referred to in Section 5.12(a) may be made conditional upon the consummation of the applicable Reorganization Event.
 
5.13
                       
Section Headings.
 
The section headings contained herein are for the purposes of convenience only and are not intended to define or limit the contents of said sections.
 
5.14
                       
Effective Date and Duration of the Plan.
 
(a)
                                 
The Plan shall become effective on the date it is approved by the Company's stockholders, which shall be considered the date of its adoption for purposes of Treasury Regulation 1.422-2(b)(2)(i).  No awards shall be made under the Plan prior to its effective date.  If the Company's stockholders fail to approve the Plan within 12 months of its approval by the Board, the Plan shall be of no further force or effect.
 
(b)
                                
The Plan shall remain in effect until all Shares subject to it shall be distributed, all awards have expired or terminated, the Plan is terminated pursuant to Section 5.1(a), or December 31, 2018, whichever occurs first (the "Termination Date").  Awards made before the Termination Date will continue to be outstanding in accordance with their terms unless limited in the applicable Plan agreement.
 
5.15
                       
Governing Law.
 
THE PLAN SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.
 
5.16
                       
Repricing of Options.
 
Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, or exchange of shares), the terms of outstanding awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding options or stock appreciation rights or cancel outstanding options or stock appreciation rights in exchange for cash, other awards or options or stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original options or stock appreciation rights without stockholder approval.
5.17
                       
Exception to Certain Limitations
 
Notwithstanding the limitations contained in the proviso to the second sentence of Section 3.1(a) and the last sentence of Section 3.3(a) concerning minimum periods of service for vesting or minimum periods for Performance Cycles, restricted stock awards and performance unit awards may be made with vesting periods based on service periods of less than thirty-six consecutive months or Performance Cycles of less than twelve consecutive months as long as the aggregate number of shares subject to such shorter periods does not exceed five percent of the maximum number of shares set forth in Section 1.5(a).
 
5.18
                       
Code Section 409A.
 
(a)
                                 
If as of the date his employment terminates, a grantee is a "key employee" within the meaning of Code section 416(i), without regard to paragraph 416(i)(5) thereof, and if the Company has stock that is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise, any deferred compensation payments otherwise payable under this Plan because of his termination of service (for reasons other than death or disability) will be suspended until, and will be paid to the grantee on, the first day of the seventh month following the month in which the grantee's last day of employment occurs. For purposes of this Plan, "deferred compensation" means compensation provided under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in, and subject to, Code section 409A.
 
(b)
                                
The Plan and any Plan agreements shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the applicable standards for nonqualified deferred compensation plans established by Code section 409A and its interpretive regulations and other regulatory guidance. To the extent that any terms of the Plan or a Plan agreement would subject the grantee to gross income inclusion, interest, or additional tax pursuant to Code section 409A, those terms are to that extent superseded by, and shall be adjusted to the minimum extent necessary to satisfy, the applicable Code section 409A standards.
 
5.19
                       
Rule 16b-3.
 
It is intended that the Plan and all awards granted pursuant to it shall be administered by the Committee so as to permit the Plan and awards to comply with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act Rule.  If any provision of the Plan or of any award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with the intent expressed in this Section 5.19, that provision to the extent possible shall be interpreted and deemed amended in the manner determined by the Committee so as to avoid the conflict.  To the extent of any remaining irreconcilable conflict with this intent, the provision shall be deemed void as applied to grantees subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by law and in the manner deemed advisable by the Committee.
 
5.20
                       
Forfeiture and Compensation Recovery.
 
Awards and any compensation associated therewith may be made subject to forfeiture, recovery by the Company or other action pursuant to any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee at any time, including in response to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder, or as otherwise required by law.  Any Plan agreement may be unilaterally amended by the Committee to comply with any such compensation recovery policy.
