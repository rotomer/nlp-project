Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), and The Melvin Simon Family Enterprises Trust, a trust created under an agreement originally dated October 28, 1990, as amended and restated (the "Trust Agreement") (the "Selling Shareholder"), confirm their respective agreements with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Underwriter") with respect to the sale by the Selling Shareholder and the purchase by the Underwriter of 5,873,620 shares of the Company's common stock, par value of $.0001 per share (the "Common Stock") (said shares to be sold by the Selling Shareholder being herein referred to as the "Securities").
 
The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Selling Shareholder understand that the Underwriter proposes to make a public offering of the Securities in the manner set forth in the Prospectus (as defined below).
 
The Company and the Operating Partnership have jointly prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-179874 and 333-179874-01), including the related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses, which registration statement became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e) of the rules and regulations of the Commission (the "1933 Act Regulations") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").  Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file with the Commission a prospectus supplement to the prospectus of the Company that is a part of the aforementioned registration statement in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B ("Rule 430B") of the 1933 Act Regulations and paragraph (b) of Rule 424 ("Rule 424(b)") of the 1933 Act Regulations, and
deliver such prospectus supplement and prospectus to the Underwriter, for use by the Underwriter in connection with its solicitation of purchases of, or offering of, the Securities.  Any information included in such prospectus supplement that was omitted from such registration statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B is referred to as "Rule 430B Information."  The prospectus of the Company that is part of such registration statement and each prospectus supplement used in connection with the offering of the Securities that omitted Rule 430B Information is herein referred to as a "preliminary prospectus."  Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto to such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by the 1933 Act Regulations, is herein referred to as the "Registration Statement."  The Registration Statement, at the time it originally became effective, is herein referred to as the "Original Registration Statement."  The final prospectus and the final prospectus supplement, in the form first furnished to the Underwriter for use in connection with the offering of the Securities, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement, is herein referred to as the "Prospectus."  For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval ("EDGAR") system.  Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to those terms in the Prospectus.
 
All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the date of this Agreement; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the 1933 Act Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, on or after the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.  .
Contribution
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Selling Shareholder, on the one hand, and of the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Shareholder and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriter, in each case
as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
 
The relative fault of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Selling Shareholder, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Selling Shareholder or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company, the Operating Partnership, the Selling Shareholder and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) the Selling Shareholder shall not be required to contribute in excess of the aggregate gross proceeds after underwriting commissions and discounts, but before expenses, received by the Selling Shareholder from the sale of the Securities sold by the Selling Shareholder under this Agreement.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and the Underwriter's officers, directors, members, Affiliates, employees and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Selling Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Selling Shareholder, as the case may be.
 
The provisions of this Section shall not affect any agreement among the Company and the Selling Shareholder with respect to contribution.
SECTION 8.  .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
 
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Selling Shareholder or authorized representatives of each of the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Selling Shareholder submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling the Underwriter, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Selling Shareholder, and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

On the basis of such participation and review, but without independent verification by such counsel of, and, other than with respect to opinion paragraphs 7 and 10 above, without assuming any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that would lead such counsel to believe that the Original Registration Statement (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), at the time such Original Registration Statement became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that the Registration Statement, including the Rule 430B Information (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriter pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or that the Prospectus (except for financial statements, the schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), as of the time the final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities was issued or at the Closing Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  In addition, nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead such counsel to believe that the General Disclosure Package, other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by
reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement, at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.

Exhibit B
 
Assuming that the Underwriter acquires the Securities from the Selling Stockholder pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement without notice of an adverse claim thereto, upon (a)(i) indication by The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") by book entry that the Securities have been credited to the Underwriter's securities account at DTC or (ii) DTC's acquisition of the Securities for the Underwriter and acceptance of the Securities for the Underwriter's securities account and (b) payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, (y) the Underwriter will acquire a valid security entitlement in respect of the Securities and (z) no action based on an adverse claim to the Securities may be validly asserted against the Underwriter with respect to such security entitlement.  For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "adverse claim", "notice of an adverse claim", "securities account" and "security entitlement" have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in Sections 8-102(a)(1), 8-105, 8-501(a) and 8-102(a)(17) of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New York

(3)
                                
The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement by the Trustee in his capacity as trustee for the Selling Shareholder, the performance by the Selling Shareholder of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder do not require any consents, approvals, waivers, licenses or authorizations or other actions by or filing with any Indiana court or governmental authority.  Such counsel may state that it expresses no opinion regarding any consent, approval, waiver, license, authorization, or other action in connection with any tax laws, federal or state securities and/or blue sky laws (including Indiana's), or anti-trust laws.
As a matter of fact and not as a legal opinion, to such counsel's knowledge, there currently exists no action, proceeding, or investigation before or by any court, governmental agency, or other body or official pending or overtly threatened in writing against the Selling Shareholder questioning the validity of any action by the Trustee in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement. Such counsel may state that it has not made any search of any court or other public records to determine the existence of any of the matters referred to in this paragraph.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as U. S. federal income tax counsel to Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the offer and sale of 5,873,620 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Shares") by the Melvin Simon Family Enterprises Trust pursuant to the joint Registration Statement on Form S-3, Registration Nos. 333-179874 and 333-179874-01 (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company and its subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the prospectus dated March 2, 2012, and the prospectus supplement dated September 19, 2012 (collectively, the "Prospectus").
 
This opinion letter is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K.
 
For purposes of this opinion letter, we have examined the Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company and the Eighth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership, each as amended to the date hereof. We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise authenticated to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company, such agreements, certificates of public officials, and certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents, instruments, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
 
We have assumed that the statements and descriptions of the Company's businesses, properties, and intended activities as described in the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated therein by reference are accurate and complete.
 
For purposes of rendering the opinions expressed herein, we also have assumed the accuracy of the factual representations contained in the letter from the Company to us concerning
 
the classification and operation of the Company as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code").
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the following opinions:
 
1.
                                      
The Company has been organized and has operated in a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
 
2.
                                      
The Company has been organized and has operated in a manner, as described in the Registration Statement and as represented by the Company, so as to enable it to remain qualified as a REIT.
 
3.
                                      
The discussion contained in the Prospectus under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations" fairly summarizes the United States Federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to a holder of the Company's common stock.
 
This opinion letter is given as of the date hereof and is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Further, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the Registration Statement may affect the conclusions stated herein. Moreover, the Company's qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon its ability to meet  through actual annual operating results  requirements under the Internal Revenue Code regarding income, distributions and diversity of stock ownership. Because the satisfaction of these requirements depends upon future events, no assurance can be given that the actual results of its operations for any one taxable year will satisfy the tests necessary to remain qualified or be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
 
We express no opinion as to any federal income tax issue or other matter except those set forth or confirmed above.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
