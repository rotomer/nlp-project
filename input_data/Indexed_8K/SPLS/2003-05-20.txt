Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2003 Sales and Earnings; Company Posts 15 Percent Sales Growth And Two Percent Increase In North American Retail Comparable Sales FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 20, 2003--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its first quarter ended May 3, 2003. Total company sales for the quarter grew to $3.1 billion, an increase of 15 percent versus $2.7 billion reported for the same quarter of the prior year. North American Retail comparable sales increased two percent. The company achieved pro forma net income of $86 million for the quarter, or earnings per share of $0.18, on a diluted basis, exceeding analyst consensus of $0.17. This represents a 29 percent increase over earnings per share of $0.14 reported for the first quarter of 2002, after excluding a $.06 per share one-time tax benefit received in the first quarter of 2002. On a GAAP basis, net income was $25 million or $.05 per share, compared to $.20 per share for the first quarter of 2002, including the one-time tax benefit received in that quarter. Due to the recent change in accounting rules for recording vendor consideration (Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 02-16), the company recorded a one-time, non-cash adjustment, reducing first quarter net income for GAAP purposes by $62 million after taxes. Pro forma net income shows Staples' results as if the company had always been subject to the new accounting method. "Staples delivered another strong quarter, and continues to grow sales profitably while making it easy for our customers to shop for office products," said Ron Sargent, Staples president and CEO. "The bottom line is, execution matters, and Staples' associates are executing better than anyone else in our industry." Highlights of Staples' business units for the first quarter include: North American Retail North American Retail sales for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up seven percent versus first quarter results a year ago. Business unit income was $76 million, up 28 percent versus last year. Staples added 10 new stores in North America this quarter, with nine in the United States and one in Canada. North American Delivery North American Delivery sales for the first quarter were $920 million, a 13 percent increase versus last year's first quarter. Business unit income of $59 million was up 23 percent versus last year's first quarter. Excluding sales from MAP, organic growth was seven percent, leading the industry. Staples' Contract business successfully launched a new version of StaplesLink.com this quarter, growing Internet penetration to 75 percent of all transactions, and added more than 2,700 new accounts. Europe European revenues of $385 million were up 87 percent versus last year's first quarter, including the benefit of foreign currency translation. Sales from the acquired European catalog business added $137 million to the top line, so organic growth in Europe was 20 percent. Business unit income was $9.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.6 million in last year's first quarter. Staples opened three new stores, with two in the UK and one in the Netherlands. Staples European Catalog entered Sweden, expanding the delivery business to seven countries. Outlook For the second quarter of 2003, Staples anticipates earnings per share will be in line with existing analyst estimates. Second quarter revenues are expected to increase in the low double-digit percentage range, with North American Retail comparable sales in the low single digits. For the full year, Staples anticipates pro forma 20 percent earnings growth versus the $0.88 we reported last year. Sales growth is expected to be in the range of mid to high single-digit organic growth, and two to three percent growth from the two recent acquisitions. Low single digit positive North American Retail comps are expected for the full year. The following table reconciles Staples' results on a GAAP basis with results adjusted for the accounting change and the one-time tax benefit. The company uses the adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share to measure operating performance and believes such information is beneficial to an understanding of its results of operations on a comparative basis. 13 Weeks Ended ----------------------------- May 3, 2003 May 4, 2002 ------------ --------------- Net income (in thousands): Net income as reported (GAAP) $24,756 $93,869 Adjustments: Impact of accounting change (net of taxes) 61,724 - Tax benefit - (29,000) ------------ --------------- Net income as adjusted $86,480 $64,869 ------------ --------------- Diluted earnings per share: Diluted earnings per share as reported (GAAP) $0.05 $0.20 Adjustments: Impact of accounting change (net of taxes) 0.13 - Tax benefit - (0.06) ------------ --------------- Diluted earnings per share as adjusted $0.18 $0.14 ------------ --------------- About Staples Staples, Inc. is an $11.6 billion retailer of office supplies, business services, furniture and technology to consumers and businesses from home-based businesses to Fortune 500 companies in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal.
