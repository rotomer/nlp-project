Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports 38 Percent Increase In Second Quarter Earnings Per Share FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 19, 2003-- Company Posts 18 Percent Sales Growth, A Six Percent Increase In North American Retail Comparable Sales, And Raises Full Year Earnings Guidance Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its second quarter ended Aug. 2, 2003. The company achieved a 47 percent increase in net income to $87.8 million for the quarter, or $0.18 per share on a diluted basis. This exceeds analyst consensus of $0.16, and is a 38 percent increase over earnings per share of $0.13 reported for the second quarter of 2002. Total company sales for the quarter grew to $2.87 billion, an increase of 18 percent versus $2.43 billion reported for the same quarter in the prior year. North American Retail comparable sales increased six percent, with strong performance across all categories. "We are seeing tremendous strength and terrific results in every single part of our business," said Ron Sargent, Staples president and chief executive officer. "Staples associates are clearly focused on operational excellence and delivering an easy shopping experience for our customers." The company continues to benefit from its focus on small business customers; the "Back To Brighton" improvement plan to drive profitable sales, margin expansion and asset productivity; and by bringing the "easy" brand promise to life, with improved customer satisfaction. This quarter's highlights include: -- North American Retail sales increased 11 percent for the quarter, driven by strong execution on many levels including a sustained focus on customer service and improved in-stock levels. -- North American Delivery outpaced all major competitors with 14 percent sales growth, or 10 percent organically, as a result of acquiring more than 3000 new contract accounts and strong customer retention in all three delivery businesses. -- Both the European Retail and Delivery businesses had strong sales and were profitable, with Retail posting a four percent increase in comparable sales. -- Operating margins improved across the board. Total company operating margins were 5.03 percent, exceeding the 4.92 percent second quarter historical high achieved in 1999. -- Customer service performance continues to result in the highest retail Mystery Shop and delivery Perfect Order scores in the Company's history. Outlook As a result of the strong momentum in the second quarter and an anticipated second half of the year that will exceed current analyst consensus, Staples is raising earnings guidance on a pro forma basis to $1.09, versus the current analyst consensus of $1.05, for the full year 2003.
