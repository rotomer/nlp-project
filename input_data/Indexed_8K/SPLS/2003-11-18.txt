Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Best Third Quarter In Company History 13 Percent Sales Growth Drives 29 Percent Increase in Earnings FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 18, 2003-- Company Posts a Four Percent Increase in North American Retail Comparable Sales Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its third quarter ended November 1, 2003. The company achieved a 29 percent increase in net income to $166 million for the quarter, or $0.33 per share on a diluted basis. This exceeds analyst consensus of $0.32, and is a 22 percent increase over earnings per share of $0.27 reported for the third quarter of 2002. The company reported industry leading revenue growth, with total company sales for the quarter reaching $3.5 billion, an increase of 13 percent versus $3.1 billion reported for the same quarter in the prior year. North American Retail comparable sales increased four percent, with strong performance in furniture, business machines and services, and a healthy back to school season. North American Delivery sales grew seven percent, maintaining strong momentum. "With eight quarters of more than 20 percent earnings growth and solid improvement in our performance across the board, we continue to execute well against a great market opportunity," said Ron Sargent, Staples' president and chief executive officer. Third quarter highlights include: -- The company generated $424 million in free cash flow year to date. -- Total company operating margins were 7.66 percent, reaching an all-time high for the third quarter. -- North American Retail achieved record profitability for the third quarter, benefiting from an improved product mix, more efficient marketing and good expense control. -- North American Delivery improved its profitability by 16 percent. -- Sales for European Operations increased 56 percent with both retail and delivery profitable for the quarter. "Thanks to the hard work and talent of our 58,000 associates who strive each day to make buying office products easy for our customers, we achieved excellent results across all areas of our business," said Sargent. Outlook For the fourth quarter ending January 31, 2004, the company remains comfortable with current analyst consensus expectations for earnings per share of $0.41. Looking ahead to 2004, Staples anticipates low double-digit sales growth and earnings per share growth to reach 20 percent. North American comparable sales are expected to be in the low single-digit range.
