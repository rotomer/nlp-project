Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2003 Results FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 4, 2004-- Net Income Rose 29 Percent and Revenues Increased 10 Percent in the Fourth Quarter North American Retail Comparable Sales Rose Four Percent for the Quarter and Full-Year Company to Initiate First-Ever Cash Dividend and Commence Stock Repurchase Program Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its fourth quarter and full-year ended January 31, 2004. For the fourth quarter, net income rose 29 percent, compared to the same quarter of 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $0.42 for the quarter, exceeding analyst expectations of $0.41. This is a 20 percent increase over the $0.35 per share achieved in the prior fourth quarter. Total company operating margins rose to 9.26 percent, the best quarterly performance in the company's history. Total company sales for the fourth quarter grew 10 percent, compared to the prior fourth quarter, to $3.7 billion. North American comparable sales exceeded the company's expectations, increasing four percent over the same quarter in 2002. North American Delivery quarterly sales increased eight percent and European operations grew sales 18 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. For fiscal year 2003, the company achieved pro forma net income of $552 million or $1.12 per share on a diluted basis. Pro forma results exclude the adjustment related to the application of EITF 02-16, which reduced the company's first quarter 2003 net income by $62 million, net of taxes. Pro forma net income increased 32 percent from 2002, excluding a non-recurring $29 million tax benefit in the first quarter of 2002. Net income in 2003 increased 10 percent on a GAAP basis from 2002. Sales for the full-year reached $13.2 billion, a 14 percent increase compared to 2002. Full-year North American Retail comparable store sales increased four percent. "I'm incredibly proud of our associates' accomplishments and the progress we made in executing our company-wide objectives for 2003: bringing the easy brand promise to life, improving our supply chain and continuing to drive profitable sales, operating margin improvement and asset productivity," said Ron Sargent, president and CEO. Key company accomplishments in 2003 include: -- Customer service improved in all channels. Mystery shop and Perfect Order scores reached all-time highs. -- The company developed a 14,600 square foot store model with fewer SKU's and a lower cost labor model, driving attractive returns with lower volume stores. -- Worldwide e-commerce sales reached $2.1 billion for the year, an increase of 31 percent over 2002, representing more than half of Staples' worldwide delivery sales. -- Return on net assets climbed to 10.8 percent, exceeding the company's cost of capital. -- The company generated $742 million in free cash flow in 2003, ending the year with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. The company also announced the initiation of an annual cash dividend. The first dividend of $0.20 per share of outstanding common stock will be payable on May 17, 2004, to shareholders of record on April 26, 2004. The company is also authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion in common stock over the next two years, and expects to buy back approximately $400 million in the current year. "Over the last two years we have transformed Staples into more than a growth company," said Sargent. "Our operating results, capital discipline and working capital management have positioned us not only to grow, but also to return some of our excess cash to our loyal shareholders through a dividend and stock repurchase program. Clearly, we are confident that our business will continue its strong financial performance well into the future." Outlook For both the first quarter ending May 1, 2004 and fiscal year 2004, the company expects earnings per share to grow 20 percent. Revenues are expected to increase approximately 10 percent, with North American Retail comparable sales in the low-single digit range.
