EXHIBIT 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2004 Sales Increased 12 Percent; Earnings Per Share Exceed Analyst Consensus By 3 Cents FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 18, 2004-- North American Retail Comparable Sales Rose to an Industry-Leading Five Percent North American Delivery Sales Accelerated in the First Quarter, Growing 11 Percent Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its first quarter ended May 1, 2004. Total company sales for the quarter grew to $3.45 billion, an increase of 12 percent versus $3.09 billion for the same quarter of the prior year. North American Retail comparable sales increased five percent and North American Delivery sales rose 11 percent. The company achieved net income of $126 million for the quarter, or earnings per share of $0.25, on a diluted basis, exceeding analyst consensus of $0.22. This represents a 39 percent increase over pro forma earnings per share of $0.18 reported for the first quarter of 2003. On a GAAP basis, net income grew 400 percent from the $25 million or $0.05 per share reported for the first quarter of 2003. First quarter 2003 GAAP results included a $62 million adjustment, or $0.13 per share, for the application of EITF 02-16. "Our associates delivered another terrific quarter, with all segments of the business exceeding expectations," said Ron Sargent, president and CEO. "We're gaining market share and differentiating our company as a result of our focus on customer satisfaction and execution." Highlights of Staples' performance for the first quarter include: -- Customer service improvements resulted in the highest retail Mystery Shop and delivery Perfect Order scores in the company's history. -- North American Retail grew sales 10 percent and operating profit 40 percent. -- North American Delivery benefited from investments made in 2003, growing sales 11 percent and operating profit 24 percent. -- Europe grew sales 20 percent and achieved significant improvement in profitability in both the retail and delivery businesses. Operating profit rose 137 percent. -- The company generated $128 million in free cash flow. "Delivering on our promise to make buying office products easy for our customers, coupled with executing our strategy to drive return on net assets, remain Staples' recipe for achieving superior performance and differentiation," said Sargent. Outlook For the second quarter of 2004, Staples expects to achieve 20 percent earnings per share growth, consistent with current consensus. Second quarter revenues are expected to increase in the high single-digits, with North American Retail comparable sales in the low single-digits. As a result of achieving earnings per share of $0.03 above expectations in the first quarter, we now expect to deliver more than 20 percent earnings growth for the full year. The company will continue to invest in profitable growth for the future and is comfortable with the existing analyst consensus for earnings per share for the remainder of the year.
