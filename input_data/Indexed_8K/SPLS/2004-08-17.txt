Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Second Quarter 2004 Performance; Sales Increased Nine Percent and Earnings Per Share Rose 33 Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2004-- North American Retail Comps Increased Four Percent; Company Announces Entry into China and Two European Delivery Acquisitions Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its second quarter ended July 31, 2004. Total company revenues increased nine percent to $3.09 billion, compared to $2.83 billion for the second quarter of 2003. Net income rose 39 percent to $122 million, and earnings per share, on a diluted basis, increased 33 percent to $0.24, from $0.18 achieved in the second quarter of 2003. Financial highlights for the second quarter include: -- North American Retail sales were $1.70 billion, up seven percent, and operating income grew 44 percent to $96 million, compared to the second quarter of 2003. Same store comparable sales rose an industry leading four percent for the quarter, with strong performance in core office supplies, technology and furniture. -- North American Delivery sales increased 11 percent to $980 million and operating income rose 22 percent to $88 million, compared to the second quarter of 2003. -- Sales in Europe grew 15 percent versus the second quarter of 2003 to $409 million, or seven percent in local currencies, with operating income up 143 percent to $12 million. -- Inventory turns increased 34 basis points to 5.39 times as the company continues to benefit from its Summit supply chain program. -- The company generated $130 million in free cash flow in the first half of 2004. "Our operating performance and strong cash flow have allowed us to invest in our core business and have given us the flexibility and resources to invest in new profitable growth ideas that will drive our business several years down the road," said Ron Sargent, president and CEO. "Our 60,000 associates worldwide continue to focus on execution and delivering great results by making it easy for our customers every day." Staples plans to enter the $25 billion Chinese office products market and to add two acquisitions to its European delivery operations. Staples' joint venture with OA365, a Chinese internet and catalog delivery business, will provide Staples with an attractive platform to address the fastest growing market in the world, and the opportunity to increase its investment over time. The acquisitions of Pressel Versand International GmbH, based in Vienna, Austria, and the office products division of Malling Beck A/S of Denmark, would expand Staples European Catalog's operations into Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and complement existing operations in Germany, France, and Belgium. These two acquisitions, upon closing, are expected to add annual profitable sales of approximately 25 million Euros and expand Staples European Catalog's operations to 15 countries. "With our first foray into China and eastern Europe, we will establish a stronger presence in the global office products market, while continuing to stay focused on our initiatives to drive growth and improve return on net assets. The associates from OA365, Pressel, and Malling Beck will be a great addition to the Staples family," said Sargent. "By focusing on execution and innovation, we are well positioned to maintain our industry leadership." Outlook For the third quarter of 2004, Staples expects to achieve 20 percent earnings growth, in line with average analyst estimates. Staples expects to achieve high single digit sales growth for the total company. For North American Retail, Staples expects a low single digit comparable sales increase. As a result of achieving earnings per share above expectations in the second quarter, Staples now expects to achieve approximately 24 percent earnings growth for the full year. The company now anticipates generating free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the full year.
