Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Third Quarter Earnings; Earnings Per Share Increased 24 Percent and North American Retail Comparable Sales Rose Four Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 16, 2004--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq:SPLS) announced today the results for its third quarter ended October 30, 2004. The company achieved net income of $209 million for the quarter, a 26 percent increase versus the third quarter of 2003. Earnings per share of $0.41, on a diluted basis, rose 24 percent compared to last year's third quarter. The company reported total sales for the quarter of $3.8 billion, an increase of 12 percent versus $3.4 billion reported for the same quarter in the prior year. North American Retail comparable sales increased four percent, driven by increased customer traffic, strong performance in furniture, office supplies and copy center, and a solid Back to School season. North American Delivery sales grew 13 percent, as continued marketing and sales force investments accelerated customer acquisition. European sales rose 24 percent or 15 percent in local currencies. "Staples' customers are responding positively to our strong execution and easy shopping experience, resulting in rapid market share gains," said Ron Sargent, Staples' president and chief executive officer. "Our team remains focused on improving customer service, differentiating our brand and investing in profitable growth to expand our market leadership." Third quarter highlights include: -- Total company operating margin improved 90 basis points year over year to 8.7 percent. -- North American Retail operating income improved 37 percent compared to the third quarter of 2003, benefiting from strong execution and expense control as well as continued strength in higher margin areas, including copy center and Staples brand products. -- North American Delivery operating income improved 15 percent compared to the third quarter of 2003, driven by record account acquisition and retention. -- The company generated $631 million in free cash flow year to date. -- Inventory turns improved by 34 basis points year over year to 5.49 times. -- The previously announced European delivery acquisitions, Pressel and Malling Beck, the acquisition of 59 Office World retail stores in the United Kingdom, and our Chinese joint venture, OA365(China), closed during the quarter, increasing Staples' presence to 19 countries. Outlook For the fourth quarter ending January 29, 2005, the company expects to achieve earnings per share of $0.50. Staples anticipates low double-digit sales growth for the total company and low single-digit North American Retail comparable sales. In our North American Delivery business, the company expects low to mid-teens growth, and in our European business, sales growth in the high teens is expected.
