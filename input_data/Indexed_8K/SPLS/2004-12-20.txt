Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 14, 2004, Staples, Inc. ("Staples") as Borrower entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement ("Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A and the other lending institutions listed in the Agreement, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citicorp USA, Inc., as Syndication Agent, and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Co-Documentation Agents.  Bank of America Securities LLC acted as sole Lead Arranger and sole Book Manager under the Agreement.
 
The Agreement replaces a revolving credit facility entered into on June 21, 2002, by and among Staples, the lending institutions party thereto and Fleet National Bank as administrative agent which was due to expire in June 2006 (the "Prior Agreement").  The Prior Agreement was terminated on December 14, 2004, at which time there were no borrowings outstanding thereunder.  Letters of credit issued under the Prior Agreement, which totaled approximately $62,400,000 as of December 14, 2004, were transferred to the Agreement.
 
The Agreement provides for a maximum borrowing of $750,000,000 and terminates on December 14, 2009.  This maximum borrowing amount may be reduced from time to time according to the terms of the Agreement.  Borrowings made pursuant to the Agreement may be syndicated loans, competitive bid loans, or swing line loans, the combined sum of which may not exceed the maximum borrowing amount.  Amounts borrowed under the Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until December 14, 2009.
 
Borrowings made pursuant to the Agreement as syndicated loans will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at either (a) the base rate, described in the Agreement as the higher of the annual rate of the lead bank's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (b) the Eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate) plus a percentage spread based on Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio. Borrowings made as competitive bid loans bear the competitive bid rate as specified in the applicable competitive bid.  Swing line loans bear interest that is the lesser of the base rate or the swing line rate as quoted by the Administrative Agent under the terms of the Agreement.  Under the Agreement, Staples agrees to pay a facility fee, payable quarterly, at rates that range from 0.090% to 0.250% depending on Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio, and when applicable, a utilization fee.  The payments under this Agreement are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries of Staples that guarantee Staples' publicly issued notes.
 
The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on Staples and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, sale-leaseback transactions, subordinated debt, and transactions with affiliates.  The covenants permit Staples to use proceeds of the credit loans and letters of credit for the repayment of all amounts under the Prior Agreement and for other existing indebtedness, as permitted under the Agreement, for working capital and capital expenditures and for all other lawful corporate purposes, including payment of dividends, acquisitions of assets, capital stock of other companies and share repurchases, in each case to the extent permitted in the Agreement.  The covenants require that in the event a Staples' subsidiary that is not currently a guarantor under the Agreement becomes a guarantor of any of Staples' publicly issued notes or bonds, Staples shall cause such subsidiary to become a guarantor under the Agreement.  The Agreement also contains financial covenants that require Staples to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 and a maximum adjusted funded debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.75.
 
 
The Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by Staples proving to be false in any material respect, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting Staples or its subsidiaries, defaults relating to other indebtedness of at least $50,000,000 in the aggregate, a change in control of Staples (as defined in the Agreement), and failure to meet the requirement that Staples and its guarantor subsidiaries shall collectively have at least $355,000,000 of consolidated EBT (as defined in the Agreement).
 
In the event of a default by Staples, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders shall, declare all obligations under the Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the Agreement, and enforce any and all rights of the Lenders or Administrative Agent under the Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of Staples will become immediately due and payable.
 
Certain of the Lenders party to the Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for Staples and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Effective December 14, 2004, the revolving credit facility by and among Staples, the lending institutions party thereto and Fleet National Bank as administrative agent (the "Prior Agreement"), which provided for a maximum borrowing of $600,000,000 and was due to expire in June 2006, was terminated. Borrowings made pursuant to the Prior Agreement bore interest at the lower of (a) the higher of the lead bank's prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the Eurodollar rate plus a percentage spread based upon Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio, or (c) a competitive bid rate.  The Prior Agreement contained financial covenants that required Staples to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 and a maximum adjusted funded debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.75 and an affirmative covenant that required Staples to maintain at least $275,000,000 of consolidated EBIT (as defined in the Prior Agreement) for Staples and its subsidiaries that guaranteed the Prior Agreement.  As of December 14, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding under the Prior Agreement and approximately $62,400,000 of letters of credit were issued thereunder.  These letters of credit were transferred to the Agreement, a description of which is contained under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.  Staples did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Agreement.

If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Credit Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; that if any Eurocurrency Rate Loan in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

2.4.2.   
Advances by Administrative Agent
 
(a)           The Administrative Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by any Lender prior to a Drawdown Date, assume that such Lender has made available to the Administrative Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Syndicated Loans (or, in the case of Competitive Bid Loans, the amount of such Lender's accepted offers of Competitive Bid Loans, if any) to be made on such Drawdown Date, and the Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (a) the average computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of the Overnight Rate for each day included in such period, times (b) the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Syndicated Loans (or accepted offers of Competitive Bid Loans, as applicable), times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Drawdown Date to the date on which the amount of such Lender's Syndicated Loans or Competitive Bid Loans, as applicable, shall become immediately available to the Administrative Agent, and the denominator of which is 360.  A statement of the Administrative Agent submitted to such Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this 2.4.2 shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing to the Administrative Agent by such Lender.  If the amount of such Lender's Syndicated Loans or Competitive Bid Loans, as applicable, is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days following such Drawdown Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from the Borrower on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Syndicated Loans or Competitive Bid Loans, as applicable, made on such Drawdown Date and the Borrower may take the actions permitted under 4.12 hereof to replace such Lender.  Any payment by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent of any Syndicated Loans or Competitive Bid Loans pursuant to this 2.4.2 shall be deemed to be a payment of the Revolving Credit Loans that were to be made by the Lender that failed to make such Syndicated Loans or Competitive Bid Loans, as applicable.
(b)           Unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to such Lender.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in Same Day Funds, then each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.
 
(c)           A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under 2.4.2(a) and (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent to reduce by $5,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof or terminate entirely the Total Commitment, whereupon the Commitment Amount of each Lender shall be reduced pro rata in accordance with its Commitment Percentage by the amount specified in such notice or, as the case may be, terminated.  Promptly after receiving any notice of the Borrower delivered pursuant to this 2.5, the Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of the substance thereof.  Upon the effective date of any such reduction or termination, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders the full amount of the Facility Fee then accrued on the amount of the reduction.  No reduction or termination of the Total Commitment may be reinstated.

(b)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans plus (ii) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans plus (iii) the Maximum Drawing Amount plus (iv) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations is equal to or exceeds an amount equal to 102% of the Total Commitment, then the Borrower shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iv) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the
Total Commitment then in effect, such payment to be applied to the Revolving Credit Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(c)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans plus (ii) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans plus (iii) the Maximum Drawing Amount plus (iv) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds an amount equal to 100% of the Total Commitment, but is less than 102%, then the Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iv) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Total Commitment then in effect, such payment to be applied to the Revolving Credit Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(d)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Syndicated Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (ii) the Maximum Drawing Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (iii) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies exceeds an amount equal to 102% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit, then the Borrower shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iii) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, such payment to be applied to such Syndicated Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(e)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Syndicated Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (ii) the Maximum Drawing Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (iii) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies exceeds an amount equal to 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit, but is less than 102%, then the Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iii) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, such payment to be applied to such Syndicated Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(f)            So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated among the Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as practicable to the respective unpaid principal amount of the Syndicated Loans made by each Lender, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior payments or repayments not exactly in proportion, and if no
Syndicated Loans are outstanding, to the Competitive Bid Loans, in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the unpaid principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loans made by each Lender.
 
.  The Borrower shall have the right, at its election, to repay the outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, as a whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium, provided that any full or partial repayment of the outstanding amount of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Competitive Bid Loan pursuant to this 2.7 may be made only on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto unless the Borrower pays each Lender, or, in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan, the applicable Lender, in accordance with 4.10, the costs and expenses incurred by such Lender as a result of the repayment of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or, as the case may be, Competitive Bid Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent, prior written notice no later than 1:00 p.m., (New York time), on the date of any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Base Rate Loans, no later than 1:00 p.m., (New York time), three (3) Business Days' prior to any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars and Competitive Bid Loans, and no later than 1:00 p.m., (New York time), four (4) Business Days' (or five (5), in the case of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Special Notice Currencies) prior to any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each case specifying the proposed date of repayment of such Revolving Credit Loans and, the principal amount to be repaid.  Each such partial repayment of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and shall be applied, in the case of Syndicated Loans, in the absence of instruction by the Borrower, first to the principal of Base Rate Loans and then to the principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and, in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan, to such Competitive Bid Loan.  Each partial repayment of Syndicated Loans shall be allocated among the Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amount of the Syndicated Loans made by each Lender being repaid, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior repayments not exactly in proportion.
