Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Fiscal 2004 and Fourth Quarter Results; North American Retail Comparable Sales Rose Four Percent for the Fiscal Year and Fourth Quarter FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 24, 2005-- Net Income Rose 19 Percent and Revenues Increased 13 Percent in the Fourth Quarter Company to Increase Annual Cash Dividend and Declare Three-For-Two Stock Dividend Staples, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLS) announced today the results for its fiscal year and fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005. For fiscal year 2004, sales reached $14.4 billion, an 11 percent increase compared to 2003. Full year North American Retail comparable store sales increased four percent. The company reported 2004 net income of $708 million, or earnings per share on a diluted basis of $1.40, an increase of 41 percent on a GAAP basis from 2003. The company incurred a $62 million non-cash adjustment (net of taxes) as a result of the application of EITF 02-16 in the first quarter of 2003. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of EITF 02-16, net income increased 28 percent and earnings per share increased 25 percent versus 2003. Total company operating margins for the year rose to 7.8 percent. Total company sales for the fourth quarter grew 13 percent compared to the same quarter of 2003 to $4.1 billion. North American Retail continued its strong performance, with sales increasing eight percent and same store sales rising four percent versus last year. North American Delivery quarterly sales increased 19 percent with double-digit growth in each of its three business units. International operations grew sales 22 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Total company net income of $251 million, or earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.50, rose 19 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. The company also announced that its board of directors has approved an annual cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on April 14, 2005, to shareholders of record on March 28, 2005. This represents a 25 percent increase over the dividend of $0.20 per share paid in 2004. The board also authorized a three-for-two stock dividend effective to shareholders of record on March 29, 2005, with a payment date of April 15, 2005. "Our 65,000 associates had a great year in 2004, delivering strong results, differentiating Staples' brand and advancing our market leadership around the world," said Ron Sargent, Staples' president and CEO. Key company accomplishments for the year and fourth quarter: -- The company made significant progress delivering on Staples' brand promise, "we make buying office products easy," resulting in improved customer service across all business units. The company launched a new advertising campaign featuring the "easy button" concept, designed to make the association between "easy" and Staples concrete in customers' minds. -- Staples' own brand products exceeded 15 percent of sales for the year. -- The company generated $844 million in free cash flow in 2004 and ended the year with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. -- Inventory turns improved by 40 basis points year over year to 5.6 times, continuing progress from the company's Summit supply chain program. -- North American Retail drove 30 percent improvement in business unit income for 2004, supported by the company's Copy Center initiative, improved customer service and strong execution in key categories. -- North American Delivery grew sales 13 percent and business unit income 22 percent for the full year, successfully implementing strategies to acquire new customers and increase retention. -- Worldwide e-commerce sales reached $3 billion for the year, a 25 percent increase versus 2003. -- During the fourth quarter, the company acquired Officenet, an office products delivery business serving Argentina and Brazil, extending Staples' global presence to 21 countries. "We're starting off 2005 on rock solid footing," said Sargent. "Trends are strong, our team's execution has never been better and we are driving improvements in all areas of our business." Outlook For the full year 2005, the company anticipates revenue growth to be in the low double-digit range, with low single-digit North American Retail comparable sales. North American Delivery sales are expected to increase in the low double-digit range, and International revenues are expected to grow in the mid-teens. Earnings per share are expected to grow in the range of 15 to 18 percent. For the first quarter ending April 30, 2005, the company expects to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.29 to $0.30. The company anticipates low double-digit sales growth for the total company and high single-digit growth in the North American Retail business, with low single-digit comparable sales. For the North American Delivery business, the company expects sales growth in the low to mid-teens. In the International businesses, sales growth in the mid-teens is expected. This outlook does not include any impact relating to the expensing of stock options under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's statement 123R, which is effective for quarters beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on the company's growth assumptions after adjusting 2004 results for the impact of stock option expensing.
