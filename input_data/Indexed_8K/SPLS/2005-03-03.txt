This agreement will be used to evidence grants of performance shares made under the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan to the Company's officers.  The full text of the form of agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, such exhibit.

If the conditions described below are satisfied, such award will be made under the terms of the Staples 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Plan"), on the Vesting Date.
 
 
By your acceptance of this Performance Share Award Agreement, you agree that any Shares will be awarded under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and by the terms and conditions of the Staples Performance Share Award Agreement  Terms and Conditions ("PSA20__"), which is attached hereto (this Performance Share Award Agreement and the PSA20__ are together referred to as the "Agreement").
 
Performance Criteria: The following Performance Criteria must be satisfied for an award of Shares to be made under this Agreement.  As more fully described in PSA20__, the number of Shares awarded on the Vesting Date shall be determined based on the extent to which the FY 20__ - FY 20__ Cumulative RONA Dollars are achieved.  All awards of Shares require certification of the Staples Board of Directors that the Performance Criteria have been satisfied.
 
 
* Cumulative
RONA Dollars are in millions.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cumulative RONA Dollars" means the cumulative profit generated across the Staples business units in excess of the capital employed during the Performance Period calculated in a manner consistent with the method used by Staples for financial planning purposes; provided that such term specifically excludes Corporate Contingency and any cash held at the Staples, Inc. level.
 
You understand and agree that this Agreement is being awarded to you in exchange for your execution of a Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreement in a form approved by Staples.

.  If all the conditions set forth in this Agreement are satisfied, on the Vesting Date an award of Shares will be made under the Plan to the Recipient named in the accompanying Performance Share Award Agreement.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Staples" shall include any parent and all present and future subsidiaries of Staples as defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or replaced from time to time (the "Code").

The Performance Criteria set forth in the accompanying Performance Share Award Agreement are satisfied during the Performance Period.  The Staples Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, must determine and certify on the date of its first regularly scheduled meeting in FY 20__ (generally in March) whether, and to what extent, the Performance Criteria have been achieved.  The date on which the Board of Directors certifies that the Performance Criteria have been satisfied shall be the "Vesting Date" for purposes of this Agreement.  In making its determination, the Compensation Committee may adjust the Performance Criteria to take into account accounting changes, acquisitions and related charges, and other special one-time or extraordinary gains and/or losses and other one-time or extraordinary events as permitted under the Plan; provided that the Compensation Committee may not adjust the Performance Criteria to take into account foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in corporate tax rates or recurring store closures consistent with historic patterns (with widespread, out of the ordinary store closures not being consistent with historic patterns).  Awards of Shares shall be made only at the percentages set forth in the Performance Share Award Agreement under the heading "% Target Shares Earned"; there will be no pro-rata issuances of Shares for achievement of other FY 20__  FY 20__ Cumulative RONA Dollar amounts.  If the minimum Threshold FY 20__  FY 20__ Cumulative RONA Dollars is not achieved during the Performance Period, no Shares will be issued and this Agreement will be of no force or effect.

(D) Failure by the Recipient to devote his or her full working time to the affairs of Staples except as may be authorized in writing by Staples' CEO or other authorized Company official; or
 
(E) The Recipient's engagement in business other than the business of Staples except as may be authorized in writing by Staples' CEO or other authorized Company official; or
