Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record First Quarter Performance; Sales Increased 13 Percent and Earnings Per Share Rose 24 Percent; North American Retail Comparable Sales Increased Four Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2005--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its first quarter ended April 30, 2005. Total company sales for the quarter grew to $3.90 billion, an increase of 13 percent versus $3.45 billion for the same quarter of 2004. North American Retail comparable sales increased four percent, with total North American Retail sales growth of nine percent. North American Delivery sales rose 17 percent, and International sales grew 19 percent. The company achieved net income of $159 million for the quarter. After adjusting for the three-for-two stock split effective April 15, 2005, this represents earnings per share of $0.21, on a diluted basis, a 24 percent increase over the first quarter of 2004. "Our team continues to deliver industry-leading results and drive significant market share gains," said Ron Sargent, Staples' chairman and chief executive officer. "We are reaping the rewards of our balanced approach to growth and profitability. The continued strength of our North American businesses provides us with the flexibility to invest in the many ideas that will sustain our growth in the years to come." Highlights of Staples' performance for the first quarter include: -- North American Retail achieved 40 percent improvement in business unit income, driven by gross profit expansion and operating expense management. -- North American Delivery increased business unit income 35 percent and now ranks number one in sales in the delivered office products market. -- The company opened eight stores in Chicago, with sales exceeding expectations. -- International comparable retail sales were flat, with positive retail comps in Germany, Belgium and Portugal. -- The company converted 22 Office World stores with plans to complete 25 additional remodels by August. -- Total company operating margin improved 60 basis points year over year to 6.4 percent, reflecting the company's continued focus on customer service, execution and differentiation. -- Inventory turns improved by 33 basis points year over year to 5.65 times. -- The company paid an annual cash dividend of $0.17 per share (or $0.25 on a pre-split basis) on April 14, 2005, to shareholders of record on March 28, 2005. -- Staples issued a three-for-two common stock dividend on April 15, 2005, to shareholders of record on March 29, 2005. Outlook For the second quarter of 2005, Staples expects to achieve 18 percent earnings per share growth, consistent with current analyst estimates. Second quarter revenues are expected to increase in the low double-digits, with North American Retail comparable sales in the low single-digits. North American Delivery growth is expected to be in the mid-teens, and the company's International business is expected to have growth in the high-teens. For the full-year 2005, the company anticipates revenue growth to be in the low double-digit range, with low single-digit North American Retail comparable sales. North American Delivery sales are expected to increase in the low to mid-teens range, and the International business is expected to have growth in the mid to high-teens. The company is comfortable with the current average analyst earnings estimates for the remainder of the year and expects full-year earnings per share growth to fall in the high end of the previously articulated range of 15 to 18 percent. This outlook does not include any impact related to the expensing of stock options, which the company does not expect to implement until the first quarter of 2006.
