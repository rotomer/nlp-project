Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Second Quarter Performance; Revenues Increased 12 Percent and Earnings Per Share Rose 25 Percent; Net Income Increased 20 Percent; North American Retail Comparable Sales Rose Three Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 16, 2005--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its second quarter ended July 30, 2005. Total company revenues increased 12 percent to $3.47 billion, compared to $3.09 billion for the second quarter of 2004. Compared to last year's second quarter, net income rose 20 percent to $147 million, and earnings per share rose 25 percent to $0.20, on a diluted basis. Second quarter North American Retail comparable sales increased three percent year over year, with total North American Retail sales growth of nine percent. North American Delivery sales grew 17 percent, with double digit growth in all three businesses. International sales rose 15 percent or two percent excluding benefits from foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. "Our team delivered another strong quarter of profitable growth through our commitment to making it easy for our customers," said Ron Sargent, Staples' chairman and chief executive officer. "We continue to drive sustainable market share gains through consistent execution and focus on our growth initiatives." Highlights for the second quarter include: -- Total company operating income improved 34 basis points year over year to 6.7 percent. -- Operating income in the company's North American businesses increased significantly, up 160 basis points to 7.2 percent in Retail and up 70 basis points to 9.7 percent in Delivery. -- Inventory turns increased 22 basis points to 5.61 times, reflecting continued improvement in supply chain performance from the Summit program. -- Staples opened an additional seven stores in Chicago, bringing the total number of stores to 15. The Chicago market launch continues to exceed expectations. -- North American Delivery has benefited from the Chicago retail market entry, particularly Staples Business Delivery which has nearly doubled its sales in this market since the company's retail launch. To support significant growth in the Midwest, the company will be opening a new fulfillment center near Chicago next year. -- The company has developed four innovative products, under the Staples brand, from the 2004 Invention Quest contest. These products, including the winner, the WordLock, were brought to market in time for the back to school selling season. -- The company launched Staples.com 5.0, its redesigned web-site, which offers a host of "easy" improvements based on extensive customer research. -- Staples converted 12 Office World stores in the UK to the Staples format during the quarter, and will have remodeled all 46 Office World stores by the end of August. -- Staples opened 14 new stores and closed one store in the US and opened seven stores in Canada. In Europe, Staples opened two new stores in Portugal and closed one store in the UK. The company now operates 1,716 stores worldwide. -- The company generated $127 million in free cash flow in the first half of 2005. Outlook For the third quarter of 2005, Staples expects to achieve earnings per share growth in line with average analyst estimates. Staples expects to achieve low double digit sales growth for the total company. For North American Retail, the company expects a low single digit comparable sales increase. In the North American Delivery business, the company expects sales growth in the mid-teens, and for the International business, Staples expects low single digit sales growth. For the full year 2005, Staples expects revenues to grow in the low double digits, with low single digit North American Retail comparable sales. North American Retail sales are expected to increase in the high single digits, North American Delivery revenue growth is expected to be in mid-teens range, and the International business is expected to have mid to high single digit sales growth. The company is comfortable with the current average analyst earnings estimates for the remainder of the year and expects the earnings per share growth rate for the full year to be in the high teens. In addition, Staples expects free cash flow generation of approximately $750 million.
