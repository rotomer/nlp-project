Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Third Quarter Performance; Company Sales Increased 11 Percent; Earnings Per Share Rose 14 Percent; North American Retail Comparable Sales Increased Three Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2005--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its third quarter ended October 29, 2005. Total company sales grew to $4.25 billion, an increase of 11 percent versus $3.83 billion for the same quarter of the prior year. Net income rose 14 percent year-over-year to $238 million, and earnings per share, on a diluted basis, increased 14 percent to $0.32, from the $0.28 achieved in the third quarter of 2004. "Our associates once again drove industry leading sales and profits," said Ron Sargent, Staples' chairman and chief executive officer. "Our commitment to make it easy for our customers continues to fuel market share gains." Highlights for the third quarter include: -- North American Retail sales were $2.45 billion, up nine percent. Same store comparable sales increased three percent year-over-year, with strong performance in copy center, networking, digital cameras and accessories, portable computers, and peripherals. -- North American Delivery increased revenues by 18 percent to $1.29 billion. -- Sales in the company's International business rose four percent, or five percent in local currency, but declined two percent excluding benefits from acquisitions and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. -- Total company operating income increased 16 basis points to 8.8 percent of sales, with North American Retail and North American Delivery both achieving record third quarter performance with operating income rising to 10 percent of sales. -- Inventory turns increased 17 basis points to 5.66 times. -- Staples opened 18 new stores in the US and 11 stores in Canada. In Europe, Staples added a total of three new stores with one opening in the UK, the Netherlands and Portugal. The company now operates 1,748 stores worldwide. -- The company generated $465 million in free cash flow during the first three quarters of the year. Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2005, Staples expects to achieve earnings per share growth in line with average analyst estimates. Staples expects to achieve approximately 10 percent sales growth for the total company. For North American Retail, the company expects a low single digit comparable sales increase. In the North American Delivery business, the company expects sales growth in the mid teens, and for the International business, Staples expects flat sales performance. Looking ahead to 2006, Staples expects revenues to grow in the low double digits, and expects to achieve earnings per share growth in the range of 15 to 20 percent, including a 53rd week in fiscal 2006 and the adjustment for stock option expense in 2005 and 2006. The company will expense stock options beginning in the first quarter of 2006, and restate earnings for 2005 to reflect the impact of stock option expense, which is expected to reduce 2005 earnings per share by $0.06 to $0.07, on a diluted basis. Stock option expense is expected to impact earnings per share by $0.07 to $0.08, on a diluted basis, in 2006. As a result of expensing stock options, earnings per share for 2006 are expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.26, on a diluted basis.
