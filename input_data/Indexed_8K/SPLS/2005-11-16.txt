Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
  We have previously disclosed that class action lawsuits have been brought against Staples, Inc. for alleged violations of what is known as California's "wage and hour" law.  On November 15, 2005, after filing our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 29, 2005, we were informed that the court has granted class certification to the plaintiffs.  The court's ruling is procedural only and does not address the merits of the plaintiffs' allegations.  We believe that the class was improperly certified and intend to appeal the decision.  If the case goes to trial, we believe we have meritorious defenses in the litigation and expect to prevail.  If, however, there is an adverse judgment from which there is no successful appeal, damages could range from $10 million to $150 million, excluding interest and attorneys' fees.
California wage and hour class action lawsuit.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
