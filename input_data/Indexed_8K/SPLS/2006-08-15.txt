Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Second Quarter Performance; Earnings Per Share Increased 22 Percent and Sales Rose 12 Percent; North American Retail Comparable Sales Increased Four Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2006--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its second quarter ended July 29, 2006. The company posted record sales and earnings, driven by market share gains in North America and steady progress in its International business. Total company sales rose 12 percent to $3.88 billion compared to the $3.47 billion reported for the second quarter of 2005. Net income increased 19 percent year-over-year to $161 million, and earnings per share, on a diluted basis, increased 22 percent to $0.22, from the $0.18 achieved in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter North American Retail comparable store sales increased four percent versus 2005, reflecting positive customer traffic. North American Retail continued to see strength in categories like mobile computing and accessories, core office supplies, copy and print, ink and toner, and improved performance in the furniture category. Total North American Retail sales rose 10 percent and North American Delivery grew sales 17 percent versus last year. International sales rose five percent in local currency and eight percent in US dollars, with one percent comparable store sales growth in European Retail. "Thanks to our associates' focus on execution and commitment to service, we continue to win with customers and gain market share," said Ron Sargent, Staples' chairman and chief executive officer. "With strong traffic in North American Retail, continued momentum in North American Delivery, and steady progress in International, 2006 is on track to be another great year." Highlights for the second quarter include: -- Top-line growth accelerated as the company benefited from recent investments in key growth platforms, such as its copy and print center, contract sales force, web platforms, and expansion into new geographies. -- Total company operating margin improved 30 basis points to 6.5 percent, a record second quarter performance. -- Customer service metrics continue to improve, reaching all time highs in both retail and delivery in North America. -- The company is on track to reach its goal of 20 percent of sales from Staples brand products. During the quarter, Staples launched over 200 new own brand products in time for Back-to-School. -- Staples opened two new multi-channel fulfillment centers, in Atlanta and Orlando, to support the rapid growth in North American Delivery. -- Gross profit margin increased in North American Retail, but overall gross profit margin decreased 24 basis points, primarily due to costs associated with new fulfillment centers, fuel, and paper in North American Delivery. -- Inventory turns increased 16 basis points to 5.77 times, as the company continues to focus on its supply chain improvement programs in both retail and delivery. -- Staples opened 11 new stores and closed one store in the United States, opened two stores in Canada, two stores in Portugal, and one store in Germany. The company now operates 1,801 stores worldwide. Outlook For the third quarter of 2006, Staples anticipates low double-digit sales growth for the total company and expects earnings per share to grow 15 to 20 percent, in line with average analyst estimates. For the full year, the company expects to achieve the high end of the range of its previously stated earnings guidance of 15 to 20 percent growth. Staples expects free cash flow generation in the range of $700 million this year. Earnings growth expectations for the third quarter and full year 2006 refer to 2005 earnings restated to include the impact of stock compensation expense under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's statement 123R, which the company implemented as of January 29, 2006. Pro forma restated financial statements are available on the "Financial Measures" section of the investor relations website on www.staples.com. The company's earnings outlook also reflects the impact of a 53rd week in fiscal 2006. Today's Conference Call The company will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. (ET) to review these results and its outlook. Investors may listen to the call at http://investor.staples.com.
