Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports Record Third Quarter Results; Earnings Per Share Increased 30 Percent North American Retail Comparable Sales Rose Four Percent European Retail Comparable Sales Increased Five Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2006--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its third quarter ended October 28, 2006. The company drove strong performance in each of its three businesses, gaining market share and winning with customers around the world. Total company sales for the third quarter 2006 increased 12 percent to $4.8 billion compared to the $4.2 billion reported for the third quarter of 2005. Net income rose 29 percent year-over-year to $290 million, and earnings per share, on a diluted basis, increased 30 percent to $0.39, from the $0.30 achieved in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter 2006 earnings results reflect a lower tax rate, due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, and a correction for prior years' stock-based compensation. Excluding these items, net income grew 18 percent to $265 million and earnings per share, on a diluted basis, were $0.36, a 20 percent increase versus third quarter 2005. Third quarter North American Retail comparable store sales increased four percent versus 2005, reflecting an excellent back-to-school season, strong traffic, and higher average order size. Total North American Retail sales rose nine percent and North American Delivery grew sales 16 percent versus last year. International sales rose 10 percent in local currency and 15 percent in US dollars, with five percent comparable store sales growth in European Retail. "The Staples team delivered another strong quarter of results," said Ron Sargent, Staples' chairman and chief executive officer. "While we continue to improve margins, we're focused on driving profitable growth, and we're pleased to see top line momentum in every part of our business." Highlights for the third quarter include: -- North American Retail continued to see strength in core office supplies, laptops, copy and print services, ink, and Staples brand products. Operating margins in this segment improved 50 basis points to 10.8 percent. -- North American Delivery operating margins improved 40 basis points to 10.8 percent, despite costs associated with opening three new fulfillment centers in Orlando, Atlanta, and Chicago this year. -- Worldwide e-commerce sales grew 27 percent to $1.2 billion. -- International operating margins improved 130 basis points to 1.5 percent, reflecting leverage on stronger sales and improving trends in Europe, particularly in the UK retail and French catalog businesses. Asian and South American businesses continue to grow rapidly. -- Total company operating margin improved 13 basis points to 8.46 percent. -- Inventory turns increased 13 basis points to 5.79 times, as the company continues to focus on its supply chain improvement programs in both retail and delivery. -- Year-to-date, the company has delivered $277 million in free cash flow after $352 million in capital expenditures. -- Staples opened 31 new stores in the United States and opened 6 stores in Canada. The company now operates 1,838 stores worldwide. Q4 & FY2006 Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2006, Staples will benefit from an extra week in the quarter. As a result, the company expects high-teens growth for the total company and earnings per share growth slightly higher than 20 percent. The company expects a positive low single-digit comparable sales increase in its North American Retail business. Same store sales are calculated on a 13 week basis. For the full year, the company expects to exceed its previously announced earnings guidance of 15 to 20 percent growth, excluding the third quarter tax benefit and the correction for prior years' stock-based compensation. Staples expects low double-digit growth for the total company on the top line and a positive, low single-digit comparable sales increase in North American Retail. Staples expects free cash flow generation of about $700 million this year. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 refer to 2005 earnings restated to include the impact of stock compensation expense under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's statement 123R, which the company implemented as of January 29, 2006, and exclude the benefit of the resolution of tax matters and the correction for prior years' stock-based compensation. Pro forma restated financial statements and other supplemental financial information are available on the "Financial Measures" section of the investor relations website on www.staples.com. The company's earnings outlook also reflects the impact of a 53rd week in fiscal 2006. FY2007 Outlook The company's guidance for 2007 is based on comparison to 2006 performance adjusted for the 53rd week, the third quarter earnings per share impact of favorable tax events, and the correction for prior years' stock-based compensation. Excluding these items, the company expects to achieve sales growth of 10 to 15 percent and earnings growth of 15 to 20 percent for the full year 2007, equating to a range of $1.43 to $1.49 of GAAP earnings per share. Staples expects a positive, low single-digit comparable sales increase in North American Retail. After adjusting for the additional week in 2006, the company expects to grow North American Delivery revenues in the mid-teens, and in International, Staples expects low double-digit growth in local currency. Q3 2006 Tax Rate Benefit The effective tax rate was 28.1 percent for the third quarter of 2006 and 32.6 percent for year-to-date 2006, compared to 36.5 percent for the third quarter and year-to-date 2005. This increased diluted EPS by $0.04 per share. The company's effective tax rate applicable to results from continuing operations is 36.0 percent. Q3 2006 Stock Based Compensation Correction During the third quarter of 2006, the company and its Audit Committee, assisted by outside counsel, conducted a review of the company's historical stock option granting practices during the period from 1997 to the present. Based on the results of the review, the company has recorded a $10.8 million expense ($8.6 million net of taxes) in the third quarter to reflect the cumulative impact of accounting errors due to the use of incorrect measurement dates, without restating any historical financial statements. The Company has concluded that the use of incorrect measurement dates was not the result of intentional wrongdoing and has taken steps to improve the controls over its option granting processes. Presentation of Non-GAAP Information This press release presents net income and earnings per share results both with and without the tax rate benefit and stock based compensation correction described above. The presentation of results that exclude these two items are non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for, the presentation of results determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below under the heading "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide a more meaningful comparison of the company's year-over-year performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's core operating results against plan, to compare the company's performance to that of its competitors, and to provide earnings guidance to the investing community. Today's Conference Call The company will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. (ET) to review these results and its outlook. Investors may listen to the call at http://investor.staples.com.
