Item 5.02.

On March 6, 2007, Brenda C. Barnes advised our Board of Directors that, due to other commitments, she will not be standing for re-election to the Board at our next annual meeting of stockholders.
On March 8, 2007, Ronald L. Sargent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, received a retention grant under our Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.  The retention grant consists of 375,000 shares of restricted stock and 375,000 shares underlying a performance share award.  The restricted shares will vest in full at the end of our 2011 fiscal year if Mr. Sargent has continuously worked for us through such date.  The restricted shares will vest in full before such date  upon Mr. Sargent's death, disability or termination without cause or if, following a change in control of Staples, Mr. Sargent is not offered employment by the surviving corporation under certain conditions or Mr. Sargent is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within one year of such change in control.  The performance shares will be awarded if we achieve certain five year cumulative sales and return on net asset goals at the end of our 2011 fiscal year.  In order to receive any performance shares, Mr. Sargent must have continuously worked for us through the end of our 2011 fiscal year unless he is terminated before such date due to his death or disability or, following a change in control of Staples, Mr. Sargent does not continue his employment with the surviving corporation or is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within one year of such change in control.  Both a minimum sales and a minimum return on net asset goal for the five year period must be met in order for any of the performance shares to be awarded, and a percentage of the total award, ranging from 50% to 100%, will be awarded based upon our sales and return on net assets exceeding such minimum goals.  The terms and conditions of Mr. Sargent's grant, including the applicable performance goals, were determined by our Compensation Committee and approved by our Board of Directors.  Mr. Sargent's grant reflects our executive compensation program's goal of linking compensation to overall company performance and is consistent with our historic practice of using long-term equity incentives to reward the achievement of long-term business objectives and to help us retain a successful and tenured management team.
