Exhibit 99.1 Staples, Inc. Reports First Quarter Performance Earnings Per Share Rose 16 Percent and Sales Increased Eight Percent FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 22, 2007--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its first quarter ended May 5, 2007. Total company sales increased eight percent to $4.6 billion compared to the first quarter of 2006. Net income rose 12 percent year over year to $209 million, and earnings per share, on a diluted basis, increased 16 percent to $0.29, from the $0.25 achieved in the first quarter of last year. First quarter North American Retail comparable sales increased one percent versus 2006, reflecting strong comps in laptop computers, peripherals, and business software coupled with continued growth in copy and print services. This growth was offset by flat performance in core office supplies and weak performance in furniture and business machines. Total North American Retail sales grew three percent. North American Delivery continued its industry-leading growth, increasing sales 15 percent versus last year's first quarter. International sales increased 16 percent in US dollars, benefiting from a $58 million foreign currency impact, and increased five percent in local currency. "We are pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter, growing earnings per share twice as fast as sales while maintaining our investments in new growth ideas," said Ron Sargent, Staples' chairman and chief executive officer. "Our North American Delivery business is benefiting from terrific top line sales momentum and our International business remains firmly on track to drive significant profit improvement. North American Retail gained market share in many categories and delivered solid operating profit margins despite softer than expected sales growth." Highlights for the first quarter include: -- Total company operating income improved 28 basis points year over year to 7.03 percent, with all three business units growing profits faster than sales. -- North American Retail operating income was 8.02 percent, up 19 basis points versus 2006, reflecting strong expense control in a softer than expected sales environment. -- North American Delivery drove strong sales growth across all major product categories, achieved excellent customer satisfaction scores, and improved supply chain metrics, driving a 17 basis point improvement in operating income to 9.53 percent. -- The company agreed to purchase American Identity, one of the largest global distributors of promotional products, expanding the range of products available to Staples' customers. -- Profits grew 47 percent in the International segment, reflecting sustained progress in the company's profit improvement efforts in Europe and continued investment in Asia and South America. -- Inventory turns rose 4 basis points to 5.84 times. -- Staples opened 24 new stores in the United States, opened three new stores in Europe (one each in Germany, Portugal and Belgium), and added 17 stores in China, including those in the recent Pei Pei acquisition. The company now operates 1,927 stores worldwide. -- The company generated $128 million in free cash flow during the first quarter of the year after $64 million in capital expenditures. -- The company repurchased 7.2 million shares of its stock for $188 million and spent $208 million to pay its annual dividend during the quarter. Outlook In view of the softer than expected sales environment in our North American Retail business during the first quarter, the company is taking a more cautious approach regarding expectations for the remainder of the year. Staples is maintaining its earnings guidance for 15 to 20 percent growth for both the second quarter and the full year, but now anticipates earnings per share growth at the low end of the range. This guidance reflects adjustments to 2006 earnings, including the 53rd week benefit, favorable tax events and prior years' stock-based compensation, and equates to a range of $1.43 to $1.49 for the fiscal year 2007. Staples anticipates double-digit sales growth for the total company and a low single digit comp for North American Retail for the second quarter. For fiscal year 2007, adjusting for the extra week in 2006, Staples anticipates double-digit sales growth for the total company and a low single digit comp for North American Retail. Today's Conference Call The company will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. (ET) to review these results and its outlook. Investors may listen to the call at http://investor.staples.com.
