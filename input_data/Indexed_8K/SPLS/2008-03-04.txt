The companys guidance for future periods excludes any potential impact relating to our previously announced proposal to acquire the ordinary shares of Corporate Express NV.
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
This press release presents sales and earnings per share results both with and without the previously reported expense related to the settlement of California wage and hour class action litigation during the third quarter of 2007, as well as the extra week and previously reported tax rate benefit and stock-based compensation correction during 2006. The presentation of results that exclude these items are non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for, the presentation of results determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below under the heading Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide a more meaningful comparison of the companys year-over-year performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the companys core operating results against plan, to compare the companys performance to that of its competitors, and to provide earnings guidance to the investing community.
