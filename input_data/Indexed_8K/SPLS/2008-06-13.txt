Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On June 9, 2008, Staples, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a commercial paper program (the "Program") on a private placement basis under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the "Notes") up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion. The Program was entered into in connection with its $3.0 billion credit agreement entered into April 1, 2008 with Bank of America, N.A. and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as co-syndication agents, and Lehman Brothers Inc., as lead arranger and bookrunner, disclosed previously on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed April 1, 2008.
 
Under the Program, the Company may issue Notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the Notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases.  Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Program not to exceed the maximum aggregate amount.
 
Lehman Brothers Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC will act as dealers under the Program (each, a "Dealer") pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective Commercial Paper Dealer Agreements with the Company, dated as of June 9, 2008 (each a "Dealer Agreement").  LaSalle Bank will act as issuing and paying agent under the Program.
 
The Program provides the terms under which the Dealers will either purchase from the Company or arrange for the sale by the Company of Notes pursuant to an exemption from federal and state securities laws.  The Program contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions.
 
The maturities of the Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.  The Notes will bear such interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at such discount from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Dealers and the Company.
 
The Program contains certain events of default including, among other things, non-payment of principal or interest and bankruptcy and insolvency events.
 
A copy of each Dealer Agreement is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and each is incorporated by reference as though it were fully set forth herein.  The description above is a summary of the Program and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Program itself, including the Dealer Agreements.
 
No direct financial obligations of the Company are outstanding under the Program as of the date hereof.
 
Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
Staples' Executive Officer Incentive Plan
. On June 9, 2008, the stockholders of the Company approved Staples' Executive Officer Incentive Plan for the fiscal years 2008 through 2012 (the "Incentive Plan"), which is similar to executive bonus plans that the Company adopted in prior years and provides for the
 
 
 
payment of annual cash bonus awards to Staples' executive officers based on the Company's performance or the performance of the Company's business units measured against specific performance objectives established for that fiscal year.
 
The Incentive Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which Committee will have broad authority to determine target bonuses, select performance objectives, adopt rules and regulations relating to the Incentive Plan, and make decisions and interpretations regarding the provisions of the Incentive Plan.  Each executive officer will have a target bonus award (a "Target Award") for each plan year. Target Awards will be expressed as a percentage of the actual base salary paid to the executive officer during that plan year. The percentages will be determined by the Compensation Committee based upon the executive officer's job level and responsibilities and may vary for different officers and business units.
 
Within 90 days after the beginning of each plan year, the Compensation Committee will establish specific performance objectives for the payment of bonus awards for that plan year. The performance objectives for each plan year will be based on one or more of the following measures: sales, earnings per share, return on net assets, return on equity and customer service levels. These performance objectives are intended to establish the benchmark of success for Staples. The Compensation Committee may determine that special one-time or extraordinary gains or losses, including without limitation as a result of certain acquisitions or divestitures and changes in accounting principles, should or should not be included in determining whether such performance objectives have been met. In addition, customer service target levels will be based on pre-determined tests of customer service levels, including without limitation scores on blind test ("mystery") shopping, customer comment card statistics, customer relations statistics (e.g., number of customer complaints), delivery response levels or customer satisfaction surveys conducted by a third party.
 
For each plan year, a specified percentage of each executive officer's Target Award will be based upon each of the performance objectives selected by the Compensation Committee for that plan year. For the 2008 plan year, the performance objectives are based on earnings per share, return on net assets and customer service goals. For each of the performance objectives, a specified percentage of the portion of the Target Award that is based on that particular performance objective will be paid based on the level of performance achieved.  Each performance objective has a threshold performance level that must be achieved for any of the bonus award to be paid for such objective. No bonus will be paid under the Incentive Plan for a plan year if the minimum earnings per share goal established for such plan year is not achieved, regardless of whether any other performance objective is achieved. If an executive officer dies before the end of a plan year, however, a bonus award based on target performance will be paid within 60 days of the executive officer's death.  The maximum bonus award payable to any executive officer for any plan year will be $4 million. In addition, the Compensation Committee presently intends to limit bonus awards to 200% of an executive officer's Target Award.
 
A more detailed description of the Incentive Plan is included in Proposal Three of the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2008 (the "2008 Proxy Statement").
 
This summary of the Incentive Plan is qualified by reference to the full text of the Incentive Plan, as included as Appendix A to the 2008 Proxy Statement and attached to this report as Exhibit 10.3, which is incorporated herein by reference as though it were fully set forth herein.
 
Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
The stockholders of the Company also approved an amendment to Staples' Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") to increase the number of shares issuable under the Stock Plan by 15,100,000 shares, from 62,330,000 shares to
 
 
 
77,430,000 shares. Officers, directors, consultants, advisors and other service providers are eligible for grants under the Stock Plan.  The Stock Plan was included as Appendix B to the 2008 Proxy Statement and is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.4.

Dated as of
June 9, 2008
Commercial Paper Dealer Agreement
4(2) Program
 
This agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, the "Agreement") sets forth the understandings between the Issuer and the Dealer, each named on the cover page hereof, in connection with the issuance and sale by the Issuer of its short-term promissory notes (the "Notes") through the Dealer.
 
Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 6 hereof.
 
The Addendum to this Agreement, and any Annexes or Exhibits described in this Agreement or such Addendum, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and made fully a part hereof.
 
1.
    
Offers, Sales and Resales of Notes.
 
1.1
      
While (i) the Issuer has and shall have no obligation to sell the Notes to the Dealer or to permit the Dealer to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, and (ii) the Dealer has and shall have no obligation to purchase the Notes from the Issuer or to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, the parties hereto agree that in any case where the Dealer purchases Notes from the Issuer, or arranges for the sale of Notes by the Issuer, such Notes will be purchased or sold by the Dealer in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Issuer contained herein or made pursuant hereto and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.
 
1.2
      
So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, and in addition to the limitations contained in Section 1.7 hereof, the Issuer shall not, without the consent of the Dealer, offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes except (a) in transactions with one or more dealers which may from time to time after the date hereof become dealers with respect to the Notes by executing with the Issuer one or more agreements which contain provisions substantially identical to those contained in Section 1 of this Agreement, of which the Issuer hereby undertakes to provide the Dealer prompt notice or (b) in transactions with the other dealers listed on the Addendum hereto, which are executing agreements with the Issuer which contain provisions substantially identical to Section 1 of this Agreement contemporaneously herewith.  In no event shall the Issuer offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes directly on its own behalf in transactions with persons other than broker-dealers as specifically permitted in this Section 1.2.
 
1.3
      
The Notes shall be in a minimum denomination of $250,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, will bear such interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at such discount from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon by the Dealer and the Issuer, shall have a maturity not exceeding 397 days from the date of issuance and may have such terms as are specified in Exhibit C hereto or the Private Placement Memorandum.  The Notes shall not contain any provision for extension, renewal or automatic "rollover."
 
1.4
      
The authentication and issuance of, and payment for, the Notes shall be effected in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement, and the Notes shall be either individual physical certificates or book-entry notes evidenced by one or more master notes (each, a "Master Note") registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee, in the form or forms annexed to the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement.
1.5
      
If the Issuer and the Dealer shall agree on the terms of the purchase of any Note by the Dealer or the sale of any Note arranged by the Dealer (including, but not limited to, agreement with respect to the date of issue, purchase price, principal amount, maturity and interest rate or interest rate index and margin (in the case of interest-bearing Notes) or discount thereof (in the case of Notes issued on a discount basis), and appropriate compensation for the Dealer's services hereunder) pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer shall cause such Note to be issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement and payment for such Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof, either directly or through the Dealer, to the Issuing and Paying Agent, for the account of the Issuer.  Except as otherwise agreed, in the event that the Dealer is acting as an agent and a purchaser shall either fail to accept delivery of or make payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, the Dealer shall promptly notify the Issuer, and if the Dealer has theretofore paid the Issuer for the Note, the Issuer will promptly return such funds to the Dealer against its return of the Note to the Issuer, in the case of a certificated Note, and upon notice of such failure in the case of a book-entry Note.  If such failure occurred for any reason other than default by the Dealer, the Issuer shall reimburse the Dealer on an equitable basis for the Dealer's loss of the use of such funds for the period such funds were credited to the Issuer's account.
 
1.6
      
All offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer shall be effected pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(2) thereof, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.  The Dealer and the Issuer hereby establish and agree to observe the following procedures in connection with offers, sales and subsequent resales or other transfers of the Notes:
 
(a)
  
Offers and sales of the Notes by or through the Dealer shall be made only to: (i) investors reasonably believed by the Dealer to be Qualified Institutional Buyers, Institutional Accredited Investors or Sophisticated Individual Accredited Investors and (ii) non-bank fiduciaries or agents that will be purchasing Notes for one or more accounts, each of which is reasonably believed by the Dealer to be an Institutional Accredited Investor or Sophisticated Individual Accredited Investor.
 
(b)
  
Resales and other transfers of the Notes by the holders thereof shall be made only in accordance with the restrictions in the legend described in clause (e) below.
 
(c)
  
No general solicitation or general advertising shall be used in connection with the offering of the Notes.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the prior written approval of the Dealer, the Issuer shall not issue any press release or place or publish any "tombstone" or other advertisement relating to the Notes.
 
(d)
  
No sale of Notes to any one purchaser shall be for less than $250,000 principal or face amount, and no Note shall be issued in a smaller principal or face amount.  If the purchaser is a non-bank fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom such purchaser is acting must purchase at least $250,000 principal or face amount of Notes.
 
(e)
  
Offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer through the Dealer acting as agent for the Issuer shall be made in accordance with Rule 506 under the Securities Act, and shall be subject to the restrictions described in the legend appearing on Exhibit A hereto.  A legend substantially to the effect of such Exhibit A shall appear as part of the Private Placement
Memorandum used in connection with offers and sales of Notes hereunder, as well as on each individual certificate representing a Note and each Master Note representing book-entry Notes offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(f)
   
The Dealer shall furnish or shall have furnished to each purchaser of Notes for which it has acted as the Dealer a copy of the then-current Private Placement Memorandum unless such purchaser has previously received a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum as then in effect.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall expressly state that any person to whom Notes are offered shall have an opportunity to ask questions of, and receive information from, the Issuer and the Dealer and shall provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the persons from whom information regarding the Issuer may be obtained.
 
(g)
  
The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Dealer and each of the holders and prospective purchasers from time to time of the Notes that, if at any time the Issuer shall not be subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish, upon request and at its expense, to the Dealer and to holders and prospective purchasers of Notes information required by Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) in compliance with Rule 144A(d).
 
(h)
  
In the event that any Note offered or to be offered by the Dealer would be ineligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Issuer shall immediately notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of such fact and shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Dealer an amendment or supplement to the Private Placement Memorandum describing the Notes that are ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility and any other relevant information relating thereto.
 
(i)
   
The Issuer represents that it is not currently issuing commercial paper in the United States market in reliance upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  The Issuer agrees that, if it shall issue commercial paper after the date hereof in reliance upon such exemption (a) the proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be segregated from the proceeds of the sale of any such commercial paper by being placed in a separate account; (b) the Issuer will institute appropriate corporate procedures to ensure that the offers and sales of notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Section 3(a)(3) exemption are not integrated with offerings and sales of Notes hereunder; and (c) the Issuer will comply with each of the requirements of Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act in selling commercial paper or other short-term debt securities other than the Notes in the United States.  The Dealer agrees with the Issuer not to offer or sell any Notes in a manner that might call into question the availability of the private offering exemption contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 144A thereunder, it being agreed that the foregoing procedures do not call into question the availability of such exemption.
 
1.7
          
The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Dealer, in connection with offers, sales and resales of Notes, as follows:
 
(a)
  
The Issuer hereby confirms to the Dealer that (except as permitted by Section 1.6(i)) within the preceding six months neither the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof acting on behalf of the Issuer has offered or sold any Notes, or any substantially similar security of the Issuer (including, without limitation, medium-term notes issued by the Issuer), to, or solicited offers to buy any such security from,
any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof.  The Issuer also agrees that (except as permitted by Section 1.6(i)), as long as the Notes are being offered for sale by the Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof as contemplated hereby and until at least six months after the offer of Notes hereunder has been terminated, neither the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof (except as contemplated by Section 1.2 hereof) will offer the Notes or any substantially similar security of the Issuer for sale to, or solicit offers to buy any such security from, any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof, it being understood that such agreement is made with a view to bringing the offer and sale of the Notes within the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 thereunder and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Issuer hereby represents and warrants that it has not taken or omitted to take, and will not take or omit to take, any action that would cause the offering and sale of Notes hereunder to be integrated with any other offering of securities, whether such offering is made by the Issuer or some other party or parties, under circumstances that would cause the offering and sale of the Notes by the Issuer to fail to be exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
 
(b)
  
The Issuer represents and agrees that the proceeds of the sale of the Notes are not currently contemplated to be used for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities within the meaning of Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In the event that the Issuer determines to use proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities, whether in connection with an acquisition of another company or otherwise, the Issuer shall give the Dealer at least three business days' prior written notice to that effect.  The Issuer shall also give the Dealer prompt notice of the actual date that it commences to purchase securities with the proceeds of the Notes.  Thereafter, in the event that the Dealer purchases Notes as principal and does not resell such Notes on the day of such purchase, to the extent necessary to comply with Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder, the Dealer will sell such Notes either (i) only to offerees it reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or to Qualified Institutional Buyers it reasonably believes are acting for other Qualified Institutional Buyers, in each case in accordance with Rule 144A or (ii) in a manner which would not cause a violation of Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder.
 
2.

3.2
    
The Issuer shall, whenever there shall occur any change in the financial condition or operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or any development or occurrence in relation to the Issuer that would have a material adverse effect on holders of the Notes or potential holders of the Notes (including any downgrading or receipt of any notice of intended downgrading in the rating accorded any of the Issuer's securities by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization which has published a rating of the Notes), promptly, and in any event prior to any subsequent issuance of Notes hereunder, notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of such change, development or occurrence.

3.4
    
The Issuer will take all such action as the Dealer may reasonably request to ensure that each offer and each sale of the Notes will comply with any applicable state Blue Sky laws; provided,
however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.
 
3.5

Disclosure.

4.2
    
The Issuer agrees to promptly furnish the Dealer the Company Information as it becomes available.
 
4.3
    
(a)  The Issuer further agrees to notify the Dealer promptly upon the occurrence of any event relating to or affecting the Issuer that would cause the Company Information then in existence to include an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall have no obligation to so notify the Dealer if (i) the Issuer has temporarily suspended offers and sales of the Notes and
has given the Dealer written notice of such suspension, or (ii) there are no Notes outstanding.  In the event that the Issuer wishes to resume offers and sales of the Notes, it shall (i) give the Dealer notice thereof, and (ii) either (x) confirm that the then current Private Placement Memorandum and Company Information do not violate the representation contained in Section 3.11  of this Agreement, or (y) if the representation contained in Section 2.11 cannot be made, provide to the Dealer an updated Private Placement Memorandum that will permit the representation to be made.  The Dealer agrees that, upon such notification, all solicitations and sales of Notes shall be suspended.
 
(b)
  
In the event that the Issuer gives the Dealer notice pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and the Dealer notifies the Issuer that it then has Notes it is holding in inventory, (i) the Issuer agrees promptly to supplement or amend the Private Placement Memorandum so that the Private Placement Memorandum, as amended or supplemented, shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Issuer shall make such supplement or amendment available to the Dealer or (ii) if the Issuer chooses not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum, the Issuer shall, if required by the Dealer, purchase from the Dealer any such Notes held in inventory at a price equal to the face amount thereof discounted on a ratable basis based on the Issuer's market rate reflecting the remaining period until maturity in relation to the original term, provided that no commissions or fees will be paid to such Dealer in connection with any such repurchase pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)(ii).
 
(c)
  
In the event that (i) the Issuer gives the Dealer notice pursuant to Section 4.3(a), (ii) the Dealer does not notify the Issuer that it is then holding Notes in inventory and (iii) the Issuer chooses not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in the manner described in clause (b) above, then all solicitations and sales of Notes shall be suspended until such time as the Issuer has so amended or supplemented the Private Placement Memorandum, and made such amendment or supplement available to the Dealer.
 
(d)
  
Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), the Issuer shall review, amend and supplement the Private Placement Memorandum on a periodic basis, but no less than at least once annually, to incorporate current financial information of the Issuer to the extent necessary to ensure that the information provided in the Private Placement Memorandum is accurate and complete

in or pursuant to this Agreement.  This indemnification shall not apply to the extent that the Claim arises out of or is based upon Dealer Information or that the Claim is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from an Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
5.2
    
Provisions relating to claims made for indemnification under this Section 5 are set forth on Exhibit B to this Agreement.
 
5.3
    
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is held to be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the Indemnitees, although applicable in accordance with the terms of this Section 5, the Issuer shall contribute to the aggregate costs incurred by the Dealer in connection with any Claim in the proportion of the respective economic interests of the Issuer and the Dealer; provided, however, that such contribution by the Issuer shall be in an amount such that the aggregate costs incurred by the Dealer do not exceed the aggregate of the commissions and fees earned by the Dealer hereunder with respect to the issue or issues of Notes to which such Claim relates.

Exhibit B
 
Further Provisions Relating to Indemnification
 
(a)
  
The Issuer agrees to reimburse each Indemnitee for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of internal and external counsel) as they are incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect of which indemnification may be sought under Section 5 of the Agreement (whether or not it is a party to any such proceedings).
 
(b)
  
Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence of a Claim, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer in writing of the existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve the Issuer from any liability which it may have hereunder unless and except to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Issuer of substantial rights and defenses, and (ii) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve it from liability which it may have to an Indemnitee otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In case any such Claim is made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the existence thereof, the Issuer will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee; provided that if the defendants in any such Claim include both the Indemnitee and the Issuer, and the Indemnitee shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Claim on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee.  Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuer's election so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the Indemnitee of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such Indemnitee for expenses incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel in the jurisdiction in which any Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer, representing the Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of existence of the Claim or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnitee.  The indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the Issuer may otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Issuer and any Indemnitee.  The Issuer agrees that without the Dealer's prior written consent, it will not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought under the indemnification provision of the Agreement (whether or not the Dealer or any other Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Claim), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnitee.
Exhibit C
 
Statement of Terms for Interest  Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of Staples, Inc.
 
THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM SUPPLEMENT (THE "SUPPLEMENT") (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.
 
1.    (a)  The obligations of the Issuer to which these terms apply (each a "Note") are represented by one or more Master Notes (each, a "Master Note") issued in the name of (or of a nominee for) The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), which Master Note includes the terms and provisions for the Issuer's Interest-Bearing Commercial Paper Notes that are set forth in this Statement of Terms, since this Statement of Terms constitutes an integral part of the Underlying Records as defined and referred to in the Master Note.
General.
 
(b)  "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, executive order or regulation to be closed in New York City and, with respect to LIBOR Notes (as defined below) is also a London Business Day.  "London Business Day" means, a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
2.    (a)  Each Note will bear interest at a fixed rate (a "Fixed Rate Note") or at a floating rate (a "Floating Rate Note").
Interest.
 
(b)  The Supplement sent to each holder of such Note will describe the following terms: (i) whether such Note is a Fixed Rate Note or a Floating Rate Note and whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note (as defined below); (ii) the date on which such Note will be issued (the "Issue Date"); (iii) the Stated Maturity Date (as defined below); (iv) if such Note is a Fixed Rate Note, the rate per annum at which such Note will bear interest, if any, and the Interest Payment Dates; (v) if such Note is a Floating Rate Note, the Base Rate, the Index Maturity, the Interest Reset Dates, the Interest Payment Dates and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any (all as defined below), and any other terms relating to the particular method of calculating the interest rate for such Note; and (vi) any other terms applicable specifically to such Note.  "Original Issue Discount Note" means a Note which has a stated redemption price at the Stated Maturity Date that exceeds its Issue Price by more than a specified de minimis amount and which the Supplement indicates will be an "Original Issue Discount Note".
 
(c)  Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount thereof is paid or made available for payment.  Interest on each Fixed Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement (each an "Interest Payment Date" for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the Maturity Date (as defined below).  Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date of a Fixed Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable on the
next succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.
 
(d)  The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to an interest rate basis (a "Base Rate") plus or minus a number of basis points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point) (the "Spread"), if any, and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the "Spread Multiplier"), if any, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment.  The Supplement will designate which of the following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note: (a) the CD Rate (a "CD Rate Note"), (b) the Commercial Paper Rate (a "Commercial Paper Rate Note"), (c) the Federal Funds Rate (a "Federal Funds Rate Note"), (d) LIBOR (a "LIBOR Note"), (e) the Prime Rate (a "Prime Rate Note"), (f) the Treasury Rate (a "Treasury Rate Note") or (g) such other Base Rate as may be specified in such Supplement.
 
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the "Interest Reset Period").  The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an "Interest Reset Date") will be, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (the "Interest Payment Period") and on the Maturity Date.  Unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below, the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an "Interest Payment Date" for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  In addition, the Maturity Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.
 
If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.  If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such maturity.
 
Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.  On the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date.  Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors
calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate.  The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier.
 
The "Interest Determination Date" where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned.  Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday.  If an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week.
 
The "Index Maturity" is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.
 
The "Calculation Date," where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date.
 
All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified.
 
The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent") with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.  The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards.  For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655).  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).
 
CD Rate Notes
 
"CD Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(the "FRB") in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the FRB ("H.15(519)") under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)".
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the world wide website of the FRB at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate ("H.15 Daily Update") under the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)".
 
If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers(2)  in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
Commercial Paper Rate Notes
 
"Commercial Paper Rate" means the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate will be the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for commercial paper of the Index Maturity as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".
 
If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
"Money Market Yield" will be a yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
 
(2)   Such nonbank dealers referred to in this Statement of Terms may include affiliates of the Dealer.
where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being calculated.
 
Federal Funds Rate Notes
 
"Federal Funds Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for Federal Funds as published in Reuters (or any successor service) on page FEDFUNDS1 under the heading "EFFECT" (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) ("Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1").
 
If the above rate does not appear on Reuters Page FEDFUNDS1 or is not so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update under the heading "Federal Funds/(Effective)".
 
If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date.
 
If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
LIBOR Notes
 
The London Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.
 
If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the Calculation Agent's judgment is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a "Representative Amount").  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment Period.
 
"Designated LIBOR Page" means Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page or any replacement page or pages on which London interbank rates of major banks for the Index Currency are displayed.
Prime Rate Notes
 
"Prime Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan".
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite the caption "Bank Prime Loan".
 
If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.
 
If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.
 
If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
"Reuters Screen US Prime1 Page" means the display designated as page "USPrime1" of the Reuters Service, or any successor service, or any replacement page or pages on that service, for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.

Commercial Paper Dealer Agreement
4(2) Program
 
This agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, the "Agreement") sets forth the understandings between the Issuer and the Dealer, each named on the cover page hereof, in connection with the issuance and sale by the Issuer of its short-term promissory notes (the "Notes") through the Dealer.
 
Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 6 hereof.
 
The Addendum to this Agreement, and any Annexes or Exhibits described in this Agreement or such Addendum, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and made fully a part hereof.
 
1.
    
Offers, Sales and Resales of Notes.
 
1.1
      
While (i) the Issuer has and shall have no obligation to sell the Notes to the Dealer or to permit the Dealer to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, and (ii) the Dealer has and shall have no obligation to purchase the Notes from the Issuer or to arrange any sale of the Notes for the account of the Issuer, the parties hereto agree that in any case where the Dealer purchases Notes from the Issuer, or arranges for the sale of Notes by the Issuer, such Notes will be purchased or sold by the Dealer in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Issuer contained herein or made pursuant hereto and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.
 
1.2
      
So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, and in addition to the limitations contained in Section 1.7 hereof, the Issuer shall not, without the consent of the Dealer, offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes except (a) in transactions with one or more dealers which may from time to time after the date hereof become dealers with respect to the Notes by executing with the Issuer one or more agreements which contain provisions substantially identical to those contained in Section 1 of this Agreement, of which the Issuer hereby undertakes to provide the Dealer prompt notice or (b) in transactions with the other dealers listed on the Addendum hereto, which are executing agreements with the Issuer which contain provisions substantially identical to Section 1 of this Agreement contemporaneously herewith.  In no event shall the Issuer offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes directly on its own behalf in transactions with persons other than broker-dealers as specifically permitted in this Section 1.2.
 
1.3
      
The Notes shall be in a minimum denomination of $250,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, will bear such interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at such discount from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon by the Dealer and the Issuer, shall have a maturity not exceeding 397 days from the date of issuance and may have such terms as are specified in Exhibit C hereto or the Private Placement Memorandum.  The Notes shall not contain any provision for extension, renewal or automatic "rollover."
 
1.4
      
The authentication and issuance of, and payment for, the Notes shall be effected in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement, and the Notes shall be either individual physical certificates or book-entry notes evidenced by one or more master notes (each, a "Master Note") registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee, in the form or forms annexed to the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement.
1.5
      
If the Issuer and the Dealer shall agree on the terms of the purchase of any Note by the Dealer or the sale of any Note arranged by the Dealer (including, but not limited to, agreement with respect to the date of issue, purchase price, principal amount, maturity and interest rate or interest rate index and margin (in the case of interest-bearing Notes) or discount thereof (in the case of Notes issued on a discount basis), and appropriate compensation for the Dealer's services hereunder) pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer shall cause such Note to be issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement and payment for such Note shall be made by the purchaser thereof, either directly or through the Dealer, to the Issuing and Paying Agent, for the account of the Issuer.  Except as otherwise agreed, in the event that the Dealer is acting as an agent and a purchaser shall either fail to accept delivery of or make payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, the Dealer shall promptly notify the Issuer, and if the Dealer has theretofore paid the Issuer for the Note, the Issuer will promptly return such funds to the Dealer against its return of the Note to the Issuer, in the case of a certificated Note, and upon notice of such failure in the case of a book-entry Note.  If such failure occurred for any reason other than default by the Dealer, the Issuer shall reimburse the Dealer on an equitable basis for the Dealer's loss of the use of such funds for the period such funds were credited to the Issuer's account.
 
1.6
      
All offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer shall be effected pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(2) thereof, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.  The Dealer and the Issuer hereby establish and agree to observe the following procedures in connection with offers, sales and subsequent resales or other transfers of the Notes:
 
(a)
  
Offers and sales of the Notes by or through the Dealer shall be made only to: (i) investors reasonably believed by the Dealer to be Qualified Institutional Buyers, Institutional Accredited Investors or Sophisticated Individual Accredited Investors and (ii) non-bank fiduciaries or agents that will be purchasing Notes for one or more accounts, each of which is reasonably believed by the Dealer to be an Institutional Accredited Investor or Sophisticated Individual Accredited Investor.
 
(b)
  
Resales and other transfers of the Notes by the holders thereof shall be made only in accordance with the restrictions in the legend described in clause (e) below.
 
(c)
  
No general solicitation or general advertising shall be used in connection with the offering of the Notes.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the prior written approval of the Dealer, the Issuer shall not issue any press release or place or publish any "tombstone" or other advertisement relating to the Notes.
 
(d)
  
No sale of Notes to any one purchaser shall be for less than $250,000 principal or face amount, and no Note shall be issued in a smaller principal or face amount.  If the purchaser is a non-bank fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom such purchaser is acting must purchase at least $250,000 principal or face amount of Notes.
 
(e)
  
Offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer through the Dealer acting as agent for the Issuer shall be made in accordance with Rule 506 under the Securities Act, and shall be subject to the restrictions described in the legend appearing on Exhibit A hereto.  A legend substantially to the effect of such Exhibit A shall appear as part of the Private Placement
Memorandum used in connection with offers and sales of Notes hereunder, as well as on each individual certificate representing a Note and each Master Note representing book-entry Notes offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(f)
   
The Dealer shall furnish or shall have furnished to each purchaser of Notes for which it has acted as the Dealer a copy of the then-current Private Placement Memorandum unless such purchaser has previously received a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum as then in effect.  The Private Placement Memorandum shall expressly state that any person to whom Notes are offered shall have an opportunity to ask questions of, and receive information from, the Issuer and the Dealer and shall provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the persons from whom information regarding the Issuer may be obtained.
 
(g)
  
The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Dealer and each of the holders and prospective purchasers from time to time of the Notes that, if at any time the Issuer shall not be subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish, upon request and at its expense, to the Dealer and to holders and prospective purchasers of Notes information required by Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) in compliance with Rule 144A(d).
 
(h)
  
In the event that any Note offered or to be offered by the Dealer would be ineligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Issuer shall immediately notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of such fact and shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Dealer an amendment or supplement to the Private Placement Memorandum describing the Notes that are ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility and any other relevant information relating thereto.
 
(i)
   
The Issuer represents that it is not currently issuing commercial paper in the United States market in reliance upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  The Issuer agrees that, if it shall issue commercial paper after the date hereof in reliance upon such exemption (a) the proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be segregated from the proceeds of the sale of any such commercial paper by being placed in a separate account; (b) the Issuer will institute appropriate corporate procedures to ensure that the offers and sales of notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Section 3(a)(3) exemption are not integrated with offerings and sales of Notes hereunder; and (c) the Issuer will comply with each of the requirements of Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act in selling commercial paper or other short-term debt securities other than the Notes in the United States.  The Dealer agrees with the Issuer not to offer or sell any Notes in a manner that might call into question the availability of the private offering exemption contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 144A thereunder, it being agreed that the foregoing procedures do not call into question the availability of such exemption.
 
1.7
          
The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Dealer, in connection with offers, sales and resales of Notes, as follows:
 
(a)
  
The Issuer hereby confirms to the Dealer that (except as permitted by Section 1.6(i)) within the preceding six months neither the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof acting on behalf of the Issuer has offered or sold any Notes, or any substantially similar security of the Issuer (including, without limitation, medium-term notes issued by the Issuer), to, or solicited offers to buy any such security from,
any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof.  The Issuer also agrees that (except as permitted by Section 1.6(i)), as long as the Notes are being offered for sale by the Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof as contemplated hereby and until at least six months after the offer of Notes hereunder has been terminated, neither the Issuer nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof (except as contemplated by Section 1.2 hereof) will offer the Notes or any substantially similar security of the Issuer for sale to, or solicit offers to buy any such security from, any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof, it being understood that such agreement is made with a view to bringing the offer and sale of the Notes within the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 thereunder and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Issuer hereby represents and warrants that it has not taken or omitted to take, and will not take or omit to take, any action that would cause the offering and sale of Notes hereunder to be integrated with any other offering of securities, whether such offering is made by the Issuer or some other party or parties, under circumstances that would cause the offering and sale of the Notes by the Issuer to fail to be exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
 
(b)
  
The Issuer represents and agrees that the proceeds of the sale of the Notes are not currently contemplated to be used for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities within the meaning of Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  In the event that the Issuer determines to use proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the purpose of buying, carrying or trading securities, whether in connection with an acquisition of another company or otherwise, the Issuer shall give the Dealer at least three business days' prior written notice to that effect.  The Issuer shall also give the Dealer prompt notice of the actual date that it commences to purchase securities with the proceeds of the Notes.  Thereafter, in the event that the Dealer purchases Notes as principal and does not resell such Notes on the day of such purchase, to the extent necessary to comply with Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder, the Dealer will sell such Notes either (i) only to offerees it reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or to Qualified Institutional Buyers it reasonably believes are acting for other Qualified Institutional Buyers, in each case in accordance with Rule 144A or (ii) in a manner which would not cause a violation of Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder.
 
2.
    
Representations and Warranties of Issuer.
 
The Issuer represents and warrants that:
 
2.1
      
The Issuer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Notes, this Agreement and the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement.

2.3
      
The Notes have been duly authorized, and when issued as provided in the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
2.4
      
Assuming compliance by the Dealer with the procedures applicable to it set forth in Section 1 hereof, the offer and sale of the Notes in the manner contemplated hereby do not require registration of the Notes under the Securities Act, pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) thereof, and no indenture in respect of the Notes is required to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
 
2.5

3.3
    
The Issuer shall from time to time furnish to the Dealer such information as the Dealer may reasonably request, including, without limitation, any press releases or material provided by the Issuer to any national securities exchange or rating agency, regarding (i) the Issuer's operations and financial condition, (ii) the due authorization and execution of the Notes and (iii) the Issuer's ability to pay the Notes as they mature.
 
3.4
    
The Issuer will take all such action as the Dealer may reasonably request to ensure that each offer and each sale of the Notes will comply with any applicable state Blue Sky laws; provided,
however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.
 
3.5
    
The Issuer will not be in default of any of its obligations hereunder, under the Notes or under the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement, at any time that any of the Notes are outstanding.

4.2
    
The Issuer agrees to promptly furnish the Dealer the Company Information as it becomes available.
 
4.3
    
(a)  The Issuer further agrees to notify the Dealer promptly upon the occurrence of any event relating to or affecting the Issuer that would cause the Company Information then in existence to include an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall have no obligation to so notify the Dealer if (i) the Issuer has temporarily suspended offers and sales of the Notes and
has given the Dealer written notice of such suspension, or (ii) there are no Notes outstanding.  In the event that the Issuer wishes to resume offers and sales of the Notes, it shall (i) give the Dealer notice thereof, and (ii) either (x) confirm that the then current Private Placement Memorandum and Company Information do not violate the representation contained in Section 3.11  of this Agreement, or (y) if the representation contained in Section 2.11 cannot be made, provide to the Dealer an updated Private Placement Memorandum that will permit the representation to be made.  The Dealer agrees that, upon such notification, all solicitations and sales of Notes shall be suspended.
 
(b)
  
In the event that the Issuer gives the Dealer notice pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and the Dealer notifies the Issuer that it then has Notes it is holding in inventory, (i) the Issuer agrees promptly to supplement or amend the Private Placement Memorandum so that the Private Placement Memorandum, as amended or supplemented, shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Issuer shall make such supplement or amendment available to the Dealer or (ii) if the Issuer chooses not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum, the Issuer shall, if required by the Dealer, purchase from the Dealer any such Notes held in inventory at a price equal to the face amount thereof discounted on a ratable basis based on the Issuer's market rate reflecting the remaining period until maturity in relation to the original term, provided that no commissions or fees will be paid to such Dealer in connection with any such repurchase pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)(ii).
 
(c)
  
In the event that (i) the Issuer gives the Dealer notice pursuant to Section 4.3(a), (ii) the Dealer does not notify the Issuer that it is then holding Notes in inventory and (iii) the Issuer chooses not to promptly amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in the manner described in clause (b) above, then all solicitations and sales of Notes shall be suspended until such time as the Issuer has so amended or supplemented the Private Placement Memorandum, and made such amendment or supplement available to the Dealer.
 
(d)
  
Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), the Issuer shall review, amend and supplement the Private Placement Memorandum on a periodic basis, but no less than at least once annually, to incorporate current financial information of the Issuer to the extent necessary to ensure that the information provided in the Private Placement Memorandum is accurate and complete

in or pursuant to this Agreement.  This indemnification shall not apply to the extent that the Claim arises out of or is based upon Dealer Information or that the Claim is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from an Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
5.2
    
Provisions relating to claims made for indemnification under this Section 5 are set forth on Exhibit B to this Agreement.
 
5.3

Further Provisions Relating to Indemnification
 
(a)
         
The Issuer agrees to reimburse each Indemnitee for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of internal and external counsel) as they are incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect of which indemnification may be sought under Section 5 of the Agreement (whether or not it is a party to any such proceedings).
 
(b)
        
Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence of a Claim, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer in writing of the existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve the Issuer from any liability which it may have hereunder unless and except to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the forfeiture by the Issuer of substantial rights and defenses, and (ii) the omission so to notify the Issuer will not relieve it from liability which it may have to an Indemnitee otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In case any such Claim is made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the existence thereof, the Issuer will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee; provided that if the defendants in any such Claim include both the Indemnitee and the Issuer, and the Indemnitee shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Claim on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee.  Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuer's election so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the Indemnitee of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such Indemnitee for expenses incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel in the jurisdiction in which any Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer, representing the Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of existence of the Claim or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the Indemnitee.  The indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the Issuer may otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Issuer and any Indemnitee.

Exhibit C
 
Statement of Terms for Interest  Bearing Commercial Paper Notes of Staples, Inc.
 
THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE QUALIFIED TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE BY THE TRANSACTION SPECIFIC PRIVATE PLACEMENT MEMORANDUM SUPPLEMENT (THE "SUPPLEMENT") (IF ANY) SENT TO EACH PURCHASER AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.
 
1.    (a)  The obligations of the Issuer to which these terms apply (each a "Note") are represented by one or more Master Notes (each, a "Master Note") issued in the name of (or of a nominee for) The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), which Master Note includes the terms and provisions for the Issuer's Interest-Bearing Commercial Paper Notes that are set forth in this Statement of Terms, since this Statement of Terms constitutes an integral part of the Underlying Records as defined and referred to in the Master Note.
General.
 
(b)  "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, executive order or regulation to be closed in New York City and, with respect to LIBOR Notes (as defined below) is also a London Business Day.  "London Business Day" means, a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
2.    (a)  Each Note will bear interest at a fixed rate (a "Fixed Rate Note") or at a floating rate (a "Floating Rate Note").
Interest.
 
(b)  The Supplement sent to each holder of such Note will describe the following terms: (i) whether such Note is a Fixed Rate Note or a Floating Rate Note and whether such Note is an Original Issue Discount Note (as defined below); (ii) the date on which such Note will be issued (the "Issue Date"); (iii) the Stated Maturity Date (as defined below); (iv) if such Note is a Fixed Rate Note, the rate per annum at which such Note will bear interest, if any, and the Interest Payment Dates; (v) if such Note is a Floating Rate Note, the Base Rate, the Index Maturity, the Interest Reset Dates, the Interest Payment Dates and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any (all as defined below), and any other terms relating to the particular method of calculating the interest rate for such Note; and (vi) any other terms applicable specifically to such Note.  "Original Issue Discount Note" means a Note which has a stated redemption price at the Stated Maturity Date that exceeds its Issue Price by more than a specified de minimis amount and which the Supplement indicates will be an "Original Issue Discount Note".
 
(c)  Each Fixed Rate Note will bear interest from its Issue Date at the rate per annum specified in the Supplement until the principal amount thereof is paid or made available for payment.  Interest on each Fixed Rate Note will be payable on the dates specified in the Supplement (each an "Interest Payment Date" for a Fixed Rate Note) and on the Maturity Date (as defined below).  Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date of a Fixed Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be payable on the
next succeeding Business Day, and no additional interest will accrue in respect of the payment made on that next succeeding Business Day.
 
(d)  The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note for each Interest Reset Period (as defined below) will be determined by reference to an interest rate basis (a "Base Rate") plus or minus a number of basis points (one basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point) (the "Spread"), if any, and/or multiplied by a certain percentage (the "Spread Multiplier"), if any, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment.  The Supplement will designate which of the following Base Rates is applicable to the related Floating Rate Note: (a) the CD Rate (a "CD Rate Note"), (b) the Commercial Paper Rate (a "Commercial Paper Rate Note"), (c) the Federal Funds Rate (a "Federal Funds Rate Note"), (d) LIBOR (a "LIBOR Note"), (e) the Prime Rate (a "Prime Rate Note"), (f) the Treasury Rate (a "Treasury Rate Note") or (g) such other Base Rate as may be specified in such Supplement.
 
The rate of interest on each Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or semi-annually (the "Interest Reset Period").  The date or dates on which interest will be reset (each an "Interest Reset Date") will be, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset daily, each Business Day, in the case of Floating Rate Notes (other than Treasury Rate Notes) that reset weekly, the Wednesday of each week; in the case of Treasury Rate Notes that reset weekly, the Tuesday of each week; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on each Floating Rate Note will be payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually (the "Interest Payment Period") and on the Maturity Date.  Unless otherwise specified in the Supplement, and except as provided below, the date or dates on which interest will be payable (each an "Interest Payment Date" for a Floating Rate Note) will be, in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a monthly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of each month; in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December; and in the case of Floating Rate Notes with a semiannual Interest Payment Period, on the third Wednesday of the two months specified in the Supplement.  In addition, the Maturity Date will also be an Interest Payment Date.
 
If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.  If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such maturity.
 
Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.  On the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date.  Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor.  This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors
calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate.  The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and/or a Spread Multiplier.
 
The "Interest Determination Date" where the Base Rate is the CD Rate or the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is LIBOR will be the second London Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date.  The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned.  Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday.  If an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week.
 
The "Index Maturity" is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated.
 
The "Calculation Date," where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date.
 
All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified.
 
The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent") with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.  The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards.  For example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655).  All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).
 
CD Rate Notes
 
"CD Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(the "FRB") in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication of the FRB ("H.15(519)") under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)".
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date set forth in the daily update of H.15(519), available through the world wide website of the FRB at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Update, or any successor site or publication or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate ("H.15 Daily Update") under the caption "CDs (Secondary Market)".
 
If such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the CD Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers(2)  in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity in the denomination of $5,000,000.
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate will remain the CD Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
Commercial Paper Rate Notes
 
"Commercial Paper Rate" means the Money Market Yield (calculated as described below) of the rate on any Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity, as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial".

If by 3:00 p.m. on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Commercial Paper Rate to be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
 
If the dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date will remain the Commercial Paper Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

If such rate is not published as described above by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Federal Funds Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m. on such Interest Determination Date.
 
If the brokers selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds Rate then in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
LIBOR Notes
 
The London Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date, the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.
 
If no rate appears, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in such market selected by the Calculation Agent for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in principal amount equal to an amount that in the Calculation Agent's judgment is representative for a single transaction in U.S. dollars in such market at such time (a "Representative Amount").  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in New York City, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a term equal to the Index Maturity and in a Representative Amount; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are providing such quotations, the then existing LIBOR rate will remain in effect for such Interest Payment Period.
 
"Designated LIBOR Page" means Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page or any replacement page or pages on which London interbank rates of major banks for the Index Currency are displayed.
Prime Rate Notes
 
"Prime Rate" means the rate on any Interest Determination Date as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan".
 
If the above rate is not published in H.15(519) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in H.15 Daily Update opposite the caption "Bank Prime Loan".
 
If the rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen US PRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 a.m., on that Interest Determination Date.
 
If fewer than four such rates referred to above are so published by 3:00 p.m. on the Calculation Date, the Calculation Agent will determine the Prime Rate to be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent.
 
If the banks selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the Prime Rate will remain the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
 
"Reuters Screen US Prime1 Page" means the display designated as page "USPrime1" of the Reuters Service, or any successor service, or any replacement page or pages on that service, for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks.

Exhibit 10.3
 
I.
Summary and Objectives
    
 
Staples, Inc. ("Staples") has developed this Executive Officer Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") to provide opportunities for Plan Participants (as defined below) to earn financial rewards for their role in ensuring that Staples meets its annual performance targets. The Incentive Plan aims to align the interests of the Plan Participants with those of our shareholders. Bonus awards are based on actual results measured against pre-established company financial objectives. Bonus awards are intended to provide a reward to Plan Participants and supplement the base salary program.
 
II.
Term of Plan
   
 
The Incentive Plan will cover five fiscal years, beginning with the 2008 fiscal year (beginning February 3, 2008) and ending with the 2012 fiscal year (ending February 2, 2013). Each such fiscal year is referred to herein as a "Plan Year".
 
III.
Eligibility
 
 
Provided that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") determines that Staples meets the applicable performance objectives for a particular Plan Year, as set forth below, and all other eligibility requirements are met, the following guidelines will be used to determine Plan Participants' bonus award eligibility. Except as set forth in Section III. D with respect to a Plan Participant's death, bonus awards are not guaranteed and will not be paid unless Staples meets the required objectives set forth in the Incentive Plan and the Committee authorizes the payment of bonus awards.
 
A.
General Eligibility Requirements
   
 
Each executive officer of Staples, within the meaning of the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will be eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan, except that an executive officer whose employment terminates prior to the end of a Plan Year, other than as a result of permanent disability, death or retirement, will not be eligible to receive a bonus award under the Incentive Plan for that Plan Year (each a "Plan Participant").
 
B.
Changes in Position
   
 
A Plan Participant who changes from one position to another will be eligible for a prorated bonus award as follows:
 
A Plan Participant who transfers from an Incentive Plan eligible position into a position eligible for another bonus plan is eligible for a prorated bonus award under the Incentive Plan based on the number of days the associate was a Plan Participant during the applicable Plan Year. The associate's eligibility for a bonus for the new position, if any, will be determined in accordance with any applicable bonus plan for that position.
1.
    
 
A Plan Participant who changes from one Incentive Plan eligible position to another, through a promotion, transfer or demotion, is eligible for a prorated bonus award for each position based on the number of days the associate held such position during the applicable Plan Year.
2.
    
 
C.
Leaves of Absence
   
 
A Plan Participant who is on a company-approved leave of absence in excess of 90 days during a Plan Year will not be eligible for a bonus award for the portion of his or her leave over 90 days unless otherwise approved by the Committee.
D.
Retirement, Disability or Death
   
 
  If a Plan Participant terminates his or her employment after attaining age 55 and if at the time of such termination of employment the sum of the years of service (as determined by the Board of Directors of Staples) completed by the associate plus the associate's age is greater than or equal to 65, the associate will be eligible for a prorated bonus award based on the number of days the associate was employed by Staples during the applicable Plan Year.
Retirement:
 
  If a Plan Participant's employment is terminated due to permanent disability before the end of the Plan Year, the associate will be eligible for a prorated bonus award based on the number of days the associate was employed by Staples during the applicable Plan Year.
Disability:
 
In each case described above, no prorated bonus will be paid unless all of the applicable requirements set forth in the Incentive Plan are met, including without limitation that the Committee determines that Staples meets the applicable performance objectives for a particular Plan Year and authorizes the payment of bonus awards.
 
  If a Plan Participant's employment is terminated due to death before the end of the Plan Year, 100% of the Plan Participant's Target Award for such Plan Year will be paid within 60 days of such termination; provided, that if such termination occurs during the Plan Participant's first Plan Year under the Incentive Plan, the bonus award will be prorated based on the number of days the associate was employed by Staples during the applicable Plan Year, calculated as if the associate had been employed by Staples through the end of the Plan Year.
Death:
 
E.
Employment and Compliance
    
 
As described under "General Eligibility Requirements," and except as set forth in Section III. D, a Plan Participant must be employed as of the last day of the Plan Year in order to be eligible for a bonus. If the employment of a Plan Participant terminates during a Plan Year for any reason other than retirement (as defined above), permanent disability or death, no bonus will be paid to the Plan Participant for that Plan Year.
 
In addition, a Plan Participant must comply with all applicable state and federal regulations and Staples' policies (the "Compliance Requirements") in order to be eligible to receive a bonus award under the Incentive Plan. A Plan Participant who is terminated after the end of a Plan Year, but before bonus awards for such Plan Year are distributed, for violating any of the Compliance Requirements will not be eligible to receive a bonus award for such Plan Year.
 
IV.
The Plan
  
 
Within 90 days after the beginning of each Plan Year, the Committee will establish specific performance objectives for the payment of bonus awards for that Plan Year. The performance objectives for each Plan Year will be based on one or more of the following measures: sales, earnings per share, return on net assets, return on equity and customer service levels. These performance objectives are intended to establish the benchmark of success for Staples. The Committee may determine that special one-time or extraordinary gains or losses, including without limitation as a result of certain acquisitions or divestitures and changes in accounting principles, should or should not be included in determining whether such performance objectives have been met. In addition, customer service target levels will be based on pre-determined tests of customer service levels, including without limitation scores on blind test ("mystery") shopping, customer comment card statistics, customer relations statistics (e.g., number of customer complaints), delivery response levels or customer satisfaction surveys conducted by a third party.
 
For each Plan Year, a specified percentage (which may vary from Plan Year to Plan Year) of each Target Award (as defined below) will be based upon each of the performance objectives selected by the Committee for that Plan Year. For each of the performance objectives, a specified percentage of the portion of the Target Award that is based on that particular performance objective will be paid based on the level of performance achieved. Each performance objective has a threshold performance level that must be achieved for any of the bonus award to be paid for such objective. Except as set forth in Section III. D with respect to a Plan Participant's death, no bonus will be paid under the Incentive Plan for a Plan Year if the minimum earnings per share goal established for such Plan Year is not achieved, regardless of whether any other performance objective is achieved. The maximum bonus award payable to an executive officer for any Plan Year is $4 million. In addition, the Committee presently intends to limit bonus awards to 200% of a Plan Participant's Target Award.
V.
Payment Calculations
  
 
Each Plan Participant will have a target bonus award (a "Target Award") for each Plan Year. Target Awards will be expressed as a percentage of the actual base salary paid to the Plan Participant during the Plan Year. The percentages will be determined by the Committee based on the Plan Participant's job level and responsibilities and may vary for different officers or business units. At the end of the Plan Year, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, to be paid to each Plan Participant based on the extent that the performance goals established for the Plan Participant were achieved and shall authorize payment by Staples to the Plan Participant; provided that the Committee may use negative discretion to decrease, but not increase, the amount of any bonus award otherwise payable to a Plan Participant.

Administration
   
 
The Incentive Plan will be administered by the Committee.

D.
Rights are Non-Assignable

Exhibit 10.4
1.
Purpose
             
 
The purpose of this Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") of Staples, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), is to advance the interests of the Company's stockholders by enhancing the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who make (or are expected to make) important contributions to the Company by providing such persons with equity ownership opportunities and performance-based incentives and thereby better aligning the interests of such persons with those of the Company's stockholders. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), and any other business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company has a controlling interest, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board").
 
2.
Eligibility
             
 
All of the Company's employees, officers, directors, consultants, advisors, and other service providers (including persons who have entered into an agreement with the Company under which they will be employed by the Company in the future) are eligible to be granted options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights or other stock-based awards (each, an "Award") under the Plan. Each person who has been granted an Award under the Plan shall be deemed a "Participant".
 
3.
Administration and Delegation
             
 
The Plan will be administered by the Board. The Board shall have authority to grant Awards and to adopt, amend and repeal such administrative rules, guidelines and practices relating to the Plan as it shall deem advisable. The Board may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. All decisions by the Board shall be made in the Board's sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all persons having or claiming any interest in the Plan or in any Award. No director or person acting pursuant to the authority delegated by the Board shall be liable for any action or determination relating to or under the Plan made in good faith.
(a)
Administration by Board of Directors.
         
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to one or more committees or subcommittees of the Board (a "Committee"). Unless otherwise determined by the Board, if a Committee is authorized to grant Awards to a Covered Employee (as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code), such Committee shall be comprised solely of two or more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. All references in the Plan to the "Board" shall mean the Board or a Committee of the Board or the officers referred to in Section 3(c) to the extent that the Board's powers or authority under the Plan have been delegated to such Committee or officers.
(b)
Appointment of Committees.
        
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate to one or more officers of the Company the power to grant Awards to employees or officers of the Company or any of its present or future subsidiary corporations and to exercise such other powers under the Plan as the Board may determine, provided that the Board shall fix the terms of the Awards to be granted by such officers (including the exercise price of such Awards, which may include a formula by which the exercise price will be determined) and the maximum number of shares subject to Awards that the officers may grant; provided further, however, that no officer shall be authorized to grant Awards to himself or herself or to any "executive officer" of the Company (as defined by Rule 3b-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) or to any "officer" of the Company (as defined by Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act).
(c)
Delegation to Officers.
         
4.
Available for Awards
             
 
Subject to adjustment under Section 9, Awards may be made under the Plan for up to 77,430,000 shares of common stock, $.0006 par value per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"). For purposes of counting the number of shares available for the grant of Awards under the Plan, (i) shares of Common Stock covered by independent SARs shall be counted against the number of shares available for the grant of Awards under the Plan; (ii) if any Award (A) expires or is terminated, surrendered or canceled without having been fully exercised or is forfeited in whole or in part (including as the result of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award being repurchased by the Company at the original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right) or (B) results in any Common Stock not being issued because the Award (other than a SAR) is settled for cash, the unused Common Stock covered by such Award (other than a SAR) shall again be available for the grant of Awards under the Plan; provided, however, in the case of Incentive Stock Options (as hereinafter defined), the foregoing shall be subject to any limitations under the Code; and (iii) shares of Common Stock tendered to the Company by a Participant to (A) purchase shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an Award or (B) satisfy tax withholding obligations (including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation) shall not be added back to the number of shares available for the future grant of Awards under the Plan.
(a)
Number of Shares.
         
 
In addition, if any option or restricted stock award granted under the 1992 Plan expires, is terminated, surrendered or canceled without having been fully exercised, is forfeited in whole or in part (including as the result of shares of Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award being repurchased by the Company at the original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right), then in each such case the unused Common Stock covered by such option or restricted stock award shall be available for the grant of Awards under the Plan, subject, however, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, to any limitations under the Code; and further provided that shares of Common Stock tendered to the Company to (A) purchase shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of any such option or (B) satisfy tax withholding obligations (including shares retained from the option or restricted stock award creating the tax obligation) shall not be added back to the number of shares available for the future grant of Awards under the Plan and that the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for grant of Awards pursuant to this sentence shall not exceed 51,000,000. Shares issued under the Plan may consist in whole or in part of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.
 
Subject to adjustment under Section 9, the following sub-limits on the number of shares of Common Stock subject to Awards shall apply:
(b)
Sub-limits.
        
 
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Awards may be granted to any Participant under the Plan in any calendar year shall be 3,450,000. The per-Participant limit described in this Section 4(b)(1) shall be construed and applied consistently with Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)").
(1)
Section 162(m) Per-Participant Limit.
         
 
The maximum number of shares with respect to which Awards other than Options and SARs may be granted shall be one-half of the total number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Plan (including any shares that may become available under this Plan pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) hereof).
(2)
Limit on Awards other than Options and SARs.
         
 
The maximum number of shares with respect to which Awards may be granted during the term of the Plan to directors who are not employees of the Company shall be 2,000,000 and the maximum number of shares of Common stock with respect to which Awards may be granted in any calendar year to any director who is not an employee of the Company shall be 150,000.
(3)
Limits on Awards to Directors.
         
 
5.
Stock Options
             
 
The Board may grant options to purchase Common Stock (each, an "Option") and determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Option, the exercise price of each Option and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of each Option, including conditions relating to applicable federal or state securities laws, as it considers necessary or advisable. An Option which is not intended to be an Incentive Stock Option (as hereinafter defined) shall be designated a "Nonstatutory Stock Option".
(a)
General.
         
An Option that the Board intends to be an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Code (an "Incentive Stock Option") shall only be granted to employees of Staples, Inc., any of Staples, Inc.'s present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code, and any other entities the employees of which are eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options under the Code, and shall be subject to and shall be construed consistently with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. The Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Option (or any part thereof) that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option is not an Incentive Stock Option.
(b)
Incentive Stock Options.
        
 
The Board shall establish the exercise price at the time each Option is granted and specify it in the applicable option agreement; provided, however, that the exercise price shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value (the "Fair Market Value") of the Common Stock, as determined by the Board, at the time the Option is granted.
(c)
Exercise Price.
         
 
Options granted under this Plan shall not contain any provision entitling the optionee to the automatic grant of additional Options in connection with any exercise of the original Option.
(d)
No Reload Rights.
        
 
Unless such action is approved by the Company's stockholders: (i) no outstanding Option granted under the Plan may be amended to provide an exercise price per share that is lower than the then-current exercise price per share of such outstanding Option (other than adjustments pursuant to Section 9), and (ii) the Board may not cancel any outstanding Option and grant in substitution therefor new Options under the Plan covering the same or a different number of shares of Common Stock and having an exercise price per share lower than the then-current exercise price per share of the cancelled Option.
(e)
No Repricing.
         
 
Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may specify in the applicable option agreement provided, however, that no Option will be granted for a term in excess of 10 years.
(f)
Duration of Options.
           
 
Options may be exercised by delivery to the Company of a written notice of exercise signed by the proper person or by any other form of notice (including electronic notice) approved by the Company, together with payment in full as specified in Section 5(h) for the number of shares for which the Option is exercised. Shares of Common Stock subject to the Option will be delivered by the Company following exercise either as soon as practicable or, to the extent permitted by the Company in its sole discretion, on a deferred basis in compliance with Section 409A of the Code (with the Company's obligation to be evidenced by an instrument providing for future delivery of the deferred shares at the time or times specified by the Board).
(g)
Exercise of Option.
        
 
Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of an Option granted under the Plan shall be paid for as follows:
(h)
Payment Upon Exercise.
        
 
in cash or by check, payable to the order of the Company;
(1)
         
 
except as the Board may, in its sole discretion, otherwise provide in an option agreement, by (i) delivery of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price and any required tax withholding or (ii) delivery by the Participant to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a creditworthy broker to promptly pay to the Company the exercise price and any required tax withholding;
(2)
         
 
if provided for in the option agreement or approved by the Company, in its sole discretion, by delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant valued at their Fair Market Value, provided (i) such method of payment is then permitted under applicable law, (ii) such Common Stock, if acquired directly from the Company was owned by the Participant for such minimum period of time, if any, as may be established by the Board in its discretion, and (iii) such Common Stock is not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements;
(3)
         
 
if provided for in the option agreement or approved by the Company, in its sole discretion, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may determine, but in no event may such consideration include delivery of a promissory note of the Participant to the Company; or
(4)
         
 
by any combination of the above permitted forms of payment.
(5)
         
In connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity with the Company or the acquisition by the Company of property or stock of an entity, the Board may grant Options in substitution for any options or other stock or stock-based awards granted by such entity or an affiliate thereof. Substitute Options may be granted pursuant to this Section 5(i) on such terms as the Board deems appropriate in the circumstances, notwithstanding any limitations on Options contained in the other sections of this Section 5 or in Section 2, so long as (a) the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to each substituted option immediately after the issuance of such substituted option over the aggregate exercise price of such option does not exceed the excess of the aggregate fair market value of all shares subject to the original option immediately before the issuance of such substituted option over the aggregate exercise price of the original option and (b) the ratio of the option exercise price to the fair market value of the stock for the substitute option is not greater than the ratio of the option exercise price to the fair market value of the original option immediately before such substitution.
(i)
Substitute Options.
            
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 10(f), the Board may amend an Option to convert it into a Stock Appreciation Right.
(j)
Amendment of Options.
            
 
6.
Stock Appreciation Rights
             
 
A Stock Appreciation Right, or SAR, is an Award entitling the holder on exercise to receive an amount in cash or Common Stock or a combination thereof (such form to be determined by the Board) determined solely by reference to appreciation, from and after the date of grant, in the fair market value of a share of Common Stock. The date as of which such appreciation or other measure is determined shall be the exercise date unless another date is specified by the Board.
(a)
Nature of Stock Appreciation Rights.
         
 
Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with, or independently of, Options granted under the Plan.
(b)
Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights.
        
 
When Stock Appreciation Rights are granted in tandem with Options, (a) the Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable only at such time or times, and to the extent, that the related Option is exercisable (except to the extent designated by the Board in connection with an Acquisition Event or a Change in Control Event) and will be exercisable in accordance with the procedure required for exercise of the related Option; (b) the Stock Appreciation Right will terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the related Option, except to the extent designated by the Board in connection with an Acquisition Event or a Change in Control Event and except that a Stock Appreciation Right granted with respect to less than the full number of shares covered by an Option will not be reduced until the number of shares as to which the related Option has been exercised or has terminated exceeds the number of shares not covered by the Stock Appreciation Right; (c) the Option will terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the exercise of the related Stock Appreciation Right; and (d) the Stock Appreciation Right will be transferable only with the related Option.
(1)
Rules Applicable to Tandem Awards.
         
 
A Stock Appreciation Right not granted in tandem with an Option will become exercisable at such time or times, and on such conditions, as the Board may specify. The Board may at any time accelerate the time at which all or any part of the Right may be exercised.
(2)
Exercise of Independent Stock Appreciation Rights.
         
 
Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised by delivery to the Company of a written notice of exercise signed by the proper person or by any other form of notice (including electronic notice) approved by the Company.
(c)
Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights.
         
 
7.
Restricted Stock; Restricted Stock Units
             
 
The Board may grant Awards entitling recipients to acquire shares of Common Stock ("Restricted Stock"), subject to the right of the Company to repurchase all or part of such shares at their issue price or other stated or formula price (or to require forfeiture of such shares if issued at no cost) from the recipient in the event that conditions specified by the Board in the applicable Award are not satisfied prior to the end of the applicable restriction period or periods established by the Board for such Award. Instead of granting
(a)
Grants.
         
Awards for Restricted Stock, the Board may grant Awards entitling the recipient to receive shares of Common Stock to be delivered in the future ("Restricted Stock Units") subject to such terms and conditions on the delivery of the shares of Common Stock as the Board shall determine (each Award for Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, a "Restricted Stock Award").
 
The Board shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Restricted Stock Award, including the conditions for repurchase (or forfeiture) and the issue price, if any.
(b)
Terms and Conditions.
        
 
Restricted Stock Awards that vest based on the passage of time alone shall be zero percent vested prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant, no more than 33% vested after the said first anniversary of the date of grant and before the second anniversary of the date of grant, and no more than 66% vested after the second anniversary of the date of grant and before the third anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted Stock Awards that vest based on performance alone shall not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted Stock Awards that vest upon the passage of time and provide for accelerated vesting based on performance shall not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date of grant. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 7(c)(1), the Board may grant Restricted Stock Awards that are not subject to any limitations on vesting with respect to up to 5% of the total number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Plan (excluding any shares that may become available under this Plan pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) hereof).
(c)
Limitations on Vesting.
         
1/3
2/3
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Board may, in its discretion, either at the time a Restricted Stock Award is made or at any time thereafter, waive its right to repurchase shares of Common Stock (or waive the forfeiture thereof) or remove or modify any part or all of the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Award, provided that the Board may only exercise such rights in extraordinary circumstances which shall include, without limitation, death or disability of the Participant; estate planning needs of the Participant; a merger, consolidation, sale, reorganization, recapitalization, or change in control of the Company; or any other nonrecurring significant event affecting the Company, a Participant or the Plan.
 
8.
Other Stock-Based Awards
             
 
Other Awards of shares of Common Stock and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, shares of Common Stock or other property, including without limitation rights to purchase shares of Common Stock ("Other Stock Unit Awards"), may be granted hereunder to Participants. Such Other Stock Unit Awards shall also be available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan or as payment in lieu of compensation to which a Participant is otherwise entitled. Other Stock Unit Awards may be paid in shares of Common Stock or cash, as the Board shall determine. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall determine the conditions of each Other Stock Unit Awards, including any purchase price applicable thereto; provided, however, that the limitations on vesting and exceptions thereto contained in Section 7(c)(1) of the Plan shall also apply to all Other Stock Unit Awards.
 
9.
Adjustments for Changes in Common Stock and Certain Other Events
             
 
In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, (i) the number and class of securities available under this Plan, (ii) the sub-limits set forth in Section 4(b), (iii) the number and class of securities and exercise price per share subject to each outstanding Option, (iv) the repurchase price per share subject to each outstanding Restricted Stock Award and (v) the terms of each other outstanding stock-based Award shall be adjusted by the Company in the same proportion (or substituted Awards may be made, if applicable). If this Section 9(a) applies and Section 9(c) also applies to any event, Section 9(c) shall be applicable to such event, and this Section 9(a) shall not be applicable.
(a)
Changes in Capitalization.
         
 
In the event of a proposed liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Board shall upon written notice to the Participants provide that all then unexercised Options will (i) become exercisable in full as of a specified time at least 10 business days prior to the effective date of such liquidation or dissolution and (ii) terminate effective upon such liquidation or dissolution, except to the extent exercised before
(b)
Liquidation or Dissolution.
        
such effective date. The Board may specify the effect of a liquidation or dissolution on any Restricted Stock Award granted under the Plan at the time of the grant.
 
(c)
Reorganization Events.
         
 
A "Reorganization Event" shall mean: (a) any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity as a result of which all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other property or (b) any exchange of all of the Common Stock for cash, securities or other property pursuant to a share exchange transaction.
(1)
Definition.
         
 
In connection with a Reorganization Event, the Board shall take any one or more of the following actions as to all or any outstanding Awards on such terms as the Board determines: (i) provide that Awards shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent Awards shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, provide that the Participant's unexercised Options or other unexercised Awards shall become exercisable in full and will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such Reorganization Event unless exercised by the Participant within a specified period following the date of such notice, (iii) in the event of a Reorganization Event under the terms of which holders of Common Stock will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the Reorganization Event (the "Acquisition Price"), make or provide for a cash payment to a Participant equal to (A) the Acquisition Price times the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Participant's Options or other Awards (to the extent the exercise price does not exceed the Acquisition Price) minus (B) the aggregate exercise price of all such outstanding Options or other Awards, in exchange for the termination of such Options or other Awards, (iv) provide that outstanding Awards shall become exercisable or realizable, or restrictions applicable to a Restricted Stock Award or other Award shall lapse, in whole or in part, prior to or upon such Reorganization Event, (v) provide that, in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, Awards shall convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds (if applicable, net of the exercise price thereof) and (vi) any combination of the foregoing. To the extent all or any portion of an Award becomes exercisable solely as a result of clause (ii) above, the Board may provide that upon exercise of such Award the Participant shall receive shares subject to a right of repurchase by the Company or its successor at the Award exercise price; such repurchase right (A) shall lapse at the same rate as the Award would have become exercisable under its terms and (B) shall not apply to any shares subject to the Award that were exercisable under its terms without regard to clause (ii) above.
(2)
Consequences of a Reorganization Event on Awards.
         
 
10.
General Provisions Applicable to Awards
      
 
Awards shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the person to whom they are granted, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, other than in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the life of the Participant, shall be exercisable only by the Participant; provided, however, that the Board may permit or provide in an Award for the gratuitous transfer of the Award by the Participant to or for the benefit of any immediate family member, family trust or family partnership established solely for the benefit of the Participant and/or an immediate family member thereof if, with respect to such proposed transferee, the Company would be eligible to use a Form S-8 for the registration of the sale of the Common Stock subject to such Award under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to recognize any such transfer until such time as the Participant and such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Company confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Award. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in the context, shall include references to authorized transferees.
(a)
Transferability of Awards.
         
 
Each Award shall be evidenced in such form (written, electronic or otherwise) as the Board shall determine. Each Award may contain terms and conditions in addition to those set forth in the Plan.
(b)
Documentation.
        
Except as otherwise provided by the Plan, each Award may be made alone or in addition or in relation to any other Award. The terms of each Award need not be identical, and the Board need not treat Participants uniformly.
(c)
Board Discretion.
         
 
The Board shall determine the effect on an Award of the disability, death, retirement, authorized leave of absence or other change in the employment or other status of a Participant and the extent to which, and the period during which, the Participant, the Participant's legal representative, conservator or guardian may exercise rights under the Award.
(d)
Termination of Status.
        
 
The Company may require each Participant to pay to the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of, an amount sufficient to pay any taxes, social security contributions, or other similar amounts required by law to be withheld in connection with an Award to such Participant. If provided for in an Award or approved by the Company, in its sole discretion, a Participant may satisfy such tax obligations in whole or in part by delivery of shares of Common Stock, including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value; provided, however, that except as otherwise provided by the Board, the total tax withholding where stock is being used to satisfy such tax obligations cannot exceed the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligations (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income). Shares surrendered to satisfy tax withholding requirements cannot be subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements. The Company may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to a Participant.
(e)
Withholding.
         
 
Except as prohibited by Section 5(e), the Board may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including but not limited to, substituting therefor another Award of the same or a different type, changing the date of exercise or realization, converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonstatutory Stock Option and converting an Option into a SAR, provided that, in each such case, the Participant's consent to such action shall be required unless the Board determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not materially and adversely affect the Participant.
(f)
Amendment of Award.
           
 
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan or to remove restrictions from shares previously delivered under the Plan until (i) all conditions of the Award have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the Company, (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities laws and any applicable stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may consider appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
(g)
Conditions on Delivery of Stock.
        
 
The Board may at any time provide that any Award shall become immediately exercisable in full or in part, free of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise realizable in full or in part, as the case may be; provided, however, that this sentence shall apply to a Restricted Stock Award only to the extent consistent with Sections 7(c)(2) and 10(j).
(h)
Acceleration.
        
 
The Board may provide in an Award or in an amendment to an Award that the Participant may elect to defer the delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be delivered pursuant to such Award. The Board may establish such conditions on the Participant's election as it deems appropriate, including provisions to obtain compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
(i)
Deferral.
            
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if the Committee determines at the time a Restricted Stock Award or an Other Stock Unit Award is granted to a Participant who is then an officer, that such Participant is, or is likely to be as of the end of the tax year in which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Award, a Covered Employee (as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code), then the Committee may provide that this Section 10(j) is applicable to such Award.
(j)
Performance Conditions.
            
 
If a Restricted Stock Award or an Other Stock Unit Award is subject to this Section 10(j), then the lapsing of restrictions thereon and the distribution of Shares pursuant thereto, as applicable, shall be subject to the achievement of one or more objective performance goals established by the Committee, which shall be based on one or more of the
following measures: sales, earnings per share, return on net assets, return on equity, and customer service levels. The Committee may determine that special one-time or extraordinary gains and/or losses and/or other one-time or extraordinary events should or should not be included or considered in the calculation of such measures. In addition, customer service target levels will be based on predetermined tests of customer service levels such as scores on blind test ("mystery") shopping, customer comment card statistics, customer relations statistics (e.g., number of customer complaints), and delivery response levels. The Committee believes that disclosure of further detail concerning the performance criteria may be confidential commercial or business information, the disclosure of which would adversely affect the Company. Such performance goals may vary by Participant and may be different for different Awards. Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder.
 
The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Section 10(j) as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto.
 
11.
Miscellaneous
      
 
No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to continued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with a Participant free from any liability or claim under the Plan, except as expressly provided in the applicable Award.
(a)
No Right To Employment or Other Status.
         
 
Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award, no Participant shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be distributed with respect to an Award until becoming the record holder of such shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company effects a split of the Common Stock by means of a stock dividend and the exercise price of and the number of shares subject to such Option are adjusted as of the date of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such dividend), then an optionee who exercises an Option between the record date and the distribution date for such stock dividend shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock dividend with respect to the shares of Common Stock acquired upon such Option exercise, notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date for such stock dividend.
(b)
No Rights As Stockholder.
        
 
The Plan shall become effective on the date on which it is approved by stockholders of the Company and shall remain in full force and effect until terminated by the Board. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after the completion of ten years from the date on which the Plan is adopted or was approved by the Company's stockholders, whichever is earlier, but Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date.
(c)
Effective Date and Term of Plan.
         
 
The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time, provided that no amendment requiring the approval of the Company's stockholders under any applicable tax requirement, including without limitation Sections 162(m) and 422 of the Code, shall become effective until such approval of the Company's stockholders is obtained and provided further that without approval of the Company's stockholders, no amendment may (i) increase the number of shares authorized under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section 9), (ii) materially increase the benefits provided under the Plan, (iii) materially expand the class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan, (iv) expand the types of Awards provided under the Plan or (v) make any other changes which require stockholder approval under the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, Inc. No Award shall be made that is conditioned on the approval of the Company's stockholders of any amendment to the Plan.
(d)
Amendment of Plan.
        
 
The Board may modify the terms and conditions of Awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, establish subplans under the Plan, or adopt such modifications or procedures as the Board may determine to be necessary or advisable to recognize differences in laws, rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit, accounting or other matters.
(e)
Provisions for Foreign Participants.
         
No Award shall provide for deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, unless the Board, at the time of grant, specifically provides that the Award is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(f)
Compliance With Code Section 409A.
           
 
The provisions of the Plan and all Awards made hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law.
(g)
Governing Law.
