Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Amendment to Bridge Agreement
 
On July 1, 2008, Staples, Inc. ("Staples") entered into the first amendment (the "Amendment") to the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 1, 2008, by and among Staples, the lenders named therein, Lehman Brothers Commercial Paper Inc., as administrative agent for the lenders, and Bank of America, N.A. and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as co-syndication agents for the Lenders (the "Bridge Agreement").  The Amendment updates the Bridge Agreement to provide that certain events, including the Agreement (defined below) and maintaining certain obligations of Corporate Express N.V. after the Acquisition (defined below), will not reduce the maximum commitment available under the Bridge Agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the Amendment and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
New Credit Facility
 
On July 1, 2008, Staples as borrower entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with the lenders named therein (the "Lenders"), Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and HSC Bank USA, National Association, as co-syndication agents, and Lehman Brothers Inc, Banc of America Securities LLC and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.
 
The Agreement provides for borrowing of a maximum principal amount of up to $400,000,000 to be drawn on or before the closing date, which will not be later than July 11, 2008. The new credit facility may be used by Staples for working capital of Staples and its subsidiaries and in connection with the acquisition of Corporate Express N.V. (the "Acquisition"), including the repayment of Corporate Express' indebtedness, and closing of the credit facility is contingent on certain customary closing conditions.
 
Amounts borrowed under the Agreement once borrowed may not be reborrowed. Outstanding loans under the Agreement may be prepaid without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date, November 28, 2008, except that any full or partial repayment of loans bearing interest under the Eurocurrency rate may only be made on the last day of the relevant interest period or Staples must pay the cost and expense incurred by the Lenders as a result of the timing of the repayment.  Borrowings made pursuant to the Agreement will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at either (a) the base rate (the higher of the prime rate, as defined in the Agreement, or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus an "applicable margin", defined as a percentage spread based on Staples' credit rating or (b) the Eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate) plus an applicable margin.  The payments under this Agreement are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries of Staples that guarantee Staples' publicly issued notes, its existing revolving credit facility and the $3 billion Bridge Agreement entered into in connection with the Acquisition.
 
The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants which are substantially the same as those in the Bridge Agreement and provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, which also follow those in the Bridge Agreement.
 
In the event of a default by Staples, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders will, declare all obligations under the Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the Agreement, and enforce any and all rights
of the Lenders or Administrative Agent under the Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of Staples will become immediately due and payable.
 
Under the Agreement, Staples agrees to pay a duration fee equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of each Lender's loans outstanding on the date 90 days after the closing date.
 
Certain of the Lenders party to the Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for Staples and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

THE CREDIT FACILITY.
 
. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Credit Agreement, each of the Lenders severally agrees to make Loans to the Borrower on the Closing Date (or as otherwise contemplated by the last sentence of 9.2 hereof) in Dollars and in such amounts as are requested by the Borrower, that (i) the principal amount of the Loan made by each Lender shall not at any time exceed such Lender's Commitment Amount and (ii) (after giving effect to all amounts requested) the outstanding Loans shall not exceed the Total Commitment. Any portion of the Commitment Amounts not drawn on the Closing Date will terminate automatically. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, only one drawdown of Loans shall be permitted under this Credit Agreement (subject to the last sentence of 9.2 hereof).
2.1.

. The Borrower shall give to the Administrative Agent written notice in the form of hereto (or telephonic notice confirmed in a writing in the form of hereto) of each Loan requested hereunder (a " ") not later than (a) 12:00 noon (New York time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Base Rate Loan and (b) 12:00 noon (New York time) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed Drawdown Date of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan. Each such notice shall specify (i) the principal amount of the Loan requested, (ii) the proposed Drawdown Date of such Loan, (iii) with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the

initial Interest Period relating thereto and (iv) the Type of such Loan. Promptly upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Lenders thereof. Each Loan Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and shall obligate the Borrower to accept the Loan requested from the Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Loan Request shall be (A) in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof with respect to Base Rate Loans and (B) in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $l,000,000 with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Loans.

Funds for Loans
 
. Each of the relevant Lenders will make available to the Administrative Agent, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose to the Lenders, in Same Day Funds, the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of the requested Loans not later than 1:30 p.m. (New York time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Loans. Upon receipt from each Lender of such amount, and upon receipt of the documents required by 9 hereof and the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent applicable, the Administrative Agent will make available to the Borrower the aggregate amount of such Loans made available to the Administrative Agent by the relevant Lenders. The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent its Commitment Percentage of the requested Loans on any Drawdown Date shall not excuse any other Lender from making available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such other Lender's Commitment Percentage of any requested Loans.

2.3.2.
         
Advances by Administrative Agent
 
The Administrative Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by any Lender prior to a Drawdown Date, assume that such Lender has made available to the Administrative Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date, and the Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (a) the average computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of the Overnight Rate for each day included in such period, times (b) the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Loans, times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Drawdown Date to the date on which the amount of such Lender's Loans shall become immediately available to the Administrative Agent, and the denominator of which is 360. A statement of the Administrative Agent submitted to such Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this 2.3.2 shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing to the Administrative Agent by such Lender. If the amount of such Lender's Loans is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days
(a)
                                
following such Drawdown Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from the Borrower on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Loans made on such Drawdown Date and the Borrower may take the actions permitted under 3.12 hereof to replace such Lender. Any payment by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent of any Loans pursuant to this 2.3.2 shall be deemed to be a payment of the Loans that were to be made by the Lender that failed to make such Loans.
 
(b)
                               
Unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to such Lender. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in Same Day Funds, then each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under 2.3.2(a) and (b) hereof shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c)
                                
 
. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent to reduce by $5,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof or terminate entirely the Total Commitment, whereupon the Commitment Amount of each Lender shall be reduced in accordance with its Commitment Percentage by the amount specified in such notice or, as the case may be, terminated. Promptly after receiving any notice of the Borrower delivered pursuant to this 2.4, the Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of the substance thereof. No reduction or termination of the Total Commitment may be reinstated.
2.4.
                   
Reduction of Total Commitment

Unless previously terminated, the Total Commitment shall terminate entirely and automatically at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the earlier of (a) the Closing Date and (b) July 11, 2008 (if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or prior to such date).
 
. The Borrower promises to pay on the Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the Maturity Date, all of the Loans outstanding to the Borrower on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

. The Borrower shall have the right, at its election, to repay the outstanding amount of the Loans, as a whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium, that any full or partial repayment of the outstanding amount of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans pursuant to this 2.7 may be made only on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto unless the Borrower pays each Lender, in accordance with 3.10 hereof, the costs and expenses incurred by such Lender as a result of the repayment of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent, prior written notice no later than 1:00 p.m., (New York time), on the date of any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Base Rate Loans and no later than 1:00 p.m., (New York time), three (3) Business Days' prior to any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in each case specifying the proposed date of repayment of such Loans and the principal amount to be prepaid. Each such partial repayment of the Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and shall be applied, in the absence of instruction by the Borrower, first to the principal of Base Rate Loans and then to the principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Each partial repayment of Loans shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by each Lender being prepaid. Loans, once prepaid, may not be reborrowed.

Conversion to Different Type of Loan
that (a) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at least one (1) Business Day's prior written notice of such election; (b) with respect to any such conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of such election; (c) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan, such conversion shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period with respect to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan; and (d) no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. On the date on which such conversion is being made each Lender shall take such action as is necessary to transfer its Commitment Percentage of such Loans to its Lending Office for domestic loans or its Lending Office for Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as the case may be. All or any part of outstanding Loans of any Type may be converted into a Loan of another Type as provided herein, that any partial conversion shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Loan to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be irrevocable by the Borrower.

. Any Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued as a Eurocurrency Rate Loan upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in 2.9.1 hereof; that no Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default of which officers of the Administrative Agent active upon the Borrower's account have actual knowledge. In the event that the Borrower fails to provide any such notice with respect to continuation of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan as such, than such Eurocurrency Rate shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders and the Borrower promptly when any such automatic conversion contemplated by this 2.9.2 is scheduled to occur.
2.9.2.
         
Continuation of Type of Loan

The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect

The Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, upon demand by such Lender, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this 3.6, including any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurocurrency Rate Loans hereunder.

to require such Lender or the Administrative Agent to make any payment or to forego any interest or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment or foregone interest or other sum is calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by such Lender or the Administrative Agent from the Borrower hereunder,
(iii)
                             
 
then, in each such case and to the extent that the amount of such additional cost, reduction, payment, foregone interest or other sum is not reflected in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, the Borrower will, upon demand made by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion therefor may arise, pay to such Lender or the Administrative Agent such additional amounts as will be sufficient to compensate such Lender or the Administrative Agent for such additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or other sum (without duplication for recovery of such amounts under any other provision hereof), that the Borrower shall not be liable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent for costs incurred more than sixty (60) days prior to receipt by the Borrower of such demand for payment from such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent unless such costs were incurred prior to such 60-day period solely as a result of such present or future applicable law being retroactive to a date which occurred prior to such 60-day period.
provided
 
.  If after the Effective Date any Lender or the Administrative Agent determines that the adoption of or change in any law, governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by a Governmental Authority with appropriate jurisdiction has the effect of reducing the return on such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's commitment with respect to any Loans to a level below that which such Lender or the Administrative Agent could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming full utilization of such entity's capital) by any amount deemed by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent to be material, then such Lender or the Administrative Agent may notify the Borrower of such fact.

WHEREAS

WHEREAS
 
, the Guarantors wish to guaranty the Borrower's obligations to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under or in respect of the Credit Agreement as provided herein:
WHEREAS

NOW THEREFORE
 
The term "Obligations" and all other capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings provided therefor in the Credit Agreement.
1. .
Definitions
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent the full and punctual payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by required pre-payment, by acceleration or otherwise), as well as the performance, of all of the Obligations including all such which would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to 362(a) of Title 11, United States Code (the "") and the operation of 502(b) and 506(b) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. This Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance of all of the Obligations and not of their collectibility

Guaranty of Payment and Performance

only and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender first attempt to collect any of the Obligations from the Borrower or resort to any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment. Should the Borrower default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder with respect to such Obligations in default shall, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, become immediately due and payable to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, without demand or notice of any nature, all of which are expressly waived by each of the Guarantors. Payments by the Guarantors hereunder may be required by the Administrative Agent on any number of occasions. All payments by the Guarantors hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, in the manner and at the place of payment specified therefor in the Credit Agreement, for the account of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under 548 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law.
 
Each of the Guarantors further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs and legal expenses) incurred or expended by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the Obligations, this Guaranty and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this 3 from the time when such amounts become due until payment, whether before or after judgment, at the rate of interest for overdue principal set forth in the Credit Agreement, that if such interest exceeds the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such interest shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount.
3. .
Guarantors' Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs
provided
 
The Guarantors agree that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. Each of the Guarantors waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Borrower or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Guarantors agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation and agrees that the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other
4. .
Waivers by Guarantors; Lender's Freedom to Act
agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations, (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (v) the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of such Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to such Guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any "one action" or "anti-deficiency" law which would otherwise prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against such Guarantor before or after the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
 
If for any reason the Borrower has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable from the Borrower by reason of the Borrower's insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on each of the Guarantors to the same extent as if such Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Obligations. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantors.
5. .
Unenforceability of Obligations Against Borrower
 
6. .
Subrogation; Subordination
 
. Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations, the Guarantors shall not exercise and hereby waive any rights against the Borrower arising as a result of payment by the Guarantors hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not prove any claim in competition with the Administrative Agent or any Lender in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantors will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against the Borrower in respect of any liability of the Guarantors to the Borrower; and the Guarantors waive any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and
6.1.
                   
Waiver of Rights Against Borrower
the Administrative Agent, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantors under the other provisions of this Guaranty.
 
The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of the Borrower for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantors is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Obligations. Each of the Guarantors agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, such Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of the Borrower to such Guarantor until all of the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantors shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantors under the other provisions of this Guaranty.
6.2.
.
                   
Subordination
 
The provisions of this 6 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under any separate subordination agreement which the Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time enter into with the Guarantors for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent.
6.3.
.
                   
Provisions Supplemental
 
. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral, during the continuance of any Event of Default, any deposits or other sums credited by or due from the Administrative Agent, any of the Lenders or any of the Subsidiaries of the holding company owning the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Guarantor and any securities or other property of such Guarantor in the possession of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Subsidiary of the holding company owning the Administrative Agent may be applied to or set off by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Subsidiary of the holding company owning the Administrative Agent or such Lender against the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under this Guaranty.
7.
Setoff
 
To the extent any of the Guarantors makes a payment hereunder in excess of the aggregate amount of the benefit received by such Person in respect of the extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement (the "Benefit Amount"), then such Person, after the payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations shall be entitled to recover from each such Person such excess payment, pro rata in accordance with the ratio of the Benefit Amount received by such other Person to the total Benefit Amounts received by each of the Guarantors, and the right to such recovery shall be deemed to be an asset and property of such Person so funding; that all such rights to recovery shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the final and indefeasible repayment in full in cash of all of the Obligations.
8. .
Contribution
provided
 
Each of the Guarantors agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of the Administrative Agent, do all such things and execute all such documents as the Administrative Agent may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Guaranty and
9. .
Further Assurances
to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereunder. Each of the Guarantors acknowledges and confirms that such Guarantor itself has established its own adequate means of obtaining from the Borrower on a continuing basis all information desired by such Guarantor concerning the financial condition of the Borrower and that such Guarantor will look to the Borrower and not to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for such Guarantor to keep adequately informed of changes in the Borrower's financial condition.
 
This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect until the Administrative Agent is given written notice of the Guarantors' intention to discontinue this Guaranty, notwithstanding any intermediate or temporary payment or settlement of the whole or any part of the Obligations. No such notice shall be effective unless received and acknowledged by an officer of the Administrative Agent, on behalf of all of the Lenders, at the address of the Administrative Agent for notices set forth in 19 of the Credit Agreement. No such notice shall affect any rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, including without limitation the rights set forth in 4 and 6 hereof, with respect to any Obligations incurred or accrued prior to the receipt of such notice or any Obligations incurred or accrued pursuant to any contract or commitment in existence prior to such receipt. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, notwithstanding any such notice, if at any time any payment made or value received with respect to any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made or value received.
10. .
Termination; Reinstatement
 
This Guaranty shall be binding upon each of the Guarantors, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, each Lender may assign or otherwise transfer the Credit Agreement, its Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement or note held by it evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to such Lender herein, all in accordance with 18 of the Credit Agreement. The Guarantors may not assign any of their obligations hereunder.
11. .
Successors and Assigns
 
No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty nor consent to any departure by the Guarantors therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent with the consent of all of the Lenders. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
12. .
Amendments and Waivers
 
All notices and other communications called for hereunder shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly made or given when delivered by hand or mailed first class, postage prepaid, or, in the case

Each of the Guarantors agrees that any suit for the enforcement of this Guaranty may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or any federal court sitting therein and consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such court and to service of process in any such suit being made upon such Guarantor by mail at the address specified by reference in 13 hereof. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit was brought in an inconvenient court.
14.
Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction
THE GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (EXCLUDING THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO CONFLICTS OR CHOICE OF LAW)
 
. . Except as prohibited by law, each of the Guarantors hereby waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to, actual damages. Each of the Guarantors (a) certifies that neither the Administrative Agent or any Lender nor any representative, agent or attorney of the Administrative Agent or any Lender has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the Administrative Agent or any Lender would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and (b) acknowledges that, in entering into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent or any Lender is a party, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and certifications contained in this 15.

The Preference Shares tendered in the Offer represent 99.7 percent of the total issued and outstanding preference shares A in the capital of Corporate Express N.V.
 
 
 
 
Together with the EUR 6,733,550 principal amount of Bonds already held by Staples Acquisition B.V., the Bonds tendered in the Offer represent 99.1 percent of the total issued and outstanding principal amount of the Bonds convertible into Ordinary Shares in the capital of Corporate Express N.V.

In accordance with the terms of the Offer, payment of the offer price of EUR 9.25 in cash per Ordinary Share validly tendered (or defectively tendered, provided that such defect has been waived by Staples Acquisition B.V.) and validly delivered to the Dutch Settlement Agent is expected to take place on July 9, 2008.
 
In accordance with the terms of the Offer, payment of the offer price of EUR 9.25 in cash per ADS validly tendered (or defectively tendered, provided that such defect has been waived by Staples Acquisition B.V.) and validly delivered to the U.S. Settlement Agent is expected to take place on July 9, 2008.

The payment of the offer price of EUR 1,346.71 in cash per Bond validly tendered (or defectively tendered, provided that such defect has been waived by Staples Acquisition B.V.) and validly delivered to the Dutch Settlement Agent is expected to take place on July 9, 2008.

Staples Acquisition B.V. grants Corporate Express' securityholders who have not yet tendered their securities under the Offer the opportunity to tender their securities in a post acceptance period (). The post acceptance period commences at 9:00 hours, CET (3:00 hours EDT), on July 3, 2008 and expires at 17:30 hours CET (11:30 hours EDT), on July 16, 2008 (the "Post Acceptance Period"). Corporate Express' securityholders can tender their securities in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as described in the Offer Memorandum of May 19, 2008, subject to the amendments in the press announcements of June 3, 11 and 25, 2008.

Offer Memorandum and Further Information
 
Digital copies of the Offer Memorandum are available on the Staples' U.S. website (). Staples' U.S. website does not constitute a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, the Offer Memorandum. Copies of the Offer Memorandum are also available through Georgeson, the Information Agent, ING Bank N.V., the Dutch Settlement Agent, and Mellon Investor Services LLC, the U.S. Settlement Agent. The contact details for the agents are as follows:

During the Post Acceptance Period, Corporate Express' securityholders who hold their securities through an admitted institution of Euronext Amsterdam N.V. and/or NYSE are requested to make their acceptance known via their custodian, bank or stockbroker.
 
Delisting
 
Staples and Corporate Express intend to terminate the listing of Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares on Euronext Amsterdam and the listing of ADS's on the NYSE as soon as possible after settlement. This would adversely affect the liquidity of any securities not tendered in the Offer. Corporate Express intends to make a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requesting termination of the registration of the Ordinary Shares and the ADS's under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which may result in the termination of Corporate Express' reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. Corporate Express N.V. further intends to terminate the deposit agreement relating to the ADS's.
 
Corporate Express securityholders who do not wish to tender their securities in the Post Acceptance Period should carefully review Section 5.17 of the Offer Memorandum.
 
Restrictions
 
The Offer is not being made, and the securities will not be accepted for purchase from or on behalf of any securityholders, in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities or other laws or regulations of such jurisdiction or would require any registration, approval or filing with any regulatory authority not expressly contemplated by the terms of the Offer Memorandum. However, acceptances of the Offer by securityholders not residing in The Netherlands will be accepted by Staples Acquisition B.V. if such acceptances comply with the acceptance procedure set out in the Offer Memorandum. Persons obtaining the Offer Memorandum are required to take due notice and observe all such restrictions and obtain any necessary authorisations,
 
 
 
 
approvals or consents. None of Staples Acquisition B.V., Staples, Inc., any of their respective affiliates or any director, employee or advisor of any of the foregoing accepts any liability for any violation by any person of any such restriction. Any person (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) who would or otherwise intends to forward the Offer Memorandum or any related document to any jurisdiction outside The Netherlands should carefully read Section 1 (Restrictions and Important Information) in the Offer Memorandum before taking any such action. The distribution of the Offer Memorandum in jurisdictions other than The Netherlands may be restricted by law and therefore persons into whose possession the Offer Memorandum comes should inform themselves about and observe such restrictions. Any failure to comply with any such restrictions may constitute a violation of the law of any such jurisdiction.
 
Canada and Japan
 
The Offer and any solicitation in respect thereof is not being made, directly or indirectly, in or into Canada or Japan, or by use of the mails, or by any means or instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce, or any facilities of a national securities exchange, of Canada or Japan. This includes, but is not limited to, post, facsimile transmission, telex or any other electronic form of transmission and telephone. Accordingly, copies of the Offer Memorandum and any related press announcements, acceptance forms and other documents are not being sent and must not be mailed or otherwise distributed or sent in, into or from Canada or Japan or, in their capacities as such, to custodians, nominees or trustees holding securities for persons residing in Canada or Japan. Persons receiving the Offer Memorandum and/or such other documents must not distribute or send them in, into or from Canada or Japan, or use such mails or any such means, instrumentalities or facilities for any purpose in connection with the Offer; so doing will invalidate any purported acceptance of the Offer. None of Staples Acquisition B.V., Staples, Inc. or any of their respective affiliates will accept any tender by any such use, means, instrumentalities or facilities from within Canada or Japan.
 
United States
 
The Offer is being made for the securities of a Dutch company and, while the Offer is subject to Dutch and certain applicable U.S. disclosure requirements, U.S. securityholders should be aware that the Offer Memorandum has been prepared in accordance with Dutch format and style, which differs from U.S. format and style. In addition, the consolidated financial information of Corporate Express included or referred to herein has been prepared on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (as defined in Section 3 (Definitions) in the Offer Memorandum) and, accordingly, may not be comparable to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
