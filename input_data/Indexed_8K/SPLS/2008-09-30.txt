On September 25, 2008, Barclays entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. ("Lehman CPI") to assume all of the outstanding rights and obligations of Lehman CPI as lender under Staples' $3 billion credit agreement, dated as of April 1, 2008, as amended as of July 1, 2008, with Lehman CPI as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and HSBC Bank USA, National Association as co-syndication agents, and Lehman Brothers Inc. as lead arranger and bookrunner (the "2008 Agreement").  The 2008 Agreement provided financing for Staples' acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Corporate Express, including related transaction fees, costs and expenses, by permitting direct advances and/or backstopping the Program (as defined below under Item 8.01).  Amounts borrowed under the 2008 Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount of the loans outstanding not to exceed the maximum borrowing amount of $3 billion.  Barclays is also assuming all of the outstanding rights and obligations of Lehman CPI as lender under Staples' $750 million amended and restated revolving credit agreement, dated as of October 13, 2006, as amended, and of Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank as lender under Staples' $400 million term loan, dated as of July 1, 2008.
 
The parties to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and their respective affiliates have performed, and some may in the future perform, for Staples and its subsidiaries various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and may receive, customary fees and expenses.
