On March 27, 2009, Staples, Inc. ("Staples") issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.750% senior notes due 2011 (the "Notes"), in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-155855) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated March 24, 2009 with Barclays Capital Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement. Staples received net proceeds, after underwriting fees and estimated expenses, of approximately $497.5 million.
 
The Notes were issued under an Indenture dated as of January 15, 2009 (the "Indenture") among Staples, the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as trustee.
 
Staples' obligations under the Notes and the Indenture are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured unsubordinated basis by Staples the Office Superstore, LLC, Staples the Office Superstore East, Inc., Staples Contract & Commercial, Inc. and Staples the Office Superstore, Limited Partnership (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors").
 
The Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture have been previously filed. The form of Note is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto.
 
In connection with the receipt of proceeds from the offering of the Notes described above, the total commitment amount under Staples' existing Credit Agreement, dated April 1, 2008 (the "Credit Agreement"), was reduced from $1,261 million to $761 million. As a result of the change, availability under Staples' commercial paper program was reduced from $2.0 billion to approximately $1.5 billion. The commercial paper program is backstopped by the Credit Agreement and Staples' existing $750 million revolving credit facility entered into in October 2006.

STAPLES, INC.
 
7.750% Senior Notes Due April 1, 2011
 
CUSIP NO. 855030AK8
 
 
Staples, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of                                              Dollars (which principal amount may from time to time be increased or decreased to such other principal amounts by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee hereinafter referred to in accordance with the Indenture) on April 1, 2011, and, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided, to pay interest thereon from March 27, 2009 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 in each year commencing October 1, 2009 at the rate of 7.750% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable at the interest rate then in effect on any overdue principal and on any overdue installment of interest until paid.
 
 
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the March 15 or September 15 (regardless of whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.  If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, it shall be postponed to the following Business Day.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.  Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Trustee or any Paying Agent maintained for that purpose in the City of New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; , that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.
provided, however
 
Interest Rate Adjustment
 
The interest rate payable on this series of Securities will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below)) or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P") (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the rating assigned to this series of Securities, as set forth below.
 
If the rating with respect to this series of Securities from Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this series of Securities will increase from the interest rate payable on this series of Securities set forth on the face of this Security by the percentage points set forth below opposite that rating.
 
 
 
*  Including the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency.
 
If the rating with respect to this series of Securities from S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency thereof is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on this series of Securities will increase from the interest rate payable on this series of Securities on the date set forth on the face of this Security by the percentage points set forth below opposite that rating.
 
 
*  Including the equivalent rating of any Substitute Rating Agency.
 
If at any time the interest rate on this series of Securities has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by an Interest Rate Rating Agency and that Interest Rate Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating on this series of Securities to any of the ratings set forth in the tables above, the per annum interest rate on this series of Securities will be decreased such that the per annum interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the percentage points set forth opposite the ratings in effect immediately following the increase in the tables above; if Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating on this series of Securities to "Baa3" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating on this series of Securities to "BBB-" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the per annum interest rate on this series of Securities will be decreased to the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
provided, however, that
 
No adjustment in the interest rate on this series of Securities shall be made solely as a result of an Interest Rate Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Interest Rate Rating Agencies provide a rating on this series of Securities, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating on this series of Securities from another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates this series of Securities (such organization, as certified by a resolution of the Company's board of directors, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the per annum interest rate on this series of Securities pursuant to the tables above, (1) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Interest Rate Rating Agency to provide a rating on this series of Securities but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (2) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating
 
 
Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's and S&P in such tables, and (3) the per annum interest rate on this series of Securities will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (2) above) (plus any applicable percentage points resulting from a decreased rating by the other Interest Rate Rating Agency).  For so long as (a) only one Interest Rate Rating Agency provides a rating on this series of Securities, any increase or decrease in the interest rate on this series of Securities necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by that Interest Rate Rating Agency shall be twice the applicable percentage set forth in the applicable table above and (b) no Interest Rate Rating Agency provides a rating on this series of Securities, the interest rate on this series of Securities will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security. If Moody's or S&P ceases to rate this series of Securities or make a rating of this series of Securities publicly available for reasons within the Company's control, the Company will not be entitled to obtain a rating from a Substitute Rating Agency and the increase or decrease in the per annum interest rate on this series of Securities shall be determined in the manner described above as if either only one or no Interest Rate Rating Agency provides a rating on this series of Securities, as the case may be.
 
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the per annum interest rate on this series of Securities be reduced below the interest rate as set forth on the face of this Security or (2) the per annum interest rate on this series of Securities exceed 2.00% above the interest rate set forth on the face of this Security.
 
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next business day after the rating change has occurred.  The Company shall promptly advise the Trustee of each change in interest rate, change in rating or the appointment and identity of any Substitute Rating Agency by Company Notice.  The Trustee shall not be responsible for determining the interest rate that may be in effect from time to time.
 
The interest rates on this series of Securities will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Interest Rate Rating Agency) if this series of Securities becomes rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) and "A-" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if this series of Securities are rated by only one Interest Rate Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
 
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 7.750% Senior Notes due 2011 (herein called the "Securities"), limited initially (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture referred to below) in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000, issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of January 15, 2009 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors named therein, and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture).

The Company may not issue Additional Securities if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Securities.

In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Security (including upon an exchange, transfer, redemption or repurchase of this Security in part only) effected in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, the Security Registrar, upon receipt of notice of such event from the Depositary's custodian for this Security, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect an increase or decrease of the Outstanding principal amount of this Security resulting from such deposit or withdrawal, as the case may be.
 
The Securities of this series are redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time, on not less than 30 or more than 60 days' prior notice mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts:

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on this series of Securities being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of such payments representing interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer,
                 
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
 
 
For purposes of the foregoing provisions regarding the Company's optional redemption right, the following definitions are applicable:
 
"" means, with respect to any redemption date applicable to this series of Securities, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
Adjusted Treasury Rate

Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Securities called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.  Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
 
The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.  If fewer than all of the Securities of this series are being redeemed, the Trustee will select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata, by lot or by any other method the Trustee in its sole discretion deems fair and appropriate, in denominations of $2,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.  Upon surrender of any Security of this series redeemed in part, the Holder of the Security will receive a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the surrendered Security.
 
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to satisfy and discharge or to defease this series of Securities prior to maturity as described below, Holders of this series of Securities will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of their Securities pursuant to the offer described below (a "Change of Control Offer").

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will be required, to the extent lawful, to:
 
accept for payment all Securities of this series properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
 
For purposes of the foregoing provisions of a repurchase at the option of holders upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, the following definitions are applicable:
 
"" means that the rating of this series of Securities is lowered by at least two of the three Rating Agencies (as defined below), and such series of Securities is rated below an Investment Grade Rating by at least two of the Rating Agencies, on any date during the period commencing 60 days prior to the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of the Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of this series of Securities is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies).

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and this Security are guaranteed pursuant to Subsidiary Guarantees endorsed hereon as provided in the Indenture.  Each Holder, by holding this Security, agrees to all of the terms and provisions of said Subsidiary Guarantees.

(ii)           in case of any extension of time for payment or renewal of any Securities, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Subsidiary Guarantee would constitute or result in a violation of any applicable fraudulent conveyance or similar law of any relevant jurisdiction, the liability of each Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and its Subsidiary Guarantee shall be reduced to the maximum amount permissible under such fraudulent conveyance or similar law.
 
If the Company shall default in the due and punctual payment of any obligation under the Indenture guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, including under the Securities of this series, without the necessity of action by the Trustee or any Holder of Securities, the Subsidiary Guarantor will promptly and fully make such payments in the same manner as required to have been made by the Company.
 
To the extent permitted by law, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional, and shall not be impaired, modified, released or limited by any occurrence or condition whatsoever, including, without limitation, (i) any compromise, settlement, release, waiver, renewal, extension, indulgence or modification of, or any change in, any of the obligations and liabilities (A) of the Company contained in any Securities guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the Securities to which this Subsidiary Guarantee is affixed, or the Indenture or (B) of any other Subsidiary Guarantor, (ii) any impairment, modification, release or limitation of the liability of the Company or of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in bankruptcy, or any remedy for the enforcement thereof, resulting from the operation of any present or future provision of any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws or from the decision of any court, (iii) the assertion or exercise by the Company, any other Subsidiary Guarantor, or the Trustee of any rights or remedies under any Securities guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the
 
 
Securities to which this Subsidiary Guarantee is affixed, or the Indenture or their delay in or failure to assert or exercise any such rights or remedies, (iv) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets, marshaling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment of, or other similar proceeding affecting, the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor or any of their assets, or the disaffirmance of the Indenture or the Securities in any such proceeding, (v) the release or discharge of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor from the performance or observance of any agreement, covenant, term or condition contained in any of such instruments by operation of law, (vi) the unenforceability of any Securities guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the Securities to which this Subsidiary Guarantee is affixed, or the Indenture or (vii) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor.
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby (i) waives diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of the merger or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or to realize on any collateral, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever with respect to the payment obligations of the Company under the Indenture, (ii) agrees that its obligations hereunder constitute a guarantee of payment and not of collection and are not in any way conditional or contingent upon any attempt to collect from or enforce against the Company or upon any other condition or contingency, (iii) acknowledges that any agreement, instrument or document evidencing the obligations of the Company under the Indenture may be transferred and that the benefit of its obligations hereunder shall extend to each holder of any agreement, instrument or document evidencing such obligations without notice to them and (iv) covenants that, except as provided in Article Eight and Section 1203 of the Indenture with respect to the release of Subsidiary Guarantors, its Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the payment obligations under each series of Securities guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the Securities to which this Subsidiary Guarantee is affixed, and the Indenture.
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that if at any time all or any part of any payment therefore applied by any person to any payment obligation in respect of any series of Securities guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors including the Securities to which this Subsidiary Guarantee is affixed, is, or must be, rescinded or returned for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, such obligation shall for the purposes of the Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence notwithstanding such application, and the Subsidiary Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such payment obligation as though such application had not been made.
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor shall, to the extent of any payment made by it pursuant to the Indenture, be subrogated to all rights of the Trustee and the Holders of
 
 
Securities guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the Securities to which this Subsidiary Guarantee is affixed, as to all payments and damages payable by the Company with respect to which payments have been made by such Subsidiary Guarantor, but, so long as any payment obligation remains outstanding, such right of subrogation on the part of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to the payment in full or discharge of all such payment obligations.
 
Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any other non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders or the Trustee under the Subsidiary Guarantees made pursuant to the Indenture.
 
The Subsidiary Guarantors or any particular Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from this Subsidiary Guarantee upon the terms and subject to certain conditions provided in the Indenture.
 
Upon any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into, any other Person or any transfer, conveyance, sale or other disposition of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 801 of the Indenture, each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees to reaffirm its duties under this Subsidiary Guarantee, and in the event of any such merger, sale, transfer, consolidation, conveyance or other disposition by any Subsidiary Guarantor, except as provided in the Indenture, each remaining Subsidiary Guarantor or the surviving entity, as the case may be, agrees to reaffirm the duties and covenants of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
By delivery of a Supplemental Indenture to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, each Person that becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor after the date of the Indenture will be deemed to have executed and delivered this Subsidiary Guarantee for the benefit of the Holder of the Security upon which this Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed with the same effect as if such Subsidiary Guarantor was named below and has executed and delivered this Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
All terms used in this Subsidiary Guarantee which are defined in the Indenture referred to in the Security upon which this Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed shall have the meanings assigned to them in such Indenture.
 
This Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Security upon which this Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture by manual signature.
 
Reference is made to the Indenture for further provisions with respect to this Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
