Exhibit 10.1
        The purpose of this Plan is to provide eligible employees of Staples, Inc. (the "Company") and certain of its subsidiaries with opportunities to purchase shares of common stock of the Company ("Staples Common Stock"), commencing on November 1, 1998. Twenty-two million seven hundred fifty thousand (22,750,000) shares of Staples Common Stock in the aggregate have been approved for this purpose. Employees participating in the Plan may elect to purchase shares of Staples Common Stock, subject to any limitations that may be imposed by the Board of Directors (the "Board") or the Committee (as defined below).
        1.
    Administration.
    The Plan will be administered by the Committee on Employee Benefit Plans, as constituted pursuant to the terms of the Company's 401(k) Plan (the "Committee"). The Board or the Committee has authority to make rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and its interpretation and decisions with regard thereto shall be final and conclusive. In connection with the administration of the Plan, any two of the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary or Executive Vice President  Human Resources of the Company, acting jointly, by and behalf of the Company, shall have the authority (a) to negotiate, fix and vary the terms of, and to execute and deliver, contracts, agreements, assignments, concessions, licenses, options and all other similar instruments, (b) to engage any agents or contractors, including banks, stock brokers and attorneys, (c) to amend the Plan, and (d) to otherwise do all acts and things necessary or suitable in connection with the exercise of any of the aforementioned powers; provided, that no such authorization shall extend to any amendment of the plan that increases the number of shares available for purchase under the Plan.
        2.
    Eligibility.
    Participation in the Plan will neither be permitted nor denied contrary to the requirements of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and regulations promulgated thereunder. All employees of the Company, including Directors who are employees, and all employees of any subsidiary of the Company (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code) designated by the Board or the Committee from time to time (a "Designated Subsidiary"), are eligible to participate in any one or more of the offerings of Options (as defined in Section 9) to purchase Staples Common Stock under the Plan provided that:
        a.     they are customarily employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for more than 20 hours a week and for more than five months in a calendar year; and
        b.     they have been employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for at least 90 days prior to enrolling in the Plan; and
        c.     they are employees of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary on the first day of the applicable Plan Period (as defined below).
        No employee may be granted an option hereunder if such employee, immediately after the option is granted, owns 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of the stock of the Company or any subsidiary. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in determining the stock ownership of an employee, and all stock which the employee has a contractual right to purchase shall be treated as stock owned by the employee.
        3.
    Offerings.
    The Company will make one or more offerings ("Offerings") to employees to purchase stock under this Plan. The first Offering will begin on November 1, 1998, or the first business day thereafter (the "Offering Commencement Dates") and end on June 30, 1999. Thereafter, each July 1 and January 1 will be an Offering Commencement Date. Each Offering Commencement Date will begin a period (a "Plan Period") during which payroll deductions will be made and held for the
purchase of Staples Common Stock at the end of the Plan Period. The first Plan Period will be eight (8) months and thereafter each Plan Period will be six (6) months ending on June 30 or December 31, as applicable. The Board or the Committee may, at its discretion, choose a different Plan Period of twelve (12) months or less for subsequent Offerings.
        4.
    Participation.
    An employee eligible on the Offering Commencement Date of any Offering may participate in such Offering by enrolling in such manner and at such time approved, from time to time, by the Board or the Committee, prior to the applicable Offering Commencement Date in said Offering. The enrollment will authorize a regular payroll deduction from the Compensation received by the employee during the Plan Period. Unless an employee changes his enrollment in a manner prescribed by the Committee from time to time or withdraws from the Plan, his deductions and purchases will continue at the same rate for future Offerings under the Plan as long as the Plan remains in effect. The term "Compensation" shall mean regular earnings and sales rewards or other sales-related payments made to sales associates in lieu of commissions, and excluding payments for overtime, incentive compensation, shift premiums, bonuses, contributions to all employee fringe benefits plans (except employee contributions in lieu of cash earnings pursuant to any "cash or deferred plan" or "cafeteria plan"), allowances and reimbursements, income or gains on the exercise of Company stock options or stock appreciation rights, and other special payments except to the extent that the inclusion of any such item is specifically approved by the Board.
        5.
    Deductions.
    The Company will maintain payroll deduction accounts for all participating employees. With respect to any Offering made under this Plan, an employee may authorize a payroll deduction in any dollar amount up to a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the Compensation he or she receives during the Plan Period or such shorter period during which deductions from payroll are made. Payroll deductions may be made in any whole percentage up to ten percent (10%). Each participating employee shall designate what percentage of his or her payroll deductions during the Offering shall be used to purchase Staples Common Stock upon the completion of such Offering, subject to any limits as may be imposed for such Offering by the Board or the Committee. Any change in compensation during the Plan Period will result in an automatic corresponding change in the dollar amount withheld.
        No employee may be granted an Option (as defined in Section 9) which permits his rights to purchase Staples Common Stock under this Plan and any other employee stock purchase plan (as defined in Section 423(b) of the Code) of the Company and its subsidiaries, to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of Staples Common Stock (determined at the Offering Commencement Date of the Plan Period) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time.
        6.
    Deduction Changes.
    An employee may discontinue his payroll deduction once during any Plan Period, up to such deadline as may be established by the Board or the Committee, which deadline shall be prior to the close of business on the last business day in a Plan Period, in such manner permitted by the Board or Committee. However, an employee may not increase or decrease his payroll deduction during a Plan Period. If an employee elects to discontinue his payroll deductions during a Plan Period, amounts previously withheld will be refunded to the employee without interest.
        7.
    Interest.
    Interest will not be paid on any employee accounts.
        8.
    Withdrawal of Funds.
    An employee may at any time up to such deadline as may be established by the Board or the Committee, which deadline shall be prior to the close of business on the last business day in a Plan Period and, for any reason, permanently draw out the balance accumulated in the employee's account and thereby withdraw from participation in an Offering. Partial withdrawals are not permitted. The employee may not begin participation again during the remainder of the Plan Period. The employee may participate in any subsequent Offering in accordance with terms and conditions established by the Board or the Committee.
        9.
    Purchase of Shares.
    On the Offering Commencement Date of each Plan Period, the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a participant in the Plan an option ("Option") to purchase on the last day of such Plan Period (the "Exercise Date"), at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, the largest number of shares of Staples Common Stock (subject to any limits as may be imposed for such Offering by the Board or the Committee) as does not exceed the number of shares determined by dividing $12,500 by the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of Staples Common Stock on the Offering Commencement Date of such Plan Period; provided that, if the Plan Period is any period other than six months, then $12,500 shall be adjusted proportionately to reflect the length of the Plan Period.
        The purchase price for each share purchased will be 85% of the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of Staples Common Stock on (i) the first business day of such Plan Period or (ii) the Exercise Date, whichever shall be less. For purposes of this Plan, "Fair Market Value" shall mean (a) the closing price on any national securities exchange on which Staples Common Stock is listed, (b) the closing price of Staples Common Stock on the NASDAQ National Market, or (c) the average of the closing bid and asked prices in the over-the-counter market, whichever is applicable, as published in
The Wall Street Journal
. If no sales of Staples Common Stock were made on such a day, the price of Staples Common Stock for purposes of clauses (a) and (b) above shall be the reported price for the next preceding day on which sales were made.
        Each employee who continues to be a participant in the Plan on the Exercise Date shall be deemed to have exercised his Option at the Option Price on such date and shall be deemed to have purchased from the Company the number of shares of Staples Common Stock (including fractional shares calculated up to 5 decimal places) reserved for the purpose of the Plan that his accumulated payroll deductions on such date will pay for (but not in excess of the maximum number determined in the manner set forth above subject to any limits on such allocation as may be imposed by the Board or the Committee for such Offering.
        Any balance remaining in an employee's payroll deduction account at the end of a Plan Period will be automatically refunded to the employee.
        10.
    Issuance of Certificates.
    Certificates representing shares of Staples Common Stock purchased under the Plan may be issued only in the name of the employee, in the name of the employee and another person of legal age as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, or (in the Company's sole discretion) in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee holder designated by the employee or in the name of the Plan with appropriate allocation to the participating employee. The Company may, in its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, authorize the use of book entry registration of shares in lieu of issuing stock certificates.
        11.
    Rights on Retirement, Death or Termination of Employment.
    In the event of a participating employee's termination of employment prior to the last business day of a Plan Period, no payroll deduction shall be taken from any pay due and owing to an employee and the balance in the employee's account shall be paid to the employee or, in the event of the employee's death (a) to the executor, personal representative, or administrator of the employee's estate or (b) if no such executor, personal representative, or administrator has been appointed to the knowledge of the Company, to such other person(s) as the Company may, in its discretion, designate. If, prior to the last business day of the Plan Period, the Designated Subsidiary by which an employee is employed shall cease to be a subsidiary of the Company, or if the employee is transferred to a subsidiary of the Company that is not a Designated Subsidiary, the employee shall be deemed to have terminated employment for the purposes of this Plan.
        12.
    Optionees Not Stockholders.
    Neither the granting of an Option to an employee nor the deductions from his pay shall constitute such employee a stockholder of the shares of Staples Common Stock covered by an Option under this Plan until such shares have been purchased by and issued to him or to an account for his benefit.
        13.
    Rights Not Transferable.
    Rights under this Plan are not transferable by a participating employee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable during the employee's lifetime only by the employee.
        14.
    Application of Funds.
    All funds received or held by the Company under this Plan may be combined with other corporate funds and may be used for any corporate purpose.
        15.
    Adjustment in Case of Changes Affecting Staples Common Stock.
    In the event of a subdivision or combination of outstanding shares of outstanding shares of Staples Common Stock, or the payment of a dividend of Staples Common Stock, the number of shares approved for this Plan, the share limitation set forth in Section 9, and the purchase price shall be adjusted proportionately. In the event of any other change affecting Staples Common Stock, such adjustment shall be made as may be deemed equitable by the Board or the Committee to give proper effect to such event.
        16.
    Merger.
    If the Company shall at any time merge or consolidate with another corporation and the holders of the capital stock of the Company immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 80% by voting power of the capital stock of the surviving corporation ("Continuity of Control"), the holder of each Option then outstanding will thereafter be entitled to receive at the next Exercise Date upon the exercise of such Option for each share as to which such Option shall be exercised the securities or property which a holder of such shares of Staples Common Stock was entitled to upon and at the time of such merger or consolidation, and the Board or the Committee shall take such steps in connection with such merger or consolidation as the Board or the Committee shall deem necessary to assure that the provisions of Section 15 shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the said securities or property as to which such holder of such Option might thereafter be entitled to receive thereunder.
        In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation which does not involve Continuity of Control, or of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company while unexercised Options remain outstanding under the Plan, (a) subject to the provisions of clauses (b) and (c), after the effective date of such transaction, each holder of an outstanding Option shall be entitled, upon exercise of such Option, to receive in lieu of shares of Staples Common Stock, shares of such stock or other securities as the holders of shares of Staples Common Stock received pursuant to the terms of such transaction; or (b) all outstanding Options may be cancelled by the Board or the Committee as of a date prior to the effective date of any such transaction and all payroll deductions shall be paid out to the participating employees; or (c) all outstanding Options may be cancelled by the Board or the Committee as of the effective date of any such transaction, provided that notice of such cancellation shall be given to each holder of an Option, and each holder of an Option shall have the right to exercise such Option in full based on payroll deductions then credited to his account as of a date determined by the Board or the Committee, which date shall not be less than ten (10) days preceding the effective date of such transaction.
        17.
    Amendment of the Plan.
    The Board may at any time, and from time to time, amend this Plan in any respect, except that (a) if the approval of any such amendment by the shareholders of the Company is required by Section 423 of the Code, such amendment shall not be effected without such approval, and (b) in no event may any amendment be made which would cause the Plan to fail to comply with Section 423 of the Code.
        18.
    Insufficient Shares.
    In the event that the total number of shares of Staples Common Stock specified in elections to be purchased in any Offering plus the number of shares purchased under previous Offerings under this Plan exceeds the maximum number of shares issuable under this Plan, the Board or the Committee will allot the shares then available on a pro rata basis. In the event that the total number of shares of Staples Common Stock specified in elections to be purchased in any Offering exceeds the maximum number of shares available for purchase in such Offering (as specified by the Board or the Committee), the Board or the Committee will allot the shares available on a pro rata basis or in such other manner as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
        19.
    Termination of the Plan.
    This Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board. Upon termination of this Plan all amounts in the accounts of participating employees shall be promptly refunded.
        20.
    Governmental Regulations.
    The Company's obligation to sell and deliver Staples Common Stock under this Plan is subject to the approval of all governmental authorities required in connection with the authorization, issuance or sale of such stock.
        21.
    Governing Law.
    The Plan shall be governed by Massachusetts law except to the extent that such law is preempted by federal law.
        22.
    Issuance of Shares.
    Shares may be issued upon exercise of an Option from authorized but unissued Staples Common Stock, from shares held in the treasury of the Company, or from any other proper source.
        23.
    Notification upon Sale of Shares.
    Each employee agrees, by entering the Plan, to promptly give the Company notice of any disposition of shares purchased under the Plan where such disposition occurs within two years after the date of grant of the Option pursuant to which such shares were purchased.
        24.
    Effective Date and Approval of Shareholders.
    The Plan shall take effect on November 1, 1998 subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company as required by Section 423 of the Code, which approval must occur within twelve months of the adoption of the Plan by the Board.
        25.
    Dividends on Shares Purchased under the Plan.
    Each employee who enrolls in the Plan agrees, for so long as shares of Staples Common Stock purchased by the employee at any time under the Plan (the "Purchased Shares") are held by the employee in an account with a bank, transfer agent, or other financial institution designated by the Company to hold the Purchased Shares (the "Financial Institution"), to (1) participate in the Staples dividend reinvestment program maintained by the Financial Institution (the "DRIP") such that the employee shall receive, in lieu of any cash dividend paid or payable by the Company with respect to the employee's Purchased Shares that are held in an account with the Financial Institution (the "Captive Shares"), shares of Staples Common Stock (including any fractional shares) pursuant to the terms of the DRIP, and (2) allow the Company to take all reasonably necessary and appropriate actions to ensure that the amount of any cash dividend paid or payable by the Company with respect to the employee's Captive Shares is paid in the form of Staples Common Stock instead of cash.

Two million seven hundred seventy five thousand (2,775,000) shares of Staples Common Stock have been approved for this purpose. Employees participating in the Plan may elect to purchase shares of Staples Common Stock, subject to any limitations that may be imposed by the Board of Directors (the "Board") or the Committee (as defined below).
        1.
    Administration.
    The Plan will be administered by the Committee on Employee Benefit Plans, as constituted pursuant to the terms of the Company's 401(k) Plan (the "Committee"). The Board or the Committee has authority to make rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and its interpretation and decisions with regard thereto shall be final and conclusive. In connection with the administration of the Plan, any two of the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary or Executive Vice President  Human Resources of the Company, acting jointly, by and behalf of the Company, shall have the authority (a) to negotiate, fix and vary the terms of, and to execute and deliver, contracts, agreements, assignments, concessions, licenses, options and all other similar instruments, (b) to engage any agents or contractors, including banks, stock brokers and attorneys, (c) to amend the Plan, and (d) to otherwise do all acts and things necessary or suitable in connection with the exercise of any of the aforementioned powers; provided, that no such authorization shall extend to any amendment of the plan that increases the number of shares available for purchase under the Plan.
        2.
    Eligibility.
    All employees of any non-U.S., non-Canadian, non-Netherlands subsidiary of the Company as of July 1, 2000, of any Netherlands subsidiary as of January 1, 2001, of any Canadian subsidiary as of July 1, 2004 and any other subsidiary designated by the Board or the Committee from time to time (each, a "Subsidiary"), including any Director who is an employee of a Subsidiary, are eligible to participate in any one or more of the offerings of Options (as defined in Section 9) to purchase Staples Common Stock under the Plan provided that:
        a.     they have been employed by the Subsidiary for at least 90 days prior to enrolling in the Plan;
        b.     they are employees of the Subsidiary on the first day of the applicable Plan Period (as defined below); and
        c.     they meet any other requirements imposed from time to time by the Board or the Committee on employees of one or more Subsidiaries.
        No employee may be granted an option hereunder if such employee, immediately after the option is granted, owns 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of the stock of the Company or any subsidiary. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall apply in determining the stock ownership of an employee, and all stock which the employee has a contractual right to purchase shall be treated as stock owned by the employee.
        3.
    Offerings.
    The Company will make one or more offerings ("Offerings") to employees to purchase stock under this Plan. The first Offering will begin on July 1, 2000, or the first business day thereafter (the "Offering Commencement Dates") and end on December 31, 2000. Thereafter, each July 1 and January 1 will be an Offering Commencement Date. Each Offering Commencement Date
will begin a period (a "Plan Period") during which payroll deductions will be made and held for the purchase of Staples Common Stock at the end of the Plan Period. The first Plan Period will be six (6) months and thereafter each Plan Period will be six (6) months ending on June 30 or December 31. The Board or the Committee may, at its discretion, choose a different Plan Period of twelve (12) months or less for subsequent Offerings.
        4.
    Participation.
    
        a.
    Enrollment.
    An employee eligible on the Offering Commencement Date of any Offering may participate in such Offering by enrolling, in such manner and at such time approved, from time to time, by the Board or the Committee, prior to the applicable Offering Commencement Date in said Offering. The enrollment will authorize a regular payroll deduction from the Compensation received by the employee during the Plan Period. Unless an employee changes his enrollment in a manner prescribed by the Committee from time to time or withdraws from the Plan, his deductions and purchases will continue at the same rate for future Offerings under the Plan as long as the Plan remains in effect. The term "Compensation" shall be defined by the Board or the Committee from time to time, but until modified shall mean regular earnings and sales rewards or other sales-related payments made to sales associates in lieu of commissions, and excluding payments for overtime, incentive compensation, shift premiums, bonuses, contributions to all employee fringe benefit plans (except employee contributions in lieu of cash earnings pursuant to any "cash or deferred plan" or "cafeteria plan"), allowances and reimbursements, income or gains on the exercise of Company stock options, or stock appreciation rights, and other special payments except to the extent that the inclusion of any such item is specifically approved by the Board.
        b.
    Tax Withholding Authorized.
    The enrollment of each employee shall constitute such participating employee's authorization of his or her employer, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to deduct from such employee's compensation in the relevant month or months (or subsequent months, if appropriate) any amount appropriate for the payment or reimbursement of any tax liability payable by such employee with respect to the grant or exercise of the options hereunder, or the sale of any stock acquired through the exercise of such option.
        5.
    Deductions.
    The Company will maintain payroll deduction accounts for all participating employees. With respect to any Offering made under this Plan, an employee may authorize a payroll deduction in any amount up to a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the Compensation he or she receives during the Plan Period or such shorter period during which deductions from payroll are made. Payroll deductions may be made in any whole percentage up to ten percent (10%). Each participating employee shall designate what percentage of his or her payroll deductions during the Offering shall be used to purchase Staples Common Stock upon the completion of such Offering, subject to any limits as may be imposed for such Offering by the Board or the Committee. Any change in compensation during the Plan Period will result in an automatic corresponding change in the amount withheld. The payroll deductions shall be made in the applicable local currency and will be converted into United Stated currency at the prevailing rate of exchange in effect on the date determined by the Board or the Committee from time to time. All amounts deducted may be transferred to an account of the Company or the Subsidiary outside the country in which such employee is employed.
        The Board or the Committee may permit direct contributions by eligible employees of a Subsidiary instead of payroll deductions if it determines such action to be advisable, and on such terms as it deems advisable. In the event that such direct contributions are permitted, the Board or Committee may modify other terms of this Plan to reflect such direct contributions.
        No employee may be granted an Option (as defined in Section 9) which permits his rights to purchase Staples Common Stock under this Plan and any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company and its subsidiaries (as defined by the Board or the Committee), to accrue at a rate which
exceeds $25,000 of the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of Staples Common Stock (determined at the Offering Commencement Date of the Plan Period) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time. Options granted during any Plan Period to all officers and Directors of the Company shall not equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total Options granted during such Plan Period.

    Deduction Changes.
    An employee may discontinue his payroll deduction once during any Plan Period, up to such deadline as may be established by the Board or the Committee, prior to the close of business on the last business day, in such manner as may be permitted by the Board or Committee. However, an employee may not increase or decrease his payroll deduction, during a Plan Period. If an employee elects to discontinue his payroll deductions during a Plan Period, amounts previously withheld will be refunded to the employee without interest. The refund will be made in the currency in which such Participant's deductions were originally made or, if such employee is employed in a country which maintains a fixed exchange rate between its local currency and the Euro, there may be repayment in Euros ("Payment in Euros").
        7.
    Interest.
    Interest will not be paid on any employee accounts.
        8.
    Withdrawal of Funds.
    An employee may at any time up to such deadline as may be established by the Board or the Committee, which deadline shall be prior to the close of business on the last business day in a Plan Period, and for any reason, permanently draw out the balance accumulated in the employee's account (which will be paid in the local currency or, at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, there may be Payment in Euros), and thereby withdraw from participation in an Offering. Partial withdrawals are not permitted. The employee may not begin participation again during the remainder of the Plan Period. The employee may participate in any subsequent Offering in accordance with terms and conditions established by the Board or the Committee.
        9.
    Purchase of Shares.
    On the Offering Commencement Date of each Plan Period, the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a participant in the Plan an option ("Option") to purchase on the last day of such Plan Period (the "Exercise Date"), at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, the largest number of shares of Staples Common Stock (subject to any limits as may be imposed for such Offering by the Board or the Committee) as does not exceed the number of shares determined by dividing $12,500 by the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of Staples Common Stock on the Offering Commencement Date of such Plan Period; provided that, if the Plan Period is any period other than six months, then $12,500 shall be adjusted proportionately to reflect the length of the Plan Period.
        The purchase price for each share purchased will be 85% of the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of Staples Common Stock on (i) the first business day of such Plan Period or (ii) the Exercise Date, whichever shall be less. For purposes of this Plan, "Fair Market Value" shall mean (a) the closing price on any national securities exchange on which Staples Common Stock is listed, (b) the closing price of Staples Common Stock on the NASDAQ National Market or (c) the average of the closing bid and asked prices in the over-the-counter-market, whichever is applicable, as published in
The Wall Street Journal
. If no sales of Staples Common Stock were made on such a day, the price of Staples Common Stock for purposes of clauses (a) and (b) above shall be the reported price for the next preceding day on which sales were made.
        Each employee who continues to be a participant in the Plan on the Exercise Date shall be deemed to have exercised his Option at the Option Price on such date and shall be deemed to have purchased from the Company the number of shares of Staples Common Stock (including fractional shares calculated up to 5 decimal places) reserved for the purpose of the Plan that his accumulated payroll deductions on such date will pay for, in United States currency as of that date, but not in excess
of the maximum number determined in the manner set forth above, subject to any limits on allocation as may be imposed by the Board or the Committee for such Offering.
        Any balance remaining in an employee's payroll deduction account at the end of a Plan Period will be automatically refunded to the employee in the local currency or there may be Payment in Euros.
        10.
    Issuance of Certificates.
    Certificates representing shares of Staples Common Stock purchased under the Plan may be issued only in the name of the employee, in the name of the employee and another person of legal age as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, or (in the Company's sole discretion) in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee holder designated by the employee or in the name of the Plan with appropriate allocation to the participating employee. The Company may, in its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable laws, authorize the use of book entry registration of shares in lieu of issuing stock certificates.
        11.
    Rights on Retirement Death or Termination of Employment.
    In the event of a participating employee's termination of employment prior to the last business day of a Plan Period, no payroll deduction shall be taken from any pay due and owing to an employee and the balance in the employee's account shall be paid to the employee or, in the event of the employee's death (a) to the executor, personal representative, or administrator of the employee's estate or (b) if no such executor, personal representative, or administrator has been appointed to the knowledge of the Company, to such other person(s) as the Company may, in its discretion, designate. If, prior to the last business day of the Plan Period, the designated Subsidiary by which an employee is employed shall cease to be a subsidiary of the Company, or if the employee is transferred to a subsidiary of the Company that is not a Subsidiary, the employee shall be treated hereunder as a Terminating Employee.
        12.
    Optionees Not Stockholders.
    Neither the granting of an Option to an employee nor the deductions from his pay shall constitute such employee a stockholder of the shares of Staples Common Stock covered by an Option under this Plan until such shares have been purchased by and issued to him or to an account for his benefit.
        13.
    Rights Not Transferable.
    Rights under this Plan are not transferable by a participating employee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable during the employee's lifetime only by the employee.
        14.
    Application of Funds.
    To the extent consistent with applicable law, all funds received or held by the Company or any Subsidiary under this Plan may be combined with other corporate funds and may be used for any corporate purpose and moved outside the country in which they are deducted from payroll.
        15.
    Adjustment in Case of Changes Affecting Staples Common Stock.
    In the event of a subdivision or combination of outstanding shares of Common Stock, or the payment of a dividend of Staples Common Stock, the number of shares approved for this Plan, and the share limitation set forth in Section 9, and the purchase price shall be adjusted proportionately. In the event of any other change affecting Staples Common Stock, such adjustment shall be made as may be deemed equitable by the Board or the Committee to give proper effect to such event.
        16.
    Merger.
    If the Company shall at any time merge or consolidate with another corporation and the holders of the capital stock of the Company immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to hold at least 80% by voting power of the capital stock of the surviving corporation ("Continuity of Control"), the holder of each Option then outstanding will thereafter be entitled to receive at the next Exercise Date upon the exercise of such Option for each share as to which such Option shall be exercised the securities or property which a holder of such shares of Staples Common Stock was entitled to upon and at the time of such merger or consolidation, and the Board or the Committee shall take such steps in connection with such merger or consolidation as the Board or the Committee shall deem necessary to assure that the provisions of Section 15 shall thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the said securities or property as to which such holder of such Option might thereafter be entitled to receive thereunder.
        In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation which does not involve Continuity of Control, or of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company while unexercised Options remain outstanding under the Plan, (a) subject to the provisions of clauses (b) and (c), after the effective date of such transaction, each holder of an outstanding Option shall be entitled, upon exercise of such Option, to receive in lieu of shares of Staples Common Stock, shares of such stock or other securities as the holders of shares of Staples Common Stock received pursuant to the terms of such transaction; or (b) all outstanding Options may be cancelled by the Board or the Committee as of a date prior to the effective date of any such transaction and all payroll deductions shall be paid out to the participating employees; or (c) all outstanding Options may be cancelled by the Board or the Committee as of the effective date of any such transaction, provided that notice of such cancellation shall be given to each holder of an Option, and each holder of an Option shall have the right to exercise such Option in full based on payroll deductions then credited to his account as of a date determined by the Board or the Committee, which date shall not be less than ten (10) days preceding the effective date of such transaction.
        17.
    Amendment of the Plan.
    The Board may at any time, and from time to time, amend this Plan in any respect.
        18.
    Insufficient Shares.
    In the event that the total number of shares of Staples Common Stock specified in elections to be purchased under any Offering plus the number of shares purchased under previous Offerings under this Plan exceeds the maximum number of shares issuable under this Plan, the Board or the Committee will allot the shares then available on a pro rata basis. In the event that the total number of shares of Staples Common Stock specified in elections to be purchased in any Offering exceeds the maximum number of shares available for purchase in such Offering (as specified by the Board or the Committee), the Board or the Committee will allot the shares available on a pro rata basis or in such other manner as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
        19.

    The Plan shall take effect on July 1, 2000.
        25.
    Dividends on Shares Purchased under the Plan.
    Each employee who enrolls in the Plan agrees, for so long as shares of Staples Common Stock purchased by the employee at any time under the Plan (the "Purchased Shares") are held by the employee in an account with a bank, transfer agent, or other financial institution designated by the Company to hold the Purchased Shares (the "Financial Institution"), to (1) participate in the Staples dividend reinvestment program maintained by the
Financial Institution (the "DRIP") such that the employee shall receive, in lieu of any cash dividend paid or payable by the Company with respect to the employee's Purchased Shares that are held in an account with the Financial Institution (the "Captive Shares"), shares of Staples Common Stock (including any fractional shares) pursuant to the terms of the DRIP, and (2) allow the Company to take all reasonably necessary and appropriate actions to ensure that the amount of any cash dividend paid or payable by the Company with respect to the employee's Captive Shares is paid in the form of Staples Common Stock instead of cash.

Staples in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of stock of Staples), is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of Staples representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of Staples' then outstanding securities (other than pursuant to a merger or consolidation described in clause (1) or (2) of subsection (C) below); (B) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board of Directors of Staples (as of the date hereof, the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by Staples' stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board (other than an election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the directors of Staples, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) shall be, for purposes of this Agreement, considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; (C) the stockholders of Staples approve a merger or consolidation of Staples with any other corporation, and such merger or consolidation is consummated, other than (1) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of Staples outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 75% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of Staples or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (2) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of Staples (or similar transaction) in which no "person" (as defined above) acquires more than 30% of the combined voting power of Staples' then outstanding securities; or (D) the stockholders of Staples approve an agreement for the sale or disposition by Staples of all or substantially all of Staples' assets, and such sale or disposition is consummated.
         (ii)  "Surviving Corporation" shall mean (x) in the case of a Change in Control pursuant to clause (A) or clause (B) of Section 7(a)(i), Staples; (y) in the case of a Change in Control pursuant to clause (C) of Section 7(a)(i), the surviving or resulting corporation in such merger or consolidation; and (z) in the case of a Change in Control pursuant to Clause (D) of Section 7(a)(i), the entity acquiring the majority of the assets being sold or disposed of by Staples.
        (iii)  "Cause," as determined by Staples or the Surviving Corporation (which determination shall be conclusive), shall mean:
        (A)  Willful failure by the Recipient to substantially perform his or her duties with Staples (other than any failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness); provided, however, that Staples has given the Recipient a written demand for substantial performance, which specifically identifies the areas in which the Recipient's performance is substandard, and the Recipient has not cured such failure within 30 days after delivery of the demand. No act or failure to act on the Recipient's part will be deemed "willful" unless the Recipient acted or failed to act without a good faith or reasonable belief that his or her conduct was in Staples' best interest; or
        (B)  Breach by the Recipient of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, proprietary information, non-disclosure, non-competition, non-solicitation or other similar agreement between the Recipient and Staples, including, without limitation, the Proprietary and Confidential Information Agreement and/or the Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreement; or
        (C)  Violation by the Recipient of the Code of Ethics or an attempt by the Recipient to secure any improper personal profit in connection with the business of Staples; or
        (D)  Failure by the Recipient to devote his or her full working time to the affairs of Staples except as may be authorized in writing by Staples' CEO or other authorized Company official; or

(b)
    Effect of Change in Control
.    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2, if while the Recipient is employed by Staples (1) a Change in Control of Staples occurs on or prior to the Award Date, then the greater of (X) a number of Shares determined as if the Target FY 2009 EPS were achieved or (Y) the number of Shares determined to be issuable under Section 2(b) of this Agreement will be awarded and fully vest or (2) if a Change in Control of Staples occurs after the Award Date but prior to a Vesting Date, all unvested Shares will fully vest, in each case, if:
          (i)  At the time the Change in Control is deemed to occur, the Recipient:
        (A)  Is not offered employment with the Surviving Corporation (or is not allowed to continue his or her employment, if the Surviving Corporation is Staples) in a position (1) in which the title, employment duties and responsibilities, conditions of employment, and the level of compensation and benefits are at least equivalent to those in effect during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Change in Control and (2) that does not involve a relocation of the Recipient's principal place of employment of more than an additional 50 miles from the Recipient's primary residence at the time of the Change in Control, or
        (B)  Does not accept (or continue) employment with the Surviving Corporation (regardless of position, compensation or location) (other than as a result of retirement); or
         (ii)  Within one year following the date of the Change in Control, the Recipient either:
        (A)  Is discharged without Cause; or
        (B)  Resigns or retires because his or her title or employment duties and responsibilities are diminished, his or her conditions of employment are adversely changed, the level of his or her compensation and benefits are reduced, or his or her principal place of employment is relocated by more than an additional 50 miles from his or her primary residence at the time of the Change in Control.
Vesting of Shares pursuant to clause (i) above will be effective immediately prior to the Change in Control. Vesting of Shares pursuant to clause (ii) above will be effective upon the date of discharge, resignation or retirement. The effective date for vesting pursuant to this Section 7(b) will be considered a Vesting Date hereunder.
8.    
Withholding Taxes
.    Staples' obligation to deliver the Shares shall be subject to the Recipient's satisfaction of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements. Staples may deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Recipient, including salary and bonus payments, and may withhold or sell a sufficient number of Shares on behalf of the Recipient to satisfy such tax obligations. Subject to Staples' prior approval, which may be withheld in its sole discretion, the Recipient may elect to satisfy such tax withholding obligations (i) by causing Staples to withhold Shares or (ii) by delivering to Staples shares of Common Stock already owned by the Recipient.

Recipient may only transfer Shares that may be issued pursuant to this Agreement following a Vesting Date.
10.    
Miscellaneous
.
        (a)   Except as provided herein, this Agreement may not be amended or otherwise modified unless evidenced in writing and signed by Staples and the Recipient unless the Board of Directors determines that the amendment or modification, taking into account any related action, would not materially and adversely affect the Recipient.
        (b)   All notices under this Agreement shall be mailed or delivered by hand to Staples at its main office, Attn: Secretary, and to the Recipient to his or her last known address on the employment records of Staples or at such other address as may be designated in writing by either of the parties to one another.
