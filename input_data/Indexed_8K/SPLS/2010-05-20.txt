EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Staples, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2010 Performance
FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 20, 2010--Staples, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS) announced today the results for its first quarter ended May 1, 2010. Total company sales for the first quarter of 2010 increased four percent to $6.1 billion compared to the first quarter of 2009. Net income for the first quarter of 2010 increased 32 percent year over year to $189 million, and diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, increased 30 percent to $0.26 from the $0.20 achieved in the first quarter of 2009.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the first quarter of 2010 increased 27 percent compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.22 achieved in the first quarter of 2009. These adjusted results exclude pre-tax integration and restructuring expense of $21 million during the first quarter of 2010, and $19 million during the first quarter of 2009.
Our first quarter performance was strong across the board, said Ron Sargent, Staples chairman and chief executive officer. With sales and profit improvement in all three of our businesses, the year is off to a good start.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter 2010 operating income rate increased 105 basis points to 5.98 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of integration and restructuring expense, first quarter 2010 operating income rate increased 107 basis points to 6.33 percent. This increase primarily reflects improvements related to the integration of Corporate Express and leverage of distribution and marketing expense.
The companys effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 37.5 percent, compared to 34.5 percent for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to the expiration of tax provisions that allow for the deferral of income tax on certain foreign earnings.
The company generated free cash flow of $144 million after $49 million in capital expenditures, ending the first quarter of 2010 with approximately $2.7 billion in liquidity, including $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
North American Delivery
North American Delivery sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $2.5 billion, an increase of two percent in US dollars, and flat in local currency compared to the first quarter of 2009. In addition to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, the top line benefitted from strong customer acquisition, which was offset by reduced sales to existing customers. Operating income rate increased 162 basis points to 8.26 percent compared to the first quarter 2009. This increase primarily reflects improvements related to the integration of Corporate Express, reduced amortization expense, as well as a favorable product mix, as customers purchased more discretionary products compared to the first quarter of 2009.
North American Retail
North American Retail sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $2.3 billion, an increase of six percent in US dollars, and two percent in local currency compared to the first quarter of 2009. First quarter 2010 comparable store sales increased one percent versus the first quarter of 2009 reflecting increased customer traffic, partially offset by lower average order size. Operating income rate increased 30 basis points to 7.64 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009. This improvement primarily reflects reduced marketing and depreciation expense, partially offset by a higher mix of low margin technology products. North American Retail opened 20 stores and closed three stores, ending the first quarter of 2010 with 1,888 stores in North America.
International
International sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.3 billion, an increase of six percent in US dollars, and a decrease of four percent in local currency compared to the first quarter of 2009. Top line growth in the European Catalog business was offset by lower sales in the European Printing Systems business, as well as a five percent decrease in comparable store sales in Europe compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operating income rate increased 121 basis points to 2.88 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009. This increase primarily reflects improvements related to the integration of Corporate Express, as well as reduced marketing expense, somewhat offset by increased losses in the European Printing Systems business compared to the first quarter of 2009. European Retail closed three stores during the first quarter of 2010. The International business ended the first quarter of 2010 with 369 stores.
Outlook
The companys outlook assumes a modest economic recovery in 2010. For the second quarter of 2010, the company expects sales to increase in the low single-digits compared to the same period of 2009. The company assumes that the US Congress will not extend the provisions that allow for the deferral of income tax on certain foreign earnings prior to the end of the second quarter of 2010, and as a result anticipates its effective tax rate will be 37.5 percent. The company expects to achieve diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, in the range of $0.16 to $0.18 for the second quarter of 2010. Excluding approximately $15 million to $20 million of pre-tax integration and restructuring expense, or approximately $0.02 per share, the company expects to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2010 in the range of $0.18 to $0.20.
For the full year 2010, the company expects total company sales to increase in the low single-digits compared to the full year 2009. The company assumes that prior to the end of the fiscal year 2010 the US Congress will extend the provisions that allow for the deferral of income tax on certain foreign earnings, and as a result anticipates its effective tax rate for the full year will be 34.5 percent. The company expects to achieve diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, in the range of $1.20 to $1.28 for the full year 2010. Excluding approximately $45 million to $55 million of pre-tax integration and restructuring expense, or approximately $0.05 per share, the company expects to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2010 in the range of $1.25 to $1.33.
The company expects to incur the following expenses during the second quarter and full year 2010.
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information
This press release presents certain results both with and without integration and restructuring expense associated with Corporate Express. This press release also presents certain results both with and without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The presentation of results that exclude these items are non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and should not be considered superior to, or as a substitute for, the presentation of results determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide a better comparison to prior periods because the adjustments do not affect the on-going operations of the combined businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the operating results of the companys business against prior year results and its operating plan, and to forecast and analyze future periods. Management recognizes there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as they may reduce comparability with other companies that use different methods to calculate similar non-GAAP measures. Management generally compensates for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of these items by considering the impact of these items separately according to GAAP as well as non-GAAP results and outlook, and in addition, in this press release, by presenting the most comparable GAAP measures ahead of non-GAAP measures and providing a reconciliation that indicates and describes the adjustments made.
Today's Conference Call
The company will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. (ET) to review these results and its outlook. Investors may listen to the call at .
