On November 4, 2010, Staples, Inc. entered into a new Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement" or "Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A, as Administrative Agent and other lending institutions named therein. The New Credit Agreement replaces the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of October 13, 2006, as amended, which provided for a maximum borrowing of $750.0 million and was due to expire in October 2011 (the "Prior Agreement"). As of November 4, 2010, no borrowings were outstanding under the Prior Agreement.
 
The New Credit Agreement provides for a maximum borrowing of $1.0 billion which pursuant to an accordion feature may be increased to $1.5 billion upon the request of Staples and the agreement of the lenders participating in the increase.  Borrowings made pursuant to the New Credit Agreement may be syndicated loans, swing line loans, multicurrency loans, or letters of credit, the combined sum of which may not exceed the maximum borrowing amount.  Amounts borrowed under the New Credit Agreement may be borrowed, repaid, and reborrowed from time to time until November 4, 2014.  The New Credit Agreement will serve as a backstop to Staples' commercial paper program.
 
Borrowings made pursuant to the New Credit Agreement as syndicated loans will bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate) plus a percentage spread based on Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio, or (ii) the base rate (determined as the highest of (a) Bank of America's prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%) plus a percentage spread based on the Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Each swing line loan will bear interest at the base rate plus a percentage spread based on Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Each multicurrency loan will bear interest at the relevant published reference rate for the currency borrowed plus a percentage spread based on Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Staples' will pay a fee ranging from 0.425% to 1.65% for letters of credit depending on the type of letter of credit and Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Under the Agreement, Staples also agrees to pay a facility fee at rates that range from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum depending on Staples' credit rating and fixed charge coverage ratio.  Staples may select interest periods of one, two, three or six months for eurocurrency loans, subject to availability.  Interest will be payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly.
 
The New Credit Agreement is unsecured and ranks pari passu with Staples' public notes and other indebtedness.  The borrowings under this New Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured unsubordinated basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee Staples' publicly issued notes and its commercial paper program.
 
The New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on Staples and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, sale-leaseback transactions, subordinated debt, and transactions with affiliates.  The covenants permit Staples to use proceeds of the credit loans for working capital and capital expenditures and for all other lawful corporate purposes, including payment of dividends, acquisitions of assets and capital stock of other companies and share repurchases, and to provide liquidity in connection with the commercial paper program, in each case to the extent permitted in the Agreement.  The Agreement also contains financial covenants that require Staples to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 and a maximum adjusted funded debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.75.
 
The New Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by Staples proving to be false in any material respect, certain
insolvency or receivership events affecting Staples or its significant subsidiaries, defaults relating to other indebtedness of at least $75 million in the aggregate and a change in control of Staples (as defined in the Agreement). In the event of a default by Staples, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the lenders' commitments to make loans under the Agreement, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or Administrative Agent under the Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of Staples will become immediately due and payable.
 
Certain of the lenders party to the New Credit Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, for Staples and its subsidiaries various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.

(a)           The Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall determine the Spot Rates as of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating Dollar Equivalent amounts of Loans, Maximum Drawing Amounts and Reimbursement Obligations denominated in Alternative Currencies.  Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur.  Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by the Borrower hereunder or calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as so determined by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable.

(a)           The Borrower may from time to time request that Eurocurrency Rate Loans be made or Letters of Credit issued in a currency other than those specifically listed in the definition of "Alternative Currency;" that such requested currency is a lawful currency (other than Dollars) that is readily available and freely transferable and convertible into Dollars.  In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders; and in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank.
provided
 
(b)           Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time), twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Loan or issuance of Letter of Credit (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank, in its or their sole discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof; and in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank thereof.

(c)           Any failure by a Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to permit Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made or Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested currency.  If the Administrative Agent and all the Lenders consent to making Eurocurrency Rate Loans in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans; and if the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances.

Funding Procedures
.  Each of the relevant Lenders will make available to the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent's Head Office, in Same Day Funds, the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of the requested Revolving Credit Loans not later than 1:30 p.m. (New York time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Revolving Credit Loans denominated in Dollars and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Revolving Credit Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency.  Upon receipt from each Lender of such amount, and upon receipt of the documents required by 9 and 10 hereof and the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent applicable, the Administrative Agent will make available to the Borrower the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Loans made available to the Administrative Agent by the relevant Lenders.  The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent its Commitment Percentage of the requested Revolving Credit Loans on
any Drawdown Date shall not excuse any other Lender from making available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such other Lender's Commitment Percentage of any requested Revolving Credit Loans.
 
2.4.2.   
Advances by Administrative Agent
.
 
(a)           The Administrative Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by any Lender prior to a Drawdown Date, assume that such Lender has made available to the Administrative Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Credit Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date, and the Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (a) the average computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of the Overnight Rate for each day included in such period, times (b) the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans, times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Drawdown Date to the date on which the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans shall become immediately available to the Administrative Agent, and the denominator of which is 360.  A statement of the Administrative Agent submitted to such Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this 2.4.2 shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing to the Administrative Agent by such Lender.  If the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days following such Drawdown Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from the Borrower on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans made on such Drawdown Date and the Borrower may take the actions permitted under 4.12 hereof to replace such Lender.  Any payment by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent of any Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this 2.4.2 shall be deemed to be a payment to the Administrative Agent in respect of the advances made by the Administrative Agent in respect of the Revolving Credit Loans that were to be made by the Lender that failed to make such Revolving Credit Loans.
 
(b)           Unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to such Lender.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in Same Day Funds, then each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.
 
(c)           A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under 2.4.2(a) and (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
2.5.      
Reduction of Total Commitment
.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent to reduce by $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or terminate entirely the Total Commitment, whereupon the Commitment Amount of each Lender shall be reduced pro rata in accordance with its Commitment Percentage by the amount specified in such notice or, as the case may be, terminated.  Promptly after receiving any notice of the Borrower delivered pursuant to this 2.5, the Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of the substance thereof.  Upon the effective date of any such reduction or termination, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders the full amount of the Facility Fee then accrued on the amount of the reduction.  No reduction or termination of the Total Commitment may be reinstated.
 
2.6.      
Maturity and Other Mandatory Repayments of Revolving Credit Loans

(a)           The Borrower promises to pay on the Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the Maturity Date, all of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding to the Borrower on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
 
(b)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans plus (ii) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans plus (iii) the Maximum Drawing Amount plus (iv) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations is equal to or exceeds an amount equal to 102% of the Total Commitment, then the Borrower shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iv) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Total Commitment then in effect, such payment to be applied to the Revolving Credit Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(c)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans plus (ii) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans plus (iii) the Maximum Drawing Amount plus (iv) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds an amount equal to 100% of the Total Commitment, but is less than 102%, then the Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iv) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Total Commitment then in effect, such payment to be applied to the Revolving Credit Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(d)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (ii) the Maximum Drawing Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (iii) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative
Currencies exceeds an amount equal to 102% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit, then the Borrower shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iii) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, such payment to be applied to such Revolving Credit Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(e)           If at any time the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the sum, without duplication, of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (ii) the Maximum Drawing Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies plus (iii) all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies exceeds an amount equal to 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit, but is less than 102%, then the Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount sufficient to reduce the sum of clauses (i)-(iii) as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, such payment to be applied to such Revolving Credit Loans or Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations for the respective accounts of the Lenders.
 
(f)            So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans shall, subject to 4.16, be allocated among the Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as practicable to the respective unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made by each Lender, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior payments or repayments not exactly in proportion.
 
2.7.      
Optional Repayments of Revolving Credit Loans
.  The Borrower shall have the right, at its election, to repay the outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, as a whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium, provided that any full or partial repayment of the outstanding amount of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans pursuant to this 2.7 may be made only on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto unless the Borrower pays each Lender in accordance with 4.10, the costs and expenses incurred by such Lender as a result of the repayment of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior written notice no later than (a) 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Base Rate Loans, (b) 1:00 p.m. (New York time), three (3) Business Days prior to any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, and (c) 1:00 p.m. (New York time), four (4) Business Days (or five (5), in the case of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Australian Dollars or Special Notice Currencies) prior to any proposed repayment pursuant to this 2.7 of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each case specifying the proposed date of repayment of such Revolving Credit Loans and the principal amount to be repaid.  Each such partial repayment of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall be applied, in the absence of instruction by the Borrower, first to the principal of Base Rate Loans and then to the principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans.  Each partial repayment of Revolving Credit Loans shall, subject to 4.16, be allocated among the Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made by
each Lender being repaid, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior repayments not exactly in proportion.

(ii)           each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin plus (in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan of any Lender which is denominated in an Alternative Currency and is lent from a Lending Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State) the Mandatory Cost.
 
(b)           The Borrower promises to pay interest on each Revolving Credit Loan in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable with respect thereto.
 
2.9.      
Conversion Options
.
 
2.9.1.   
Conversion to Different Type of Revolving Credit Loan
.  The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert any outstanding Revolving Credit Loan to a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type, provided that (a) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Dollars to a Base Rate Loan, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at least one (1) Business Day's prior written notice of such election; (b) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency to a Base Rate Loan, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at least four (4) Business Days' (or five (5) Business Days in the case of Loans denominated in Australian Dollars or a Special Notice Currency) prior written notice of such election; (c) with respect to any such conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in Dollars, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of such election; (d) with respect to any such conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at least four (4) Business Days' (or five (5) Business Days in the case of Loans denominated in Australian Dollars or a Special Notice Currency) prior written notice of such election; (e) unless the Borrower complies with 4.10, with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan, such conversion shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto; and (f) no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto.  On the date on which such conversion is being made each Lender shall take such action as is necessary to transfer its Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans to its Lending
 
Office for domestic loans or its Lending Office for Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as the case may be.  All or any part of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of any Type may be converted into a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type as provided herein, provided that any partial conversion shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Revolving Credit Loan to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be irrevocable by the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Loan may be converted into a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
 
2.9.2.   
Continuation of Type of Revolving Credit Loan
.  Any Revolving Credit Loan of any Type may be continued as a Revolving Credit Loan of the same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in 2.9.1 hereof; that no Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default of which officers of the Administrative Agent active upon the Borrower's account have actual knowledge.  In the event that the Borrower fails to provide any such notice with respect to continuation of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan as such, than such Eurocurrency Rate shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto; , , that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one month.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders and the Borrower promptly when any such automatic conversion contemplated by this 2.9.2 is scheduled to occur.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no Issuing Bank shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. The responsibility of each Issuing Bank and its correspondents to the Borrower and the Lenders shall be only to determine that the documents (including each draft) delivered under each Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity on their face in all material respects with such Letter of Credit.

The Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, upon demand by such Lender, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this 4.6, including any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurocurrency Rate Loans hereunder.

To the extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not reflected in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate then the Borrower agrees to pay such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent for the amount of such reduction in the return on capital as and when such reduction is determined upon presentation by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent of a certificate in accordance with 4.9 hereof, that the Borrower shall not be liable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent for costs incurred more than sixty (60) days prior to receipt by the Borrower of the notice referred to in the immediately preceding sentence from such Lender or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent.  Each Lender shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith and on an equitable basis.

The Mandatory Cost (to the extent applicable) is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with:
 
(a)
                                 
the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions); or
 
(b)
                                
the requirements of the European Central Bank.
 
2.
                                      
On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as practicable thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below.  The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.  The Administrative Agent will, at the request of the Borrower or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower or such Lender as the case may be, a statement setting forth the calculation of any Mandatory Cost.
Additional Cost Rate
 
3.
                                      
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Administrative Agent.  This percentage will be certified by such Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent as the actual cost (expressed as a percentage of such Lender's participation in all Loans made from such Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from that Lending Office.
 
4.

in relation to any Loan in Sterling:
 
 
(b)
                                
in relation to any Loan in any currency other than Sterling:
 
 
Where:
"A"
                               
is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
"B"
                                 
is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Rate, the Mandatory Cost and any interest charged on overdue amounts pursuant to the first sentence of 4.11 and, in the case of interest (other than on overdue amounts) charged at the Default Rate, without counting any increase in interest rate effected by the charging of the Default Rate) payable for the relevant Interest Period of such Loan.
"C"
                                 
is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
"D"
                                
is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
"E"
                                  
is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent pursuant to below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.

Tariff Base
 
6.
                                      
In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05).  A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.  The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
 
7.
                                      
If requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, each Lender with a Lending Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the rate of charge payable by such Lender to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by such Lender as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to such Lender for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of such Lender.
8.
                                      
Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate.  In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
 
(a)
                                 
its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of the Lending Office out of which it is making available its participation in the relevant Loan; and
 
(b)
                                
any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
 
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
 
9.
                                      
The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Lender for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as its Lending Office.
 
10.
                                
The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over- or under-compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
 
11.
                                
The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
 
12.
                                
Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
 
13.
                                
The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Borrower and the Lenders, determine and notify to all parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

WHEREAS
, the Company and the Guarantors are members of a group of related entities, the success of any one of which is dependent in part on the success of the other members of such group;
 
WHEREAS
, each of the Guarantors expects to receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the extensions of credit to the Company by the Lenders pursuant to the Credit Agreement (which benefits are hereby acknowledged);
 
WHEREAS
, it is a condition precedent to the Lenders' willingness to make any loans or otherwise extend credit to the Company under the Credit Agreement that the Guarantors execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, a guaranty substantially in the form hereof; and
 
WHEREAS
, the Guarantors wish to guaranty the Company's obligations to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under or in respect of the Credit Agreement as provided herein;
 
NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration of the premises contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Lenders and the Administrative Agent as follows:
 
1.          . 
Definitions
The term "Obligations" and all other capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings provided therefor in the Credit Agreement.
 
2.          . 
Guaranty of Payment and Performance
Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent the full and punctual
 
payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by required pre-payment, by acceleration or otherwise), as well as the performance, of all of the Obligations including all such which would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay pursuant to 362(a) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and the operation of 502(b) and 506(b) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.  This Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance of all of the Obligations and not of their collectibility only and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender first attempt to collect any of the Obligations from the Company or resort to any collateral security or other means of obtaining payment.  Should the Company default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder with respect to such Obligations in default shall, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, become immediately due and payable to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, without demand or notice of any nature, all of which are expressly waived by each of the Guarantors.  Payments by any Guarantor hereunder may be required by the Administrative Agent on any number of occasions.  All payments by the Guarantors hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, in the manner and at the place of payment specified therefor in the Credit Agreement, for the account of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law.
 
3.          .

provided
 
4.          . 
Waivers by Guarantors; Lender's Freedom to Act
The Guarantors agree that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect thereto.  Each of the Guarantors waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Guarantors agrees to the provisions of any instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation and agrees that the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any right or remedy against the Company or any other entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of the Obligations; (ii) any extensions, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any Obligation; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescissions, waivers, compromise, refinancing, consolidation or other amendments or modifications of any of the terms or provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (iv) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other person primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation; (v) the adequacy of any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against any collateral security or other means of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations; (vi) the impairment of any collateral securing any of the Obligations, including without limitation the failure to perfect or preserve any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Lender might have in such collateral security or the substitution, exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral security; or (vii) any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or otherwise operate as a release or discharge of such Guarantor, all of which may be done without notice to such Guarantor.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any "one action" or "anti-deficiency" law which would otherwise prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, or exercising any other right or remedy (including any right of set-off), against such Guarantor before or after the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or (B) any other law which in any other way would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
 
5.          . 
Unenforceability of Obligations Against Company
If for any reason the Company has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable from the Company by reason of the Company's insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be binding on each of the Guarantors to the same extent as if such Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such Obligations.  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the commencement of any case or other proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation or similar law of any jurisdiction, or for any other reason, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any Obligation shall be immediately due and payable by the Guarantors.

Subrogation; Subordination
.
 
6.1        . 
Waiver of Rights Against Company
Until the final payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations, the Guarantors shall not exercise and hereby waive any rights against the Company arising as a result of payment by the Guarantors hereunder, by way of subrogation, reimbursement, restitution, contribution or otherwise, and will not prove any such claim in competition with the Administrative Agent or any Lender in respect of any payment hereunder in any bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization case or proceedings of any nature; the Guarantors will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against the Company in respect of any liability of the Guarantors to the Company (with respect to such claim); and the Guarantors waive any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantors under the other provisions of this Guaranty.
 
6.2        . 
Subordination
The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of the Company for money borrowed or credit received now or hereafter owed to the Guarantors is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Obligations.  Each of the Guarantors agrees that, after the occurrence of any Event of Default, such Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of the Company to such Guarantor until all of the Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Guarantors shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantors under the other provisions of this Guaranty.
