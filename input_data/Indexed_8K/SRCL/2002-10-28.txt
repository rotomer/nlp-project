ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS On October 19, 2002, Stericycle, Inc. (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sharps Acquisition Corporation ("Merger Sub"), entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Scherer Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Scherer"). Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Scherer, and upon completion of the merger, Scherer will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The total merger consideration payable by the Company will be $41.5 million in cash. In the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Scherer's common stock will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $8.57, and each issued and outstanding share of Scherer's preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $100.00 together with an amount equal to the cumulative dividends, if any, on the share. In addition, all outstanding options to purchase Scherer common stock will be canceled, and each canceled option will represent the right to receive upon completion of the merger a cash payment in an amount equal to the option spread (i.e., the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of $8.57 per share over the exercise price per share payable under the option), less any required withholding taxes. The merger is subject to the approval of Scherer's common stockholders, customary closing conditions and regulatory reviews, including approval of the merger by the New York City Business Integrity Commission. In connection with the merger agreement, Robert P. Scherer, Jr., Scherer's chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer, entered into a voting agreement with the Company and Merger Sub pursuant to which Mr. Scherer agreed to vote the shares of Scherer common stock over which he as voting power in favor of the merger. Mr. Scherer has sole voting power over shares representing approximately 52.0% of Scherer's outstanding common stock and shared voting power over shares representing approximately 7.7% of Scherer's outstanding common stock. (The party with whom Mr. Scherer shares voting power over these latter shares is not a party to the voting agreement.) Under the voting agreement, Mr. Scherer gave his proxy to the Company's president and CEO and its chief financial officer to vote the shares subject to the voting agreement at the special meeting of Scherer's common stockholders to be held for the purpose of voting on the proposed merger. The voting agreement terminates automatically in certain events, including the termination of the merger agreement or if the merger agreement becomes terminable pursuant to specified sections of the merger agreement. In addition, Mr. Scherer entered into a three-year consulting agreement with the Company, pursuant to which the Company will pay Mr. Scherer $225,000 upon completion of the merger. Mr. Scherer also entered into a five-year noncompetition agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company will pay Mr. Scherer $195,000 per year during the term of the agreement. These two agreements do not become effective until completion of the merger. Copies of the merger agreement, voting agreement, consulting agreement and noncompetition agreement are filed as exhibits to this Report. -2-

The Merger shall have the effects described in Section 259 of the DGCL.

(b) CORPORATE ORGANIZATION As of the Effective Time, Company's certificate of incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended in its entirety as attached hereto as EXHIBIT A, and as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time, the bylaws, directors and officers of MergerSub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws, directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation. (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY SHARES At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Stockholder or any holder of capital stock of Parent or MergerSub, each Company Share shall be converted into the right to receive an amount (the "Merger Consideration"), payable upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing the share pursuant to Section 2.5(b), as follows: (1) each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than a Dissenting Share or a share held in treasury by Company) shall be converted into the right to receive, in cash (without interest), an amount per share equal to the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, and all such shares of Company Preferred Stock shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist; and (2) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than a Dissenting Share or a share held in treasury by Company) shall be converted into the right to receive, in cash (without interest), an amount per share equal to the Common Stock Merger Consideration, and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. (d) COMPANY TREASURY SHARES At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Stockholder or any holder of capital stock of Parent or MergerSub, each share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held in treasury by Company shall be automatically canceled and cease to exist, and no payment of Merger Consideration shall be made in respect of the share.

2.5 EXCHANGE FUND AND PROCEDURES (a) EXCHANGE FUND Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Company Shares for Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of Company Shares and Company Stock Options, cash sufficient in the aggregate for the Paying Agent to make full payment of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and any amounts payable pursuable to Section 2.5(i) (net of any required withholding of taxes). This deposit shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from the investment shall be Parent's sole and exclusive property and shall be paid to Parent upon demand. No part of such interest or income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Shares. (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to mail to each registered holder of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such other provisions as Parent reasonably may require (a "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for surrendering the stock certificate or certificates representing the holder's Company Shares (each a "Company Stock Certificate") in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the holder's certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Proxy Statement shall provide that, in lieu of delivery following the Effective Time as aforesaid, and commencing on the tenth (10th) calendar day prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, the Letter of Transmittal and instructions for use will be promptly delivered by the Paying Agent to each prior holder of Company Shares from whom the Paying Agent receives a written request therefor prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, and that each such prior holder of Company Shares shall be entitled thereafter to surrender its Company Stock Certificate in accordance with the procedures described herein, in the Letter of Transmittal and in the accompanying instructions, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to comply with the foregoing. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with its instructions and such other documents as the Paying Agent reasonably may require, the Paying Agent shall pay to the holder of the surrendered certificate, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares represented by the certificate, and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. The Letter of Transmittal shall provide that such payment shall, at the holder's election and upon delivery of wire transfer instructions, be by wire -4-
transfer at the Company's expense for payments exceeding $1,000,000. If any portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of any Company Shares is to be paid to a Person other than the registered holder of those shares, it shall be a condition to making such payment that the Company Stock Certificate representing those shares is surrendered properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall (i) pay any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of payment to a Person other than the registered holder or (ii) establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. At and after the Effective Time and until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(b), each Company Stock Certificate (other than Company Stock Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held in treasury to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.4(d) shall be deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable upon such surrender. (c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS From and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights in respect of those shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. The Merger Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights in respect of those shares. (d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining undistributed nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or as the Surviving Corporation directs, and thereafter any holder of Company Shares who did not comply with this Article 2 prior to such delivery shall look, solely to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of those shares (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws). (e) NO LIABILITY None of Parent, MergerSub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or other distributions respect thereto), or cash from the Exchange Fund, delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (f) LOST CERTIFICATES Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a "lost certificate" affidavit in customary form to the effect that a Company Stock Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, delivery of a bond in such -5-
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation in respect of the certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Person claiming ownership of the lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares previously represented by the certificate. (g) STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS Company's stock transfer books shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on Company's stock transfer records. (h) APPRAISAL RIGHTS Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until the Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses those rights. At the Effective Time, each Dissenting Share shall be canceled and cease to exist or be outstanding, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of the shares is accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise forfeits the right to appraisal under Section 262, the right of such Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to exist and such Dissenting Stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have converted into and represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing those shares pursuant to Section 2.5(b). Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal of any Company Shares, any attempted withdrawal of any such demand, and any other instrument served on the Company pursuant to the DGCL relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to consult with respect to all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Company shall not voluntarily make any payment in respect of, or settle or offer to settle, any demand for appraisal without Parent's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. (i) STOCK OPTIONS Company shall take all action necessary so that each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or not it is then vested or exercisable, shall be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent (whether or not previously vested) only the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, in consideration for the option's cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock -6-
issuable upon exercise of the option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share payable under the option, (with the amount payable subject to reduction for required withholding of taxes). Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable) a letter in a form acceptable to Parent describing the treatment of and payment for Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.5(i) and providing instructions to use to obtain payment for the holder's Company Stock Options under this Agreement. These instructions shall require, inter alia, that as a condition of payment, the holder shall be required to deliver a release, in a form acceptable to Parent, by which the holder effectively relinquishes all rights in respect of the holder's Company Stock Options upon payment in accordance with this Section 2.5(i). The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent, at the Effective Time or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, to deliver to such holder the amount of cash provided for in the first sentence of this Section 2.5(i). Company shall take all actions necessary to cause all stock option, stock grant and stock purchase plans, and any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to equity securities of Company or any Subsidiary, to be terminated effective as of the Effective Time and to ensure that no Person shall have any rights thereunder to acquire equity securities of Company, any Subsidiary, Parent or the Surviving Corporation after such time.

Company's board of directors shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by Company's Stockholders and, except as permitted by Section 5.7(c), shall not withdraw, amend, or modify their respective recommendations in a manner adverse to Parent (or announce publicly its intention to do so).

Each of the Company and Parent shall use its best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Authority may assert with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with the Required Regulatory Approvals. In the event that a suit is instituted by a Person or Governmental Authority challenging this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of applicable antitrust or competition laws, each of the Company and Parent shall use its best efforts to resist or resolve such suit. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may reasonably be necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, ruling request, notice or application made by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 5.5 ACCESS TO INFORMATION Pending Closing, Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to (i) give Parent and its representatives (including counsel, financial advisors and accountants) access during normal business hours (but without unreasonable interference with operations) to its Facilities and Books and Records and other documents and (ii) make its officers and employees available to respond to reasonable inquiries regarding the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Business. Company shall furnish Parent and its representatives with all information and copies of all documents concerning the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Business, and the Company Shares and Company Options, that Parent and its representatives reasonably request.

any of the conditions in Section 6.1 or 6.2 impossible or unlikely; but the delivery of any Notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the rights, obligations or remedies available to any Party under this Agreement. 5.7 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS (a) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company shall, and shall cause its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties previously conducted in respect of any possible Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.7, Company's board of directors and the Special Committee shall not approve or recommend to stockholders any Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure to Company's Stockholders which, in the good faith reasonable judgment of Company's board of directors, is required under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any action by Company's board of directors or the Special Committee permitted by, and taken in accordance with, this Section 5.7 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by Company. -28-
(d) In the event Company receives a Superior Company Proposal, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company's board of directors, the Special Committee or an Authorized Officer of the Company from executing or entering into an agreement relating to such Superior Company Proposal and recommending such Superior Company Proposal to the Stockholders; and in such case, Company's board of directors may withdraw, modify or refrain from making its recommendation (including a declaration of advisability) of the Merger and/or adoption of this Agreement, and, to the extent it does so, Company may refrain from calling, providing notice of and holding the Stockholders Meeting to adopt this Agreement and from soliciting proxies or consents to secure the vote or written consent of its stockholders to adopt this Agreement and may terminate this Agreement. 5.8 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Each of Parent, Subsidiary and Company shall consult with one another before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as required by Law or the rules of The Nasdaq National Market, Inc. 5.9 EMPLOYEE MATTERS Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the obligations of each Target Company under the provisions of each Employee Benefit Plan listed on Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and all written employment Contracts referred to on Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to Parent's right to amend or terminate any such benefit plan or employee Contract in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that Parent shall not amend or terminate any such benefit plan prior to the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Date unless the Employee Benefit Plans of Parent in which the employees of the Target Companies are eligible to participate provide for benefits which, in the aggregate, are substantially equal to or greater than those provided under the plans listed on Schedule 3.16(a). After the Effective Time, the employees of each Target Company shall be eligible to participate in the Employee Benefit Plans of Parent in accordance with their respective terms of participation, as such plans may be in effect from time to time, and at Parent's sole discretion, such employees may become employees of Parent. Service with any Target Company will be counted for purposes of determining periods of eligibility to participate or to vest in benefits under any applicable Employee Benefit Plan of Parent. At Parent's sole discretion, administrative functions, including but not limited to payroll processing, may be transferred to processors of Parent's choosing. 5.10 FEES AND EXPENSES If the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the legal, financial advisory and accounting fees and expenses of Company in addition to such other reasonable and customary expenses incurred by Company (including, but not limited to, the printing, filing and -29-

Each Covered Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent and Surviving Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Parent from the Covered Party of a request therefore; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Covered Party, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 9.1 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 9.2 CERTAIN RECORDS Parent shall permit the Stockholders designated by Company prior to the Effective Time (but no more than five (5) in number) to retain copies of (i) all records and correspondence of Company relating to any proposed sale, merger or similar transaction involving Company, including any bids received from potential acquirors and analyses relating to Parent, and (ii) any other material records of Company, including Tax returns, reports or forms filed on Company's behalf for a valid purpose at the sole cost of such persons. 9.3 PERFORMANCE BY MERGERSUB Parent shall cause MergerSub prior to the Effective Time to comply with its obligations hereunder and shall, subject to the terms herein, cause MergerSub to consummate the Merger as contemplated herein and whenever prior to the Effective Time this Agreement requires MergerSub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking of Parent to cause MergerSub to take such action. -36-

EXHIBIT 99.3 NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT This Agreement is entered into as of October 19, 2002 by Stericycle, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Robert P. Scherer, Jr., a Georgia resident ("Officer"). Background: A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, Sharps Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerSub"), and Scherer Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), have entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement"). B. The Merger Agreement contemplates a transaction (the "Merger") in which Parent will acquire all of Company's outstanding capital stock for cash through a reverse merger of MergerSub with and into Company. C. Officer has been chairman of the board of directors of Company and Company's chief executive officer since February 1995, its president since May 1998 and a director since 1977. He is also a principal stockholder of Company. D. In view of Officer's knowledge, experience, judgment and access to substantial financial resources, Parent wants assurances that Officer will not directly or indirectly compete with Parent following consummation of the Merger. Officer is willing to provide these assurances on the following terms. Now, therefore, in consideration of their mutual promises and intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows: 1. DEFINITIONS Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined either in this Agreement or in the attached EXHIBIT A. Any capitalized term used in this Agreement or in EXHIBIT A without being so defined has the same meaning that it has in the Merger Agreement (which, solely for this purpose, is incorporated in this Agreement by reference). 2. EFFECTIVE DATE (a) This Agreement shall not be effective until the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, this Agreement shall become effective automatically, without the necessity of any further action by either Party. (The date on which this Agreement becomes effective is the "Effective Date.")
(b) Pending consummation of the Merger, neither Party may unilaterally terminate, revoke, modify or amend this Agreement. This Agreement shall be terminated automatically, without the necessity of any further action by either Party, and without any liability of any kind on the part of either Party, if the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms. 3. NONCOMPETITION COVENANT (a) During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Covenant Period"), Officer shall not directly or indirectly do any of the following things, regardless of the Capacity in which Officer is acting (these restrictions on Officer constituting his "Noncompetition Covenant"): (1) accept employment with, engage in, acquire any form of financial interest in, or render compensated or uncompensated advisory or other services to any Competing Business (but this restriction shall not apply to Officer's direct or indirect beneficial ownership of not more than 2% of the issued and outstanding stock of any corporation whose stock is available to the general public on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market System); (2) solicit or attempt to solicit for a Competing Business any customer or account of or with which a Target Company did business at any time during the three-year period ending on the Effective Date; and (3) solicit for employment or hire away any employee of a Target Company, or any employee of Parent or another Parent Subsidiary who is an employee of a Target Company, regardless of whether the employee is full-time, part-time or temporary, or is employed on an "at will" basis or pursuant to a written agreement. (b) The duration of the Covenant Period shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of any period of violation of Officer's Noncompetition Covenant. (c) As provided in Paragraph 5(c), the duration of the Covenant Period may be reduced by any court of competent jurisdiction in which Parent seeks to enforce the Noncompetition Covenant to the maximum period that the court considers reasonable in light of the circumstances in which the Parties entered into this Agreement. 4. PAYMENTS (a) In consideration of Officer's Noncompetition Covenant, Parent shall pay Officer as follows: (1) Parent will pay $195,000 to Officer on the Effective Date; and -2-
(2) Parent will pay $195,000 to Officer on each of the first (1st) through fourth (4th) anniversaries of the Effective Date (or on the last business day preceding the first (1st) through fourth (4th) anniversaries, as the case may be, if any such anniversary date is not a business day). (b) If Parent fails to make any payment described in Paragraph 4(a) (a "Payment") when due, interest shall accrue on the delinquent amount until paid at a fluctuating rate equal at all times to three percent (3%) above the rate of interest that Bank of America, N.A. announces as its prime or equivalent rate of interest (the "Prime Rate"). (c) If Parent fails to make any Payment when due, and the default continues for fifteen (15) days after Officer gives Notice of the default to Parent, Officer may accelerate the remaining Payments and declare them to be immediately due and payable, by Notice of acceleration given to Parent. Interest shall accrue on the accelerated amount until paid at a fluctuating rate equal at all times to three percent (3%) above the Prime Rate. Officer's acceleration of the remaining Payments shall not terminate his Noncompetition Covenant. (d) In the event of Officer's death prior to the expiration of the Covenant Period, Parent shall make the remaining Payments, when it would have made them to Officer, to Officer's estate or as Officer may have directed otherwise in the last Notice of directions that Parent received from Officer prior to his death. (e) If there has been a breach by Officer of the Noncompetition Covenant, which is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given by Parent to Officer, Parent shall not be required to make any Payment to Officer payable to Officer after Officer has violated the Noncompetition Covenant. (f) All amounts payable by Parent to Officer under this Paragraph 4 shall be paid by wire transfers to the bank account designated by Officer in wire transfer instructions delivered to Parent no later than two (2) business days prior to the Effective Date (as Officer may change these instructions by Notice to Parent). 5. ENFORCEMENT OF NONCOMPETITION COVENANT (a) The Parties stipulate and agree that any violation by Officer of the Noncompetition Covenant would result in immediate and irreparable injury and harm to Parent unless injunctive relief were granted, and that money damages for the violation would be both difficult to determine and inadequate to compensate Parent for its injury. (b) Officer accordingly agrees that in the event that he violates his Noncompetition Covenant, Parent shall be entitled to obtain a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent Officer's continued violation, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or security. This -3-
right to injunctive relief shall be in addition to the right to terminate payments under Paragraph 4(e) and any other remedies to which Parent may be entitled. If Parent prevails in its lawsuit against Officer, Officer shall pay Parent's attorneys' fees and court costs in prosecuting its lawsuit. (c) Officer stipulates and agrees that if the court in which Parent seeks injunctive relief determines that the Noncompetition Covenant is too broad in scope or territorial application to be legally valid and enforceable, or that the duration of the Noncompetition Covenant is too long to be legally valid and enforceable, the scope, area or duration may be reduced to limits that the court considers reasonable and, as so reduced, the restriction may be enforced against Officer. 6. NOTICES Each notice or other communication under this Agreement (a "Notice") shall be in writing and sent by certified or registered mail, overnight messenger service, personal delivery or facsimile transmission, as follows: (a) if to Parent, to: Stericycle, Inc. 21861 North Keith Drive Lake Forest, Illinois 60045 Attention: Mr. Mark C.

Any severed provision of this Agreement shall be judicially modified to the minimum extent necessary in order to render it valid, legal and enforceable while accomplishing the intent of the provision as nearly as may be practicable. 8. GOVERNING LAW (a) This Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Illinois, where Parent's principal executive offices are located, without regard to Illinois conflicts of law principles. Officer acknowledges that Parent believes that the Noncompetition Covenant may be more readily enforced under Illinois Law than under Georgia Law; and in order to provide additional assurance to Parent, Officer has agreed, despite Officer's residence in the State of Georgia, to the application of Illinois Law to the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement.
