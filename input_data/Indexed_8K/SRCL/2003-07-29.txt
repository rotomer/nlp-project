Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 29, 2003 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
The income statement accompanying the press release shows EBITDA for the second quarter. EBITDA is calculated as the sum of net income, plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense. We consider EBITDA to be a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is not calculated in the same way by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBITDA is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. The funds depicted by this measure may not be available for management's discretionary use due to legal or functional requirements, debt service, other commitments and uncertainties.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.

SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 were $113.1 million, up 14.0% from $99.3 million in the same quarter last year. International equipment sales contributed $0.4 million in revenues for the quarter as compared to $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2002. Revenues excluding international equipment sales increased 14.8% over the same period in 2002. Gross profit was $48.8 million, up 21.4% from $40.2 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 43.2% from 40.5% in the second quarter of 2002.
Net income for the second quarter of 2003 rose 34.7% to $15.5 million, up from $11.5 million in the second quarter of 2002.
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2003 were $0.34, up 29.5% from $0.26 in the second quarter of 2002. Weighted shares outstanding used to determine earnings per diluted share were 46,105,360 for the second quarter of 2003 and 45,146,640 for the second quarter of 2002.
For the six months ended June 30, 2003, revenues increased to $225.4 million, an increase of 14.8% from the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 42.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2003 from 40.3% for the same period in 2002. Earnings per share increased 34.1% to $0.66 from $0.49 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.
As previously reported on May 27, 2003, we repurchased $6.6 million of our 12-3/8% senior subordinated bonds. We repurchased an additional $2.0 million of our 12-3/8% senior subordinated bonds on June 30, 2003. The total redemption premium to repurchase the $8.6 million senior subordinated bonds was a pre-tax charge of $1.4 million and the write-off of associated deferred financing fees was a pretax charge of $0.2 million. On an after-tax basis, the charges totaled approximately $1.0 million or $0.02 per diluted share.
During the second quarter of 2003, we continued to improve our balance sheet position. Our total debt to capitalization percentage ratio improved from 39.1% at December 31, 2002 to 34.1% at June 30, 2003.
Miller said, "During the quarter we continued to execute our proven business model and reported strong sales growth and record income from operations. The cash flow of $59.8 million generated from operations for the first six months of the year, was used to strengthen the business by repurchasing senior subordinated bonds, paying down the senior bank debt and investing in the company's future."
Stericycle provides medical waste collection, transportation, treatment and disposal services and safety and compliance programs to healthcare companies nationwide, including hospitals, physician and dental offices, laboratories and clinics. Medical waste includes single-use disposables such as needles, syringes, gloves and other supplies that have been in contact with blood or other bodily fluids, as well as blood, blood products and other items that could harbor infectious agents.
Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond Stericycle's control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. The Company makes no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
