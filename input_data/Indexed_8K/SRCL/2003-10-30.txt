Miller said, "During the quarter we continued to execute our proven business model, generating strong sales growth and record income from operations. The cash flow of $88.3 million generated from operations for the first nine months of the year, was used to strengthen the business by repurchasing senior subordinated bonds, paying down the senior bank debt and investing in the company's future."

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 30, 2003 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
The income statement accompanying the press release shows EBITDA for the third quarter. EBITDA is calculated as the sum of net income, plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense. We consider EBITDA to be a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's operating performance and ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is not calculated in the same way by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBITDA is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. The funds depicted by this measure may not be available for management's discretionary use due to legal or functional requirements, debt service, other commitments and uncertainties.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.
Dated: October 30, 2003
