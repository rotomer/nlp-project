Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 10, 2004 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.
Dated: February 10, 2004

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 were $114.6 million, up 11.0% from $103.2 million in the same quarter last year. International equipment related sales contributed $1.5 million in revenues for the quarter as compared to $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross profit was $51.1 million, up 18.0% from $43.3 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 44.6% from 42.0% in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 rose 61.0% to $18.4 million, up from $11.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Included in the 2002 results was a non-cash write off of fixed assets which reduced net income by $1.8 million.
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $0.40, up 59.0% from $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2002. Weighted shares outstanding used to determine earnings per diluted share were 46,311,916 for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 45,392,538 for the fourth quarter of 2002.
For the year ended December 31, 2003, revenues increased to $453.2 million, up 12.9% from $401.5 million for the prior year. International equipment related sales contributed $2.8 million in revenues for the year as compared to $6.4 million in 2002. Gross profit was $196.6 million, up 19.5% from $164.5 million in 2002. Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 43.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 41.0% for the prior period. Earnings per share increased 41.3% to $1.43 from $1.01 per diluted share in 2002.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the company continued to improve its balance sheet position. Our total debt to capitalization percentage ratio improved from 39.1% at December 31, 2002 to 28.1% at December 31, 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we reduced debt by $11.9 million and repurchased $13.2 million of company stock.
Miller said, "During the quarter we continued to execute our proven business model, generating strong sales growth and record income from operations. The cash flow of $121.1 million generated for the full year was used to strengthen the business by funding acquisitions, paying down our senior bank debt, repurchasing senior subordinated bonds, investing in the company's future and repurchasing company stock."
Stericycle provides medical waste collection, transportation, treatment and disposal services and safety and compliance programs to healthcare companies nationwide, including hospitals, physician and dental offices, laboratories and clinics. Medical waste includes single-use disposables such as needles, syringes, gloves and other supplies that have been in contact with blood or other bodily fluids, as well as blood, blood products and other items that could harbor infectious agents.
Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond Stericycle's control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. The Company makes no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
