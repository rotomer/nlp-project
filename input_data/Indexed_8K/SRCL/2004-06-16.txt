The remaining provisions of this clause 5 and clause 8 (in respect of set off against the Loan Notes) shall apply in relation to the payment of monies out of the Escrow Account in relation to any Settled or Unagreed Claims. 5.2 Provided that there are no unsatisfied Settled Claims or Unagreed Claims on the Repayment Date, the balance (if any) in the Escrow Account (less if applicable any amount remaining in the Escrow Account pending Settlement of the Net Asset Value) shall be paid to the Warrantors. 5.3 The Purchaser and the Warrantors shall procure that there shall be paid out of the Escrow Account the amount of any Settled Claim within five Business Days of any claim becoming a Settled Claim and the amount of such payment shall pro tanto satisfy the liability concerned. 5.4 If there are any outstanding Unagreed Claims on the Repayment Date then the aggregate amount of all such claims as estimated either by Queen's Counsel selected by the Purchaser in its reasonable discretion and at its cost or by the Purchaser itself (as the case may be) shall remain in the Escrow Account until such time as the relevant Unagreed Claims become Settled Claims and the amount (if any) by which the amount in the Escrow Account exceeds the estimated amount of the Unagreed Claims shall be paid to the Warrantors. When the Unagreed Claims become Settled Claims, the amount of the Settled Claims shall be paid to the Purchaser and the amount of such payment shall pro tanto satisfy the liability concerned and the balance of the amount retained in the Escrow Account in respect of the relevant claims (if any) shall be paid to the Warrantors. If the Purchaser does not obtain an opinion of Queen's Counsel that an outstanding Unagreed Claim is likely to succeed and Queen's Counsel's best estimate of the claim, then the Purchaser shall pay interest on the 15
excess (if any) of the amount retained in the Escrow Account in respect of the Unagreed Claim over the amount of the Settled Claim when the Unagreed Claim becomes a Settled Claim. The rate of interest payable on such excess shall be 5 per cent per annum over the base rate of Barclays Bank PLC and shall accrue from day to day from the Repayment Date to the date of payment and be paid within five Business Days after the Unagreed Claim becomes a Settled Claim. The amount of interest otherwise payable by the Purchaser shall be reduced by the interest paid or payable to the Warrantors under clause 5.5 in respect of the excess for the period from the Repayment Date to the date of the Purchaser's payment of interest on the excess. 5.5 Any interest earned on the money in the Escrow Account shall be due and paid to the party entitled to the relevant amount of principal. 5.6 All amounts payable to the Warrantors from the Escrow Account, pursuant to clause 3.3, this clause 5 and clause 8 shall be paid to the Vendors' Solicitors by electronic funds transfer whose receipt shall be sufficient discharge for such sum and the Purchaser shall not be concerned to see the application thereof. 6. WARRANTIES 6.1 As at the date of this agreement, the Warrantors severally warrant to the Purchaser in the terms set out in schedule 3 and part 2 of schedule 4. 6.2 Each of the Warranties shall be construed as a separate and independent warranty and (except where this agreement provides otherwise) shall not be limited or restricted by any other Warranty. 6.3 The rights and remedies of the Purchaser in respect of any breach of any of the Warranties shall survive Completion. 6.4 Except in respect of any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or omission which has been made fraudulently each of the Vendors waives and may not enforce any right which he may have in respect of any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or omission in or from any information or advice supplied or given by the Group or its officers or employees in enabling the Vendors to enter this agreement, give the Warranties or to prepare the Disclosure Letter. 6.5 The Warranties are given subject to matters Disclosed. 16
6.6 The Purchaser acknowledges and represents to the Vendors that it has not relied on any representations or warranties made by the Vendors or on their behalf by any person other than those included in this Agreement or any other agreement entered into pursuant to or for the purposes of this Agreement. 6.7 The Purchaser's sole remedy in the event of any breach of any warranty, undertaking or covenant in this agreement or the Tax Covenant or any other agreement to be entered into pursuant to or for the purposes of this agreement shall be in damages for breach of contract and (for the avoidance of doubt) the Purchaser shall have no right to rescind or terminate this agreement or any such other agreement after Completion. 6.8 The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in entering into this Agreement, and the documents referred to in it, it does not rely on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, warranty or understanding (whether negligently or innocently made) of any person (whether party to this agreement or not) other than as expressly set out in this agreement as a Warranty. Nothing in this clause shall, however, operate to limit or exclude any liability for fraud. 6.9 The provisions of schedule 8 shall have effect in respect of the Vendors' liability under this agreement; 6.10 No representations, Warranties, indemnities or other assurance or comfort whatsoever are given under this agreement in favour of the Purchaser in relation to the state and repair of the incinerators operated by members of the Group and no representations, Warranties, indemnities or other statements (whether written or oral) made under or in connection with this agreement shall be construed so as to relate to such matters and the Purchaser will be deemed to have relied exclusively on their own investigations of all such matters provided that the state and repair of the incinerators may be used as evidence of breach of the Warranty in paragraph 6.9 of schedule 3. 6.11 Except as set out in paragraph 20 of schedule 3, no representations, Warranties indemnities or other assurance or comfort whatsoever are given under this agreement in favour of the Purchaser in relation to environmental matters and no representations, Warranties, indemnities or other statements (whether written or oral) made under or in connection with this agreement shall be construed so as to relate to such matters and the Purchaser will be deemed to have relied exclusively on their investigations of all such matters. 17
6.12 Except as set out in part 2 of schedule 3, no representations, Warranties indemnities or other assurance or comfort whatsoever are given under this agreement in favour of the Purchaser in relation to the Properties and no representations, Warranties, indemnities or other statements (whether written or oral) made under or in connection with this agreement shall be construed so as to relate to such matters and save as set out in part 2 of schedule 3 the Purchaser will be deemed to have relied exclusively on their investigations of all such matters. 7. WARRANTORS' COVENANTS 7.1 Each of the Warrantors severally undertakes to and covenants with the Purchaser that (except with the consent in writing of the Purchaser) he will not at any time after Completion: 7.1.1 use or procure or cause or (so far as he is able) permit the use of any name or names identical or similar to or including the words "White Rose Environmental" or "Sharpsmart" or any of the names or names identical or similar to the Subsidiaries or any colourable imitation thereof in connection with any activity whatsoever; 7.1.2 (except as required by law) disclose or divulge to any person (other than to officers or employees of the Purchaser whose province it is to know the same) or use (other than for the benefit of the Purchaser) any Confidential Information which may be within or have come to his knowledge; 7.1.3 do or say anything which is intended to damage the goodwill or reputation of the Company or any other member of the Group or of any business carried on by any member of the Group. 7.2 Each of the Warrantors severally undertakes to and covenants with the Purchaser that he will not, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Purchaser, for a period of three years after the date of this agreement, either on his own behalf or jointly with or as an officer, manager, employee, adviser, consultant or agent for any other person, directly or indirectly: 7.2.1 approach, canvass, solicit or otherwise act with a view to enticing away from or seeking in competition with any business of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries the custom of any person who at any time during the period of 18
12 months preceding the Completion Date or at any time thereafter prior to his ceasing to be employed by the Company is or has been a customer of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and during such period he shall not use his knowledge of or influence over any such customer to or for his own benefit or the benefit of any other person carrying on business in competition with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or otherwise use his knowledge of or influence over any such customer to the detriment of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; 7.2.2 approach, canvass, solicit, engage or employ or otherwise endeavour to entice away or aid or assist any other person or persons in employing or otherwise retaining the services of any person who at any time during the period of 12 months preceding the Completion Date has been an employee (other than in a junior administrative or secretarial capacity), officer, manager, consultant, sub-contractor or agent of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries with a view to the specific knowledge or skills of such person being used by or for the benefit of any person carrying on business in competition with the business carried on by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; 7.2.3 be engaged, concerned or interested, whether as an employee or in any other capacity, in any business concern within Great Britain which is involved in (i) the handling, collection, transportation, transfer, processing, storage, treatment or disposal of clinical waste or (ii) any other business in which any Group member was engaged at any time during the period of 24 months prior to the Completion Date. 7.3 Each of the covenants contained in clauses 7.1 and 7.2 shall constitute an entirely separate and independent restriction on each of the Warrantors. 7.4 Nothing in this clause 7 shall prohibit any of the Warrantors from directly or indirectly holding shares or stock quoted or dealt in on a recognised investment exchange (as defined in the FSMA) so long as not more than one per cent per Warrantor or five per cent on aggregate of the shares or stock of any class of any one company is so held. 19
7.5 The Warrantors and each of them agree and acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this clause 7 are fair and reasonable and necessary to assure to the Purchaser the full value and benefit of the Shares but, in the event that any such restriction shall be found to be void or unenforceable but would be valid and effective if some part or parts thereof were deleted, such restriction shall apply with such deletion as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. 7.6 If a breach of this clause 7 occurs, the Warrantors and the Purchaser agree that damages alone are likely not to be sufficient compensation and that injunctive relief is reasonable and is likely to be essential to safeguard the interests of the Purchaser and of any member of the Group and that injunctive relief (in addition to any other equitable remedies) may (subject to the discretion of the courts) be obtained. 8. SET OFF AGAINST LOAN NOTES 8.1 In the event that there is a Settled Claim which is not satisfied by a payment out of the Escrow Account pursuant to clause 5, the Purchaser shall be entitled to set off the amount of such Settled Claim against the Loan Notes by cancellation of a relevant amount thereof, in accordance with the provisions of condition 7.1 of schedule 2 of the Loan Notes, the amount of such set off being apportioned between the Warrantors in the proportions set out in column 5 of schedule 1. 8.2 If there are any outstanding Unagreed Claims on the redemption date of the Loan Notes, the Purchaser may withhold payment of a pro rata portion of each Loan Note (determined by reference to the proportions set out in column 5 of schedule 1) equal in the aggregate to the aggregate amount of all such outstanding Unagreed Claims as estimated either by Queen's Counsel selected by the Purchaser in its reasonable discretion and at its cost or by the Purchaser itself (as the case may be) if, and only if, within five Business Days after the redemption date of the Loan Notes, the Purchaser deposits the entire amount withheld into the Escrow Account by electronic funds transfer. The amount deposited shall remain in the Escrow Account until such time as the relevant Unagreed Claims become Settled Claims. When the said Unagreed Claims become Settled Claims, the amount of the Settled Claims shall be paid to the Purchaser and the amount of such payment shall pro tanto satisfy the liability concerned and the balance (if any) of the amount deposited in the Escrow Account in respect of the relevant claims shall be paid to the Warrantors in the proportions set out in column 5 of schedule 1. If the Purchaser does not obtain an opinion of Queen's 20
Counsel that an outstanding Unagreed Claim is likely to succeed and Queen's Counsel's best estimate of the claim, then the Purchaser shall pay interest on the excess (if any) of the amount deposited into the Escrow Account in respect of the Unagreed Claim over the amount of the Settled Claim when the Unagreed Claim becomes a Settled Claim. The rate of interest payable on such excess shall be 5 per cent per annum over the base rate of Barclays Bank PLC and shall accrue from day to day from the redemption date of the Loan Notes to the date of payment and be paid within five Business Days after the Unagreed Claim becomes a Settled Claim. The amount of interest otherwise payable by the Purchaser shall be reduced by the interest paid or payable to the Warrantors under clause 5.5 in respect of the excess for the period from the redemption date of the Loan Notes to the date of the Purchaser's payment of interest on the excess. 9. TAXATION The provisions of schedule 4 shall apply with respect to the matters contained or referred to therein. 10. FURTHER ASSURANCE AND ATTORNEY 10.1 On and after Completion, the Vendors shall, at the request of the Purchaser, do and execute or procure to be done and executed all such acts, deeds, documents and things as may be necessary to give effect to this agreement. 10.2 Each of the Vendors hereby irrevocably appoints the Purchaser as its true and lawful attorney pending the Purchaser's registration as a member of the Company for a period of three months after the date of this agreement generally in respect of the Shares and in particular to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company and with power on that Vendor's behalf to execute and deliver all deeds and documents and to do all acts and things and exercise all rights which the Purchaser would be entitled to execute, deliver and do and exercise if the Purchaser was registered as the holder of the Shares with power to sub-delegate this power. 10.3 Each of the Vendors agrees that, for so long as any Shares remain registered in his name, he will: 10.3.1 not exercise any of his rights as a member of the Company or appoint any other person to exercise such rights; 21
10.3.2 hold on trust for and pay or deliver to the Purchaser any distributions or notices, documents or other communications which may be received after the date of this agreement by that Vendor, in his capacity as a member of the Company, from the Company or any third party; 10.3.3 on request by the Vendor, ratify all documents executed and acts done by the Vendor as his attorney. 11. ANNOUNCEMENTS No announcement, communication or circular concerning this agreement shall be made (whether before or after the Completion Date) by or on behalf of the parties hereto without the prior approval of the other or others (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) save for such announcements as may be required by law in any jurisdiction or the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 12. COSTS Subject to the provisions of paragraph 6 of part 1 of schedule 7, each of the parties shall bear and pay its own legal, accountancy and other fees and expenses incurred in and incidental to the preparation and implementation of this agreement and of all other documents in the agreed form. 13. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNMENT 13.1 This agreement shall be binding on and enure for the benefit of each party's successors and personal representatives but shall not be assignable except that: 13.1.1 the Purchaser may assign the whole or any part of the benefit of this agreement (either entirely or jointly with itself) to any person providing the Purchaser with finance for the Consideration or to any member of the Purchaser's Group; or 13.1.2 the Purchaser (and any assignee of the Purchaser or of any such assignee) may assign to any person to whom the Purchaser has sold any Shares or any of the assets or businesses of any member of the Group the benefit of the restrictive covenants set out in clause 7. 22
13.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided, all rights and benefits under this agreement are personal to the parties and may not be assigned at law or in equity without the prior written consent of each other party. 14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT 14.1 This agreement (including the schedules to it) and any documents in the agreed form and the Disclosure Letter ("ACQUISITION DOCUMENTS") constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this agreement. 14.2 Except for any misrepresentation or breach of warranty which constitutes fraud: 14.2.1 the Acquisition Documents supersede and extinguish all previous agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter thereof and any representations and warranties previously given or made; 14.2.2 each party acknowledges to the other (and shall execute the Acquisition Documents in reliance on such acknowledgement) that it has not been induced to enter into any such documents by nor relied on any representation or warranty other than the warranties contained in such documents; 14.2.3 each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to rescind this agreement or any other of the Acquisition Documents for any reason whatsoever or to claim damages for any mis-representation; 14.2.4 each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to claim damages by reason of any warranty not set forth in any such document. 14.3 Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees for the purposes of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 that the provisions of this clause 14 are reasonable. 15.

16. WAIVER No waiver by any party to this agreement of any breach or non-fulfilment by any other party to this agreement of any provisions of this agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent or other breach of that or any other provision and no failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy under this agreement shall constitute a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy under this agreement shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of any such right or remedy. 17. AGREEMENT CONTINUES IN FORCE This agreement shall remain in full force and effect so far as concerns any matter remaining to be performed at Completion even though Completion shall have taken place. 18.

SCHEDULE 3 THE WARRANTIES PART 1 GENERAL 1. CAPACITY AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES 1.1 Each Vendor has full power and authority and has taken all action necessary to execute and deliver and to exercise his rights and perform his obligations under this agreement and each of the documents in the agreed form to be executed on or before Completion which constitute valid and binding obligations on each Vendor in accordance with their terms. 1.2 The execution and delivery of, and the performance by each Vendor of his obligations under each of the documents mentioned in paragraph 1.1 above does not require the consent of a third party and will not result in a breach of or entitle any third party to terminate or avoid any agreement, arrangement, order, judgment or decree of any court or any governmental agency to which he is a party or by which it or its assets is bound or from which he benefits. 1.3 The Shares constitute the whole of the allotted and issued share capital of the Company and have been properly allotted and issued. 1.4 The details of the share capital of each member of the Group set out in Schedule 2 are correct. The Company or a Subsidiary is the sole legal and beneficial owner of all the issued shares in each Subsidiary. 1.5 No person has any present, future or contingent right to call for the allotment, conversion or transfer of or to be entered into the register of members as the holder of any share or loan capital of any member of the Group and there is no Encumbrance on, over or affecting the Shares or any of them or the shares in the Subsidiaries or any unissued shares in the capital of the Company and there is no agreement or commitment to give or create any Encumbrance or negotiations which may lead to such an agreement or commitment and no claim has been made by any person to be entitled to an Encumbrance in relation thereto. 31
1.6 Each Vendor is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the number of Shares set out against his name in Schedule 1. 1.7 Each Vendor is entitled to sell and transfer the full legal and beneficial ownership in his Shares to the Purchaser and such sale will not result in any breach of or default under any agreement or other obligation binding upon the Vendors or any of them or any of their respective property. 1.8 Other than this agreement, there is no agreement, arrangement or obligation requiring the creation, allotment, issue, transfer, redemption or repayment of, or the grant to any person of the right (whether conditional or not) to require the allotment, issue, transfer, redemption or repayment of, any shares in the capital of the Company or any Subsidiary (including, without limitation, an option or right of pre-emption or conversion). 1.9 There is no litigation, arbitration, prosecution, administrative or other legal proceedings or dispute in existence or threatened against any of the Vendors in respect of the Shares or the shares in the Subsidiaries or the Vendors' entitlement to dispose of the Shares or the shares in the Subsidiaries and there are no facts known to the Warrantors or any of them which might give rise to any such proceedings or any such dispute. 1.10 None of the Shares have been the subject of a transaction at an undervalue within the meaning of part IX or part VI of the Insolvency Act 1986. 1.11 The Company has not received any notice or any application or notice of any intended application under the provisions of the Companies Acts for the rectification of the register of members of the Company. 1.12 The Company has not exercised nor purported to exercise or claim any lien over the Shares and no call on the Shares is outstanding and all the Shares are fully paid up. 1.13 The Company has not at any time given any financial assistance in connection with the purchase of shares as would fall within the provisions of sections 151 to 157 of the 1985 Act. 32
2.

2.6 No member of the Group has its records, systems, controls, data or information, recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process whether computerised or not) which (including all means of access) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of that member of the Group. 2.7 Save as set out in the notes to the Accounts and in the Previous Accounts such accounts have not been affected by transactions undertaken by any Group member otherwise than in the ordinary course of its business. 3. BANK ACCOUNTS AND INDEBTEDNESS 3.1 In respect of each member of the Group 3.1.1 a statement of all its bank, building society, investment and deposit accounts and of the credit or debit balances on them at the Business Day before the date of this agreement is attached to the Disclosure Letter; 3.1.2 since such statements there have been no payments out of any such accounts; 3.1.3 the total value of the unpresented cheques drawn by it does not exceed(pound)59,456; 3.1.4 it has not incurred any borrowings which it has not repaid or satisfied; 3.1.5 the amount borrowed by it does not exceed any limitation on its borrowing contained in its articles of association or in any debenture or other deed or document binding on it; 3.1.6 it has not received demand for repayment of any borrowing or indebtedness in the nature of borrowing which is repayable on demand, and there has not occurred any event which would entitle (or which with the giving of notice and/or the lapse of time and/or a relevant determination would entitle) any person to require early repayment of any borrowing or indebtedness in the nature of borrowing; 3.1.7 it has no bank overdraft facilities, loan facilities, credit facilities, acceptance credits or other financial facilities outstanding or available to it; 34

The acquisition is expected to add approximately $28 million to this year's revenues, and be approximately $0.02 accretive to earnings per share in 2004, above the $1.70-$1.75 EPS guidance previously provided in the open teleconference on April 28, 2004. In the last fiscal year, White Rose had revenues of approximately $49 million. Mark C. Miller, Stericycle's President and CEO, said, "The acquisition of White Rose Environmental Limited provides Stericycle with a significant presence in the United Kingdom. The completion of this acquisition represents an important step forward in our strategy of developing and expanding our international presence." Andy Hinton, Chairman of the Board of Directors of White Rose Environmental Limited said, "We are pleased to have Stericycle, a well recognized leader in our industry, as the new owner for our employees, customers and suppliers."

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT: Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond Stericycle's control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in
governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements. -2
