Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 28, 2004 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.
Dated: July 28, 2004

Exhibit 99.1

NET INCOME OF $18.9 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER, UP 21.6% FROM YEAR-AGO QUARTER

Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 were $123.8 million, up 9.4% from $113.1 million in the same quarter last year. International equipment sales contributed $2.9 million in revenues compared to $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. Gross profit was $55.3 million, up 13.3% from $48.8 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 44.7% from 43.2% in the second quarter of 2003.
Net income for the second quarter of 2004 rose 21.6% to $18.9 million, up from $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2003.
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2004 were $0.41, up 20.1% from $0.34 in the second quarter of 2003. Without approximately $1.5 million or $0.02 per share in charges related to the write off of select U.S. incineration equipment and to loan amendment fees related to the increase in our senior secured credit facility in connection with our acquisition in June 2004 of White Rose Environmental Limited, earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2004 would have been $0.43.
Weighted shares outstanding used to determine earnings per diluted share were 46,216,242 for the second quarter of 2004 and 46,105,360 for the second quarter of 2003.
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, revenues increased to $241.3 million, up 7.1% from $225.4 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit was $108.5 million, up 13.0% from $96.0 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 45.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2004 from 42.6% for the same period in 2003. Earnings per share increased 24.3% to $0.82 from $0.66 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.
Effective June 1, 2004, we acquired White Rose Environmental Limited, a leading provider of medical waste management services in the United Kingdom, for approximately $52.3 million in cash and $11.5 million in notes. The White Rose Environmental acquisition has been reflected in our financial statements for the second quarter of 2004. In connection with this acquisition, we amended our senior secured credit facility, increasing the revolving credit facility from $105 million to $187 million with the option to increase the facility by a further $18 million. Our total debt to capitalization percentage ratio increased from 28.1% at December 31, 2003 to 31.0% at June 30, 2004.
Miller said, "During the quarter we continued to execute our proven business model, generating strong sales growth and record income from operations. The cash flow from operations of $46.9 million generated from operations for the first months of the year was used to strenghten the business."

Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond Stericycle's control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. The Company makes no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
