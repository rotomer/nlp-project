Item 9.01 Financial Statement and Exhibits
On February 9, 2005 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.
Dated: February 9, 2005

Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 were $138.9 million, up 21.2% from $114.6 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $18 million in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $60.5 million, up 18.4% from $51.1 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 43.6% versus 44.6% in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004, including the charges related to the redemption of our senior subordinated notes, rose 3.5% to $19.1 million, up from $18.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. As we had previously announced we redeemed the remaining $50.1 million of our 12-3/8% senior subordinated notes in November 2004. The redemption premium was a cash pretax charge of $3.1 million, and the accelerated amortization of financing fees associated with the notes was a non-cash pretax charge of $1.1 million. On an after-tax basis, these charges totaled approximately $2.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share.
Earnings per diluted share, including this charge, for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $0.42, up 5.0% from $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Weighted shares outstanding used to determine earnings per diluted share were 45,858,482 for the fourth quarter of 2004 and 46,311,916 for the fourth quarter of 2003.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, revenues increased to $516.2 million, up 13.9% from $453.2 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit was $228.2 million, up 16.1% from $196.6 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to 44.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 43.4% for the same period in 2003. Earnings per diluted share, including $0.06 in charges related to the redemption of our senior subordinated notes, increased 18.2% to $1.69 from $1.43 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.
Our total debt to capitalization percentage ratio at December 31, 2004 was 29.1% versus 28.1% at December 31, 2003.
Miller said, "During the year, we continued to execute our proven business model, generating strong sales growth and record income from operations. With a strong balance sheet, the cash flow from operations of $114.6 million for the year was used to strengthen the business and funded $72.4 million in acquistions, $33.2 million in capital spending, and $34.8 million ($24.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004) in stock repurchases."

Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. The Company makes no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
