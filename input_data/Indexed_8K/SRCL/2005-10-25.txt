Item 9.01 Financial Statement and Exhibits
On October 25, 2005 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.
Dated: October 25, 2005

Exhibit 99.1
October 25, 2005

Lake Forest, Illinois, October 25, 2005
Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
THIRD QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 were $153.2 million, up 12.6% from $136.0 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $7.4 million in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $67.6 million, up 14.2% from $59.2 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.1% versus 43.5% in the third quarter of 2004.
Net income for the third quarter of 2005 rose 10.7% to $23.4 million, up from $21.1 million in the third quarter of 2004.
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2005 were $0.52, up 13.0% from $0.46 in the third quarter of 2004. Weighted shares outstanding used to determine earnings per diluted share were 45,401,778 for the third quarter of 2005 and 46,299,925 for the third quarter of 2004.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, revenues increased to $442.9 million, up 17.4% from $377.3 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit was $193.8, up 15.6% from $167.7 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 43.8% versus 44.4% in the same period in 2004. Earnings per diluted share increased 17.2% to $1.50 from $1.28 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.
In September 2005, 3CI Complete Compliance Corporation, of which we are the majority shareholder, recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.5 million (after-tax) on its Springhill, Louisiana building and property. Without this charge, our earnings per diluted share for the third quarter would have been $0.53 and our earnings per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 would have been $1.51.
Our total debt to capitalization percentage ratio at September 30, 2005 was 31.7% versus 29.1% at December 31, 2004.
Stericycle's President and CEO, Mark Miller said, "During the quarter, we continued to execute our proven business model, generating strong sales growth, and record income from operations. With a strong balance sheet, the cash flow from operations of $91.2 million for the first nine months of the year was used to strengthen our business and fund $47.3 million in stock repurchases."

Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
