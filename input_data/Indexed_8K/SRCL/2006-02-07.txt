Item 9.01 Financial Statement and Exhibits
On February 7, 2006 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES-Stericycle's management believes that non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. Stericycle believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Stericycle's performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to historical performance. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to GAAP results. The non-GAAP information excludes items such as special charges, which may have a material effect on our net income and net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations. We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations. The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
February 7, 2006

Lake Forest, Illinois, February 7, 2006
Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $166.6 million, up 19.9% from $138.9 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $16.9 million in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $74.2 million, up 22.6% from $60.5 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.6% versus 43.6% in the fourth quarter of 2004.
After the effect of the charges for the preliminary settlement and related legal expenses of the 3CI class action litigation that we announced in November 2005, write-down of a note receivable with our former South African joint venture, and loan refinancing expenses, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $0.1 million or $0.00 per diluted share compared with GAAP net income of $19.1 million or $0.42 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $25.2 million or $0.56 per diluted share compared with non-GAAP net income of $21.7 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.
Non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2005 excludes the charges for the preliminary settlement and related legal expenses of the 3CI class action litigation that we announced in November 2005, write-down of a note receivable with our former South African joint venture, and loan refinancing expenses (please see table below). Non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2004 excludes the write-off of loan refinancing expenses.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
For the full year ended December 31, 2005, revenues increased to $609.5 million, up 18.1% from $516.2 million in 2004. Gross profit was $268.0 million, up 17.5% from $228.2 million in 2004. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.0% versus 44.2% last year.
GAAP net income for the year was $68.3 million or $1.51 per diluted share compared with GAAP net income of $78.2 million or $1.69 per diluted share in 2004
Non-GAAP net income for the year was $94.0 million, or $2.07 per diluted share compared to $81.6 million, or $1.77 per diluted share for 2004. Non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for 2005 exclude the same items excluded for the fourth quarter of 2005 (described above) and non-cash impairment of property, plant and equipment in 2005 and 2004, respectively (please see table below).
During the quarter, we increased our revolving credit facility from $400.0 million to $550.0 million. Our total debt to capitalization percentage ratio at December 31, 2005 was 40.8% versus 29.1% at December 31, 2004.
Cash flow from operations was $94.3 million for 2005, after deducting $23.4 million (net of tax) for the preliminary settlement of the 3CI class action litigation. Cash flow and increased loan balances were used to strengthen our business and funded $139.7 million in acquisitions and international investments, $60.7 million in stock repurchases and $26.3 million in capital spending.

Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
