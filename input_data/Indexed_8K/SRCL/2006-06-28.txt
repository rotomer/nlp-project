ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS On June 28, 2006, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") announced that it had referred to the United Kingdom Competition Commission (the "Competition Commission") the acquisition by our subsidiary, Stericycle International, LLC, in February 2006 of all of the stock of The Sterile Technologies Group Limited, an Irish company providing medical waste management services in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the OFT's referral, the Competition Commission is to decide whether, as a result of this acquisition, there has been or is expected to be a substantial lessening of competition in one or more markets in the United Kingdom for healthcare risk waste treatment and disposal, and if so, what remedial or other action, if any, should be taken or recommended by the Competition Commission. According to the OFT, the Competition Commission is expected to report in December 2006. -2-
