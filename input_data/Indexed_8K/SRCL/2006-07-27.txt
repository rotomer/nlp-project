Item 9.01 Financial Statement and Exhibits
On July 27, 2006 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.
Dated: July 27, 2006

Exhibit 99.1

SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR TO DATE RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 were $198.4 million, up 33.0% from $149.1 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $32.6 million in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $87.6 million, up 34.1% from $65.3 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.1% versus 43.8% in the second quarter of 2005.
Net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $25.2 million or $0.56 per diluted share compared with net income of $23.0 million or $0.51 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. During the quarter we wrote off a $1.0 million investment ($0.6 million net of tax or $0.014 per share).
For the six months ended June 30, 2006, revenues increased to $377.7 million, up 30.4% from $289.7 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit was $166.3 million, up 31.8% from $126.2 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 44.0% versus 43.6% in in the same period in 2005. Earnings per diluted share increased 8.8% to $1.08 from $0.99 per diluted share in the same period a year ago.
Net income in the second quarter of 2006 included $1.6 million of stock compensation expense ($2.7 million pre-tax) or $0.04 per diluted share recorded as a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R on January 1, 2006. Net income for the first six months of 2006 included $3.2 million of stock compensation ($5.3 million pre-tax) or $0.07 per diluted share.
Debt increased in the first six months due to acquisitions resulting in our total debt to capitalization percentage ratio at June 30, 2006 increasing to 45.0% from 40.9% at December 31, 2005.
Cash flow from operations was $64.3 million for the first six months of 2006. Cash flow and increased loan balances were used to strenghten our business and funded $126.1 million in acquisitions and international investments, $13.9 million in stock repurchases and $15.7 million in capital spending.

Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors identified in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
