Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Please refer to Item 2.03 of this report.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On July 31, 2006, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swingline lender, lender and letter of credit issuer, other lenders party to the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and Citibank, N.A., Fortis Capital Corp. and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as co-documentation agents, with Banc of America Securities LLC as sole lead arranger and sole book manager.
The new credit agreement is in effect an amendment of our prior senior unsecured credit facility. The new credit agreement (i) reduces our costs of borrowing by using a more favorable pricing grid; (ii) increases our revolving credit facility from $550 million to $650 million; (iii) increases the "accordion" (the amount for which we may request an increase in the size of our revolving credit facility) from $100 million to $200 million; (iv) increases the letter of credit sublimit from $150 million to $200 million; (v) increases the foreign currency sublimit from $125 million to $200 million; (vi) increases the debt-to-EBITDA covenant from 3.00:1.00 to 3.75:1.00; and (vii) extends the maturity date of our borrowings from June 30, 2010 to July 31, 2011.
The new credit agreement reduces our costs of borrowing by reducing the applicable margin that is added to the relevant interest rate that we are charged. Our borrowings bear interest at fluctuating interest rates determined, at our election in advance for any quarterly or other applicable interest period, by reference to (i) a "base rate" (the higher of the prime rate at Bank of America, N.A. or 0.5% above the rate on overnight federal funds transactions) or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus, in either case, the applicable margin within the relevant range of margins provided in our credit agreement. Under the new credit agreement, the applicable margin is based on (i) our consolidated leverage ratio, or, if our long-term non-credit enhanced debt has been rated by Standard & Poors, (ii) our S&P debt rating, whichever margin is more favorable to us. As of July 31, 2006, the margin for interest rates on borrowings under our new credit facility was 0.0% on base rate loans and 0.875% on LIBOR loans.
The new credit agreement contains customary events of default, including our failure to pay any principal, interest or other amount when due, our violation of certain of our affirmative covenants or any of our negative covenants, a breach of our representations and warranties, or a change of control. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of our indebtedness may be accelerated and the lending commitments under the credit agreement may be terminated.
A copy of the new credit agreement is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1.

If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender with respect to that Borrower shall deliver to Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Company, as the Administrative Agent or the Company shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any
 
Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.
