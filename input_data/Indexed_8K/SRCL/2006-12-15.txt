Item 8.01 Other Events
     On December 12, 2006, the United Kingdom Competition Commission published its final report on the acquisition by our subsidiary, Stericycle International, LLC, in February 2006 of all of the stock of The Sterile Technologies Group Limited ("STG"), an Irish company providing medical waste management services in Ireland and the United Kingdom.
     In its final report, the Competition Commission confirmed its provisional findings in October 2006 and concluded that the STG acquisition has resulted, and may be expected to continue to result, in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for healthcare risk waste services requiring incineration in five geographical areas of England and Wales (northern England, the north Midlands, north Wales, the West Midlands and southeast Wales).
     The Competition Commission accepted as a remedy our proposal to be allowed an initial period in which to sell three STG incinerators serving the affected geographical areas together with the associated customer contracts, subject to the Competition Commission's approval of the terms of sale and suitability of the purchaser. If we are unable to do so within this initial period, the Competition Commission will have the right to appoint a divestiture trustee and mandate the sale of all or part of STG's business in the United Kingdom (other than in Northern Ireland).
     The Competition Commission's final report is available on the Commission's website, .

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
     Date: December 15, 2006.
