Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 7, 2007 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 were $208.7 million, up 25.3% from $166.6 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $28.5 million in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $93.0 million, up 25.3% from $74.2 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2005.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $29.0 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $1.0 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, revenues increased to $789.6 million, up 29.6% from $609.5 million in 2005. Gross profit was $349.9 million, up 30.5% from $268.0 million in the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.3% versus 44.0% in 2005. Earnings per diluted share were $2.33 versus $1.48 per diluted share in 2005.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, acquisition integration related expenses were $1.0 million, net of tax, primarily related to facility closure costs. Both the quarterly and annual results from 2005 include the effect of the charges for the settlement and related legal expenses of the 3CI class action litigation, the write-down of a note receivable with our former South African joint venture, a licensing legal settlement and loan refinancing expenses, which together reduced net income by $26.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2006 we were reimbursed for $0.6 million, net of tax, of legal expenses related to the 3CI class action litigation.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 included $0.04 and $0.14 per share, respectively, recorded as a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R on January 1, 2006.
Cash flow from operations was $160.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cash flow and increased loan balances were used to strengthen our business and funded $164.0 million in acquisitions and international investments, $42.8 million in stock repurchases and $36.4 million in capital spending.

Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
