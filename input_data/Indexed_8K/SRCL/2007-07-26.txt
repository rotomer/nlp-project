Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 26, 2007 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to Stericycle's total debt to capitalizaton percentage ratio. The total debt to capitalization percentage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt (numerator) by the sum of total debt, preferred stock, and shareholders' equity (denominator). We consider this leverage ratio to be a good indicator of the strength of a company's balance sheet and its ability to service its debt. Total debt to capitalization percentage is not a measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 were $232.8 million, up 17.3% from $198.4 million in the second quarter of 2006.  Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed $11.0 million to the $34.4 million revenue growth in the second quarter of 2007. Gross profit was $104.5 million, up 19.4% from $87.6 million in the second quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.9% versus 44.1% in the second quarter of 2006.

During the quarter we completed a 2-for-1 stock split.  All historical per share numbers have been adjusted for the split.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, revenues increased to $443.9 million, up 17.5% from $377.7 million in the same period a year ago.
