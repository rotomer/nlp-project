Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 6, 2008 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release and accompanying balance sheet refer to "non-GAAP" measures.  These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The non-GAAP information excludes items such as special charges, which may have a material effect on our net income and net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations. We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations.

, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2007.
Lake Forest, Illinois, February 6, 2008Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 were $251.6 million, up 20.5% from $208.7 million in the same quarter last year.  Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $17.9 million to the growth in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $112.4 million, up 20.8% from $93.0 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.7% versus 44.6% in the fourth quarter of 2006.
After the effect of the charges described in the reconciliation table below, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $24.1 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with GAAP net income of $29.0 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.   The impact of the charges described in the reconciliation table was to reduce net income by $9.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share.  The adjusted non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $33.9 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared with non-GAAP net income of $28.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2006.
During the second quarter of 2007 we completed a 2-for-1 stock split.  All historical per share numbers have been adjusted for the split.
  
(UNAUDITED)
      
 
(1)
The other charges listed above in the fourth quarter of 2007 consist of  the following items detailed on the attached Consolidated Statements of Income; (i)  we divested the over the counter products portion of our Scherer Labs assets which resulted in a gain; (ii)  we wrote down the White Rose Environmental trade name as a result of the name change of our subsidiary in the United Kingdom; and (iii)  we wrote down our investment in Medam, B.A., an Argentina joint venture.  The write down of our investment in Argentina was a result of the legal restructuring of the business operations.  The above items were partially offset by the receipt of proceeds from one of our insurance carriers for coverage related to the 3CI class action litigation settlement.
(2)
The other charges listed above for the entire year of 2007 consist of the items discussed in (1) above and the following additional items: (i) we recorded a gain on the divestiture of selected assets of Sterile Technologies, Ltd., one of our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom; (ii) we wrote down the permit intangible for a treatment facility in the United Kingdom that was no longer being used; and (iii) we also wrote down equipment that had been permanently idled.  In addition, we received proceeds from another one of our insurance carriers for coverage related to the 3CI class action litigation settlement.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
For the full year ended December 31, 2007, revenues increased to $932.8 million, up 18.1% from $789.6 million in 2006.  Gross profit was $417.9 million, up 19.5% from $349.9 million in 2006.  Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.8% versus 44.3% last year.  
GAAP net income for the year was $118.4 million or $1.32 per diluted share compared with GAAP net income of $105.3 million or $1.16 per diluted share.
Non-GAAP net income for the year was $127.6 million, or $1.42 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net income for 2006 of $105.4 million or $1.16 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for 2007 and 2006 exclude the same items described in the table above.
Cash flow from operations was $174.0 million for 2007.  Cash flow and increased loan balances were used to strengthen our business and funded $114.8 million in acquisitions and international investments, $103.7 million in stock repurchases and $48.4 million in capital spending.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Stericycle's management believes that non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. Stericycle believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Stericycle's performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to historical performance. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in
addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The non-GAAP information excludes items such as special charges, which may have a material effect on our net income and net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations. We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations.

: Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include difficulties in completing the integration of acquired businesses, changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment, and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the various other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment t o disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
