Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 23, 2008 Stericycle, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference.
The press release refers to "non-GAAP" measures.  These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The non-GAAP information excludes items such as special charges, which may have a material effect on our net income and net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. We exclude these charges and the related tax benefit from the charges when analyzing our financial results as the items are distinguishable events and have no impact to our ongoing results of operations. We believe that by viewing our results of operations excluding these charges, investors are given an indication of the ongoing results of our operations.
Item 8.01
Other Events
On April 19, 2008 Stericycle and Daniels Corporation (UK) Limited ("Daniels UK"), a subsidiary of Daniels Sharpsmart Pty Limited ("Daniels"), and certain affiliated companies entered into a settlement of arbitration proceedings in the United Kingdom prior to any award by the arbitrator. These arbitration proceedings, which Daniels UK initiated in February 2007 under the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators' Arbitration Rules, related to claims that our United Kingdom subsidiary, White Rose Environmental Limited ("White Rose"), had breached obligations that it owed to a joint venture that it had formed with Daniels UK for the sale of Daniels reusable sharps containers. This joint venture, White Rose Sharpsmart Limited, was formed in October 2001 prior to our acquisition of White Rose in June 2004.
At the same time as the settlement of the arbitration proceedings, we entered into settlements with other subsidiaries of Daniels resolving various disputes and received a full release of all claims. In addition, we finalized the payment of the legal fees that SteriCorp Limited had been awarded under the arbitrator's award that we have previously reported.
Under these settlements, we incurred a total pre-tax expense of $5.4 million, or an after-tax expense of $3.3 million, in the first quarter of 2008.

, today reported financial results for the first quarter 2008.
Lake Forest, Illinois, April 23, 2008Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 were $254.8, up 20.7% from $211.0 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $19.5 million to the growth in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $113.6 million, up 20.5% from $94.2 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.6% versus 44.7% in the first quarter of 2007.
After the effect of the charge described in the table below, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $31.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared with GAAP net income of $29.4 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.  The impact of the charge described was to reduce net income by $3.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share.  Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2008(GAAP net income without including the charge described) was $35.0 million or $0.39 per diluted share.
Cash flow from operations was $63.6 million for the first three months of 2008. Cash flow and increased loan balances were used to strengthen our business and funded $79.4 million in stock repurchases (1,482,185 shares), $11.3 million in capital spending, and $7.8 million in acquisitions and international investments.

During the second quarter of 2007 we completed a 2-for-1 stock split. All historical per share numbers have been adjusted for the split.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Stericycle's management believes that non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for
greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.

: Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.
