Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 were $274.0 million, up 8.9% from $251.6 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $14.2 million to the growth in revenues for the quarter. Gross profit was $125.3 million, up 11.5% from $112.4 million in the same quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenue was 45.7% versus 44.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $39.1 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with net income of $24.1 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 included the effect of $9.8 million of charges or $0.11 per diluted share related to an arbitration settlement, trade name write-down and foreign investment write-down.  These charges were partially offset by receipt of insurance proceeds and a gain on sale of assets.

For the full year ended December 31, 2008, revenues were $1.1 billion, up 16.2% from $932.8 million in the same period last year.  Gross profit was $485.0 million, up 16.1% from $417.9 million in the same period last year.  Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 44.8% in both 2008 and 2007.  Earnings per diluted share for 2008 increased 27.9% to $1.68 from $1.32 per diluted share for 2007.  Earnings per diluted share for 2008 were negatively impacted by $0.05 per diluted share related to the arbitration settlement recorded in the first quarter of 2008 and impairment of fixed assets.   Earnings per diluted share for 2007 were negatively impacted by $9.3 million of charges or $0.10 per diluted share for the impairment of permit, fixed assets write-offs and the charges described in the quarterly results paragraph above, partially offset by the receipt of insurance proceed and gains from sale of assets.
Cash flow from operations was $210.6 million for the full year of 2008. Cash flow and increased loan balances were used to strengthen our business through acquisitions, international investments, capital expenditures and funding share repurchases.

Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends.
