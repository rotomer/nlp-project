Net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $40.7 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared with net income of $31.7 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008.  Net income for the first quarter of 2008 included the effect of $3.3 million of charges related to an arbitration settlement and net income for the first quarter of 2009 included the effect of $0.4 million of charges related to the adoption of FAS 141R expensing of acquisition transaction related expenses.

: Statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control (for example, general economic conditions). Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of medical waste collection and treatment and increases in transportation and other operating costs, as well as the other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends.
