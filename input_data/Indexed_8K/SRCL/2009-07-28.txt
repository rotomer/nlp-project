Item 2.03
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On July 23, 2009, we entered into a first amendment and increase agreement (the "first amendment") with respect to the three-year term loan credit agreement dated as of June 24, 2009 that we entered into withBank of America, N.A.,as administrative agent and a lender, other lenders from time to time party to the credit agreement, and a syndication agent to be determined. We reported entering into the term loan credit agreement and obtaining an initial term loan of $50,000,000 by our current report on Form 8-K that we filed on June 26, 2009.
The first amendment amends the term loan credit agreement to reflect additional lenders becoming party to the agreement. It also increases the aggregate amount for which we may request additional term loans prior to December 25, 2009 from $150,000,000 to $175,000,000.
We obtained an additional term loan of $145,000,000 concurrently with entering into the first amendment. This additional term loan increased our aggregate borrowings under the term loan credit agreement from $50,000,000 to $195,000,000 and reduced the aggregate amount for which we may request additional term loans from $175,000,000 to $30,000,000.
In addition, the lead arranger and book manager under the term loan credit agreement has received signed commitments from three new lenders to become party to the term loan credit agreement and fund an additional term loan of $20,000,000. We anticipate (but can provide no assurance) that these new lenders will become party to the term loan credit agreement on or about July 30, 2009 and that we will obtain an additional term loan of $20,000,000 at the same time. If we do obtain such an additional term loan, our aggregate borrowings under the term loan credit agreement would increase from $195,000,000 to $215,000,000 and the aggregate amount for which we may request additional term loans prior to December 25, 2009 would be reduced from $30,000,000 to $10,000,000.
A copy of the first amendment is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1.
