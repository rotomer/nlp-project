Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
As we previously reported, on December 7, 2009, we completed our acquisition of MedServe, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("MedServe"), pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of May 9, 2009, as amended, that we and our acquisition subsidiary entered into with MedServe and Avista Capital Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as the representative of the MedServe shareholders. Pursuant to the merger agreement and upon completion of the merger, our acquisition subsidiary was merged with and into MedServe and MedServe became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. Completion of the merger followed the receipt on November 30, 2009 of clearance of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
The total merger consideration was $182,500,000 in cash, subject to reduction for MedServe's indebtedness as of the closing date, MedServe's expenses in connection with the transaction, and other expenses related to the transaction. In addition, $27,375,000 of the merger consideration was deposited into escrow to cover indemnification obligations of the MedServe stockholders under the merger agreement.
There was no material relationship between us or any of our affiliates and any stockholders of MedServe.
