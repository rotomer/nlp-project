STERICYCLE, INC. REPORTS RESULTS
FOR FOURTH QUARTER and FULL YEAR 2009
, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2009.
Lake Forest, Illinois, February 4, 2010Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 were $313.5 million, up 14.4% from $274.0 million in the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $25.9 million to the growth in revenues for the quarter. Revenues increased 13.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 when adjusted for favorable foreign exchange impacts of $2.6 million. Gross profit was $147.1 million, up 17.5% from $125.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenue was 46.9% compared with 45.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2009 was unfavorably impacted by $0.7 million of restructuring costs for our regulated returns management services business.
Net income attributable to Stericycle for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $44.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared with net income of $39.1 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Net income attributable to Stericycle for the fourth quarter of 2008 included the effect of $0.3 million of charges related to foreign investment write-down, and net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 included the effects of $1.8 million of after-tax transactional expenses related to acquisitions and $1.0 million of after-tax restructuring costs for our regulated returns management services business. Adjusted for these charges, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased from $0.45 in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2009 or up 22.0% (see table below).  
FULL YEAR RESULTS
For the full year ended December 31, 2009, revenues were $1.18 billion, up 8.7% from $1.08 billion in 2008.  Revenues increased 12.2% compared with prior year when adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of $38.1 million.  Gross profit was $552.4 million, up 13.9% from $485.0 million last year.  Gross profit as a percent of revenues was 46.9%, up from 44.8% in 2008.  Gross profit for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by $0.7 million of restructuring costs for our regulated returns management services business.  
Earnings per diluted share for 2009 increased to $2.03 from $1.68 per diluted share for 2008.  Earnings per diluted share for 2008 were unfavorably impacted by an arbitration settlement and an impairment of fixed assets. Earnings per diluted share for 2009 were unfavorably impacted by transactional expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs for our regulated returns management services business, which were offset partially by the net release of prior years' tax reserves.  Adjusted for these charges, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased from $1.73 in 2008 to $2.09 in 2009, or 21.3% (see table below):
* In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reported earnings per share include the after-tax impact of the items identified in the table.  The Company's management believes that by adjusting reported earnings per share to exclude the effect of these non-operational items, the resulting earnings per share presents a more meaningful, operationally-oriented depiction of company performance. The Company's management excludes these items from its results when evaluating operating performance and, along with other factors, in determining management compensation.
Cash flow from operations was $277.2 million for the full year of 2009. Cash flow and increased loan balances were used to strengthen our business by acquisitions, capital expenditures and share repurchases.
