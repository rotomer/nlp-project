Item 2.03
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On August 18, 2010, we entered into a note purchase agreement (the "note purchase agreement") with 39 institutional purchasers pursuant to which we will issue and sell to the purchasers $175,000,000 of our new 3.89% seven-year unsecured senior notes (the "Series A notes") and $225,000,000 of our new 10-year 4.47% unsecured senior notes (the "Series B notes," and together with the Series A notes, the "notes").
Closing of the issuance and sale of the notes is subject to the terms and conditions of the note purchase agreement and is anticipated to occur on or about October 15, 2010.
If and when issued, the Series A notes will bear interest at the fixed rate of 3.89% per annum, and the Series B notes will bear interest at the fixed rate of 4.47% per annum. Interest will be payable in arrears semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 beginning on April 15, 2011. The principal of the Series A notes will be payable at the maturity of the notes on October 15, 2017, and the principal of the Series B notes will be payable at the maturity of the notes on October 15, 2020. The notes will be unsecured obligations.
We will apply the proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
The notes will contain customary events of default, including our failure to pay any principal, interest or other amount when due, our violation of our affirmative or negative covenants, or a breach of our representations and warranties. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of the notes may be accelerated by the holders of the notes.
A copy of the note purchase agreement (which includes the form of the Series A notes as Exhibit 1(a) and the form of the Series B notes as Exhibit 1(b)) is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1.
