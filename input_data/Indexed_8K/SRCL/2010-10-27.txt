Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 were $363.0 million, up 21.9% from $297.8 million from the same quarter last year. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $29.2 million to the growth in revenues.  Impact from unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter was $1.6 million.  Gross profit was $168.1 million, up 19.3% from $140.9 million in the third quarter last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenue was 46.3% compared with 47.3% in the third quarter of 2009.  
Net income attributable to Stericycle for the third quarter of 2010 was $56.7 million or $0.65 per diluted share compared with $46.5 million or $0.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2009, up 21.8%.  GAAP net income attributable to Stericycle for the third quarter of 2010 reflected various non-operational items which, taken together, resulted in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.65 (see table below). This was a 17.0% increase from our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 in the third quarter of 2009.  
FIRST NINE MONTHS' RESULTS
For the nine months ending September 30, 2010, revenues were $1.05 billion, up 21.0% from $864.2 million in the same period last year. Impact from favorable foreign exchange compared with the same period last year was $3.5 million.  Gross profit was $485.0 million, up 19.7% from $405.3 million in the same period last year. Gross profit as a percent of revenue was 46.4% compared with 46.9% in 2009. GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 20.5% to $1.82 from $1.51 per diluted share in the same period last year.  Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, when adjusted for various non-operational items, increased from $1.54 to $1.83, or 18.7% (see table below):
* In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reported earnings per share include the after-tax impact of the items identified in this table. For internal purposes, including the determination of management compensation, the Company excludes these items from results when evaluating operating performance. This table and the Company's internal use of non-GAAP earnings per share are not intended to imply, and should not be interpreted as implying, that non-GAAP earnings per share is a better measure of performance than GAAP earnings per share.
Cash flow from operations was $205.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.
