Lake Forest, Illinois, July 27, 2011Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL)
Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 were $410.4 million, up 18.0% from $347.7 million from the same quarter last year.  Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed approximately $34.9 million to the growth in revenues.  The impact on revenues from foreign exchange in the quarter was $7.4 million favorable.  Gross profit was $186.7 million, up 15.6% from $161.5 million in the second quarter last year.  Gross profit as a percent of revenue was 45.5% compared with 46.5% in the second quarter of 2010.
Net income attributable to Stericycle for the second quarter of 2011 was $55.5 million or $0.63 per diluted share compared with $53.1 million or $0.61 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010.  Net income attributable to Stericycle for the second quarter of 2011 reflected various non-operational items, which taken together, resulted in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.69 (see table below).  Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 11.9% from our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 in the second quarter of 2010.  
FIRST SIX MONTHS' RESULTS
For the six months ending June 30, 2011, revenues were $808.6 million, up 18.4% from $682.9 million in the same period last year. Revenues increased 17.0% compared with the prior period when adjusted for favorable foreign exchange impacts of $9.7 million.  Gross profit was $369.2 million, up 16.5% from $316.9 million in the same period last year.  Gross profit as a percent of revenue was 45.7% compared with 46.4% in 2010.  Earnings per diluted share increased to $1.27 from $1.17 per diluted share in the same period last year.  Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, when adjusted for various non-operational items, increased from $1.18 to $1.37, or 15.7% (see table below):
* In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reported earnings per share include the after-tax impact of the items identified in this table. For internal purposes, including the determination of management compensation, the Company excludes these items from results when evaluating operating performance. This table and the Company's internal use of non-GAAP earnings per share are not intended to imply, and should not be interpreted as implying, that non-GAAP earnings per share is a better measure of performance than GAAP earnings per share.
Cash flow from operations was $119.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011.
