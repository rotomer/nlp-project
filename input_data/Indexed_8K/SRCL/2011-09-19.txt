Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
We previously reported the voting results at our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 24, 2011 in a current report on Form 8-K that we filed on May 26, 2011. This report disclosed that our stockholders cast 43,833,059 votes in favor of an annual say-on-pay vote (i.e.,  an annual vote on a non-binding advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in our proxy statement), as opposed to 928,980 votes cast in favor of a say-on-pay vote every two years and 24,201,076 votes cast in favor of a say-on-pay vote every three years (and 37,501 votes abstaining).
At a meeting on August 18, 2011, our Board of Directors decided, after considering the stockholder vote, to include a say-on-pay vote annually in our proxy materials until the next stockholder vote on the frequency of the say-on-pay vote. The Board has tentatively determined that the next stockholder vote on the frequency of the say-on-pay vote will be held at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: September 19, 2011.
