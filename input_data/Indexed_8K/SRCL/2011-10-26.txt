* In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reported earnings per share include the after-tax impact of the items identified in this table. For internal purposes, including the determination of management compensation, the Company excludes these items from results when evaluating operating performance. This table and the Company's internal use of non-GAAP earnings per share are not intended to imply, and should not be interpreted as implying, that non-GAAP earnings per share is a better measure of performance than GAAP earnings per share.
Cash flow from operations was $215.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
