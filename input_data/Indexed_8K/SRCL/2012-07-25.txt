For internal purposes, including the determination of management compensation, the Company excludes these items from results when evaluating operating performance. This table and the Company's internal use of non-GAAP earnings per share are not intended to imply, and should not be interpreted as implying, that non-GAAP earnings per share is a better measure of performance than GAAP earnings per share.
Cash flow from operations was $188.8 million and $119.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
