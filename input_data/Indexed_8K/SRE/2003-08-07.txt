Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
 
 
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 7, 2003 -- Sempra Energy today reported unaudited second-quarter 2003 earnings of $116 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with $147 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the same period of 2002.
Second-quarter 2002 earnings included a $25 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, after-tax benefit at San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) from the favorable resolution of tax issues from prior years and an extraordinary gain of $2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to Sempra Energy Trading's acquisition of the metals business.
Year-to-date, Sempra Energy reported earnings of $204 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in 2003, compared with $293 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, during the first six months of 2002.
Year-to-date 2003 results reflect the $45 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, negative effects of implementing new accounting principle EITF 02-3. The components of this non-cash reduction in earnings consist of $29 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, reflected as a cumulative-effect adjustment at Dec. 31, 2002, and an additional $16 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the year-to-date effect of the change. EITF 02-3 eliminated mark-to-market accounting for certain commodity-trading assets, changing the timing for revenue recognition.
Revenues for Sempra Energy rose 20 percent to $1.8 billion in the second quarter 2003 from $1.5 billionin the second quarter 2002. Increased revenues during the second quarter this year resulted from higher commodity prices, primarily at Sempra Energy Utilities, and from SDG&E's resuming the purchase of a portion of its power requirements in 2003.
Earnings Outlook
The company expects reported 2003 earnings-per-share to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.90.
"Our businesses remain on track to meet our operating expectations for the year," said Stephen L. Baum, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy. "Our new guidance is on a reported per-share basis. It reflects an anticipated favorable resolution of tax issues that are expected to more than offset the cumulative effect of mandated accounting changes."
Baum said the new earnings guidance reflects the effect of several non-cash items, including the previously identified cumulative effect of $0.14 per diluted share related to EITF 02-3. In addition, in the third quarter 2003, the company will adopt FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), requiring the consolidation of its variable interest entities. The adoption of FIN 46 is expected to result in a non-cash cumulative downward adjustment to earnings of approximately $0.14 per diluted share. The anticipated favorable resolution of tax issues relates primarily to utility balancing accounts.
Sempra Energy Utilities
Sempra Energy Utilities contributed net income of $78 million in the second quarter 2003, compared with net income of $102 million in the second quarter last year. Second-quarter 2002 earnings included the $25 million tax benefit at SDG&E.
Net income at both SDG&E and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) were negatively impacted by the end of merger savings allocated to shareholders. From 1998, when Sempra Energy was formed, through 2002, both utilities benefited from sharing in savings from the merger.
SDG&E reported net income in the second quarter 2003 of $41 million, down from $51 million for the same period in 2002. Absent the $25 million tax benefit, SDG&E's net income improved primarily due to increased revenues from electric distribution and transmission operations.
Net income for SoCalGas decreased in the second quarter 2003 to $37 million from $51 million in the same period in 2002, due to the loss of sharing merger savings and higher operating expenses.
Sempra Energy Trading
Sempra Energy Trading reported net income of $35 million for the second quarter 2003, up 67 percent from $21 million in the year-earlier period, as trading volumes and margins improved, with significant gains in natural gas and oil trading
.
Excluding the EITF 02-3 quarterly impact of $7 million, Sempra Energy Trading's second-quarter 2003 earnings would have been $42 million.
"The fundamentals of our trading operation remain solid," said Baum. "During the second quarter, the volume of our customer transactions grew, demonstrating the strength of this business in both volatile and stable commodity markets. We focus on a short-dated portfolio of customer contracts that convert into cash relatively quickly -- the majority in less than one year. "
Sempra Energy Resources
Sempra Energy Resources, the wholesale power-generation subsidiary of Sempra Energy, reported net income of $5 million in the second quarter 2003, compared with $34 million in the second quarter 2002. Lower 2003 second-quarter earnings were primarily related to the requirements of its contract with the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR).
"Under our contract with the CDWR, a substantial portion of the power deliveries are scheduled for the second half of the year, so we are on track at Sempra Energy Resources to reach our 2003 target of $55 million to $65 million," Baum said.
Sempra Energy Resources has brought online three new, state-of-the-art power plants operating in Arizona, California and Mexico, representing a combined total of about 1,500 megawatts, producing power to help meet the energy needs of the Pacific Southwest. An additional generating unit of 625 megawatts at the Arizona power plant is scheduled to be operational by December 2003.
Sempra Energy Resources received two favorable regulatory and court rulings, one by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission June 25, 2003, and another by the California Superior Court May 20, 2003, upholding the company's 10-year contract with the CDWR.
In another positive ruling for the company, a U.S. District Court decision July 9, 2003, allowed for the continued import of power into the United States from Sempra Energy Resources' Termoelectrica de Mexicali 600-megawatt natural gas-fueled power plant in Mexico. The plant is designed to be one of the cleanest in North America.
Baum said the company expects to prevail in any appeals of these matters.
Sempra Energy International
For the second quarter of 2003, Sempra Energy International's net income rose to $18 million from $9 million during the same quarter in 2002, primarily due to the successful resolution of a dispute related to the company's South American operations.
The company continues development of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminals in Baja California, Mexico, and Louisiana. The Baja California facility, Energia Costa Azul, has received its environmental permit from Mexican regulators and two other key permits -- one for operations and, the other, for local land use -- are expected to be granted in the third quarter 2003. The Louisiana terminal, Cameron LNG, also is in the permitting phase and is expected to receive final regulatory approvals by the end of the year. Energia Costa Azul and Cameron LNG are scheduled to be operational by 2006 and 2007, respectively.
Sempra Energy Solutions
Sempra Energy Solutions, which offers energy outsourcing and commodity services to commercial and industrial customers, recorded net income of $8 million in the second quarter 2003, compared with net income of $5 million in the same period in 2002.
