Item 5. Other Events.
 
On October 8, 2003, Sempra Energy executed an underwriting agreement for the issuance and sale of 15,000,000 shares of its common stock (with the option to issue and sell up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of its common stock), as set forth in the Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement with respect thereto, dated October 8, 2003. The transaction is expected to close on or about October 14, 2003. Further information regarding the transaction is contained in the underwriting agreement and pricing agreement, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1 and 1.2.
 
In the Prospectus Supplement filed with respect to the offering of common stock, Sempra Energy reported the following recent developments:
 
Credit Rating Changes
 
On October 7, 2003, Standard & Poor's reduced our corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings from A- to BBB+. It also reduced the corporate credit ratings of our California utility subsidiaries, San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), from A+ to A, their senior unsecured debt ratings from A to A-, and their preferred stock ratings from A- to BBB+. The utilities' prior ratings for their senior secured debt were affirmed at A+. All ratings were issued with a stable outlook.
 
Litigation
 
As previously reported, on August 25, 2003 the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) announced that it had denied a rehearing of its decision approving a settlement with SDG&E allocating between customers and shareholders the profits from intermediate-term purchase power contracts that SDG&E had entered into prior to California's electric utility industry restructuring. Utility Consumers' Action Network, an advocacy group for small consumers, has petitioned the California Court of Appeals to review the CPUC's decision. The acceptance of the petition for review is at the discretion of the court. As a result of the CPUC decision, we have recognized additional after-tax income of $65 million in the third quarter of 2003.
 
On September 30, 2003, an arbitration panel determined that our subsidiary, Sempra Energy Resources, had not breached its joint development contract with a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Company relating to the Elk Hills power project jointly developed by the two companies. Occidental had alleged, among other things, that it was entitled to become a party to our subsidiary's electricity supply contract with the California Department of Water Resources or receive a share of the proceeds from providing power under the contract from the Elk Hills project.
 
Other
 
As a result of reductions in actual and previously anticipated sales of natural gas by Frontier Energy, our small North Carolina utility subsidiary, we have written down our carrying value of the assets of the utility by approximately $80 million. The write down reduces our after-tax income for the third quarter of 2003 by approximately $50 million.
 
Our third quarter net income will also be negatively affected by a $37 million after-tax charge for litigation and for losses associated with a sublease of portions of the SoCalGas headquarters building.
 
As previously reported, our California utility subsidiaries have filed cost of service applications with the CPUC seeking rate increases designed to reflect forecasts of 2004 capital and operating costs. The utilities are requesting revenue increases of approximately $121 million ($45 million for SoCalGas and $76 million for SDG&E). The CPUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates is advocating rate decreases that would reduce the utilities' annual revenues by $162 million from their current level ($121 million for SoCalGas and $41 million for SDG&E). Two advocacy groups for small consumers are advocating rate decreases that would reduce annual revenues by $266 million from their current level ($178 million
for SoCalGas and $88 million for SDG&E). The procedural schedule for the cost of service applications permits a decision as early as March 2004, and our utilities have filed a petition for interim rate relief for the period from January 1, 2004 until the effective date of the decision.
 
On October 7, 2003, SDG&E applied to the CPUC for approval of an electric procurement plan that contemplates (i) procuring 643 megawatts of energy and demand reduction resources beginning in 2005 with contracts extending through 2020, (ii) acquiring 601 megawatts of new generation, including a 555-megawatt power plant in Escondido, California to be constructed by Sempra Energy Resources, another of our subsidiaries, for completion in 2006, and (iii) constructing new transmission lines. The cost related to this proposed plan is approximately $640 million.

EXHIBIT 1.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To the Representatives of the  
several Underwriters named in  
the respective Pricing Agreements  
hereinafter described
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
From time to time, Sempra Energy, a California corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) its common stock, no par value (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Firm Designated Securities.") If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of Securities, for the sole purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, in the sale of the Firm Designated Securities, as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Designated Securities"). The Firm Designated Securities and any Optional Designated Securities are collectively called the "Designated Securities."
 
1.    Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of such Firm Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the number of such Firm Designated Securities to be purchased by each
Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect to the Designated Securities, and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm Designated Securities and the payment therefor. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
 
2.    The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
 
(a)    Registration statements on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-52192, 333-70640 and 333-103588) (such registration statements, as amended, collectively, the "Initial Registration Statement") in respect of the Securities and certain other securities have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); the Initial Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives and, excluding exhibits to the Initial Registration Statement, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained therein, to the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement, if any, increasing the size of the offering (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), which, if so filed, became effective upon filing, no other document with respect to the Initial Registration Statement or any document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than documents filed after the filing date of the Initial Registration Statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, each in the form heretofore delivered to the Representatives); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Initial Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in the Initial Registration Statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Act, is hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus"; the various parts of the Initial Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in the Initial Registration Statement at the time such part of the Initial Registration Statement became effective but excluding any Form T-1, each as amended at the time such part of the Initial Registration Statement became effective or such part of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, became or hereafter becomes effective, are hereinafter collectively called the "Registration Statement"; the prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement, being hereinafter called the "Prospectus"; any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or

Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Firm Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of such Firm Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer such Firm Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
 
The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "Over-allotment Option") to purchase at their election up to the number of Optional Designated Securities set forth in such Pricing Agreement, on the terms set forth therein, for the sole purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, in the sale of the Firm Designated Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Designated Securities may be exercised, subject to Section 4 below, in whole
 
or in part from time to time by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Designated Securities to be purchased and the date or dates on which such Optional Designated Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives, and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement.
 
The number of Optional Designated Securities to be added to the number of Firm Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the number of Optional Designated Securities which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been allocated to such Underwriter; provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the number of Optional Designated Securities to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Designated Securities which the number of Firm Designated Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 100 securities). The total number of Designated Securities to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate number of Optional Designated Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
 
4.    Firm Designated Securities and Optional Designated Securities, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in such amounts as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered through the facilities of DTC by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives at least forty-eight hours in advance or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "First Time of Delivery" for such Securities. The Optional Designated Securities, if any, shall be delivered through the facilities of DTC by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives in the manner and at the place and time or times and date or dates specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Designated Securities, or at such other places and times and dates as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such times, dates and places, if not the First Time of Delivery, being herein called a "Subsequent Time of Delivery." Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery."
 
5.    The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities:
 
(a)    To prepare the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing

It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 8 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
 
7.    The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
 
(a)    The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of the applicable Pricing Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction;
 
(b)    Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to the Representatives such written opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as well as such other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
 
(c)    Gary W. Kyle, Chief Corporate Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives a written opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery for
 
such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
 
(i)    The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of California, with the corporate and legal power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not subject it to material liability or disability; and each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation;
 
(ii)    The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and, except for the outstanding preferred stock of SCGC and PE and the outstanding preferred and preference stock of SDG&E, are owned of record directly or indirectly by the Company and, to such counsel's knowledge, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
 
(iii)    To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would reasonably be expected individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
 
(iv)    This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
(v)    The Designated Securities to be issued and sold by the Company pursuant to this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and, when such Designated Securities are issued and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities, such Designated Securities will be validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable;
 
(vi)    The issue and sale of the Designated Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or
 
violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of their respective material properties or assets is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective material properties;
 
(vii)    No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective material properties is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters;
 
(viii)    Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is (i) in violation of its By-laws or Articles of Incorporation or (ii) in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, except in the case of clause (ii) for such defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
 
(ix)    There are no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase any shares of the Securities pursuant to the Company's Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or any agreement or other instrument to which the Company is a party, nor are there any restrictions upon the voting or transfer of any shares of the Securities pursuant to the Company's Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or any agreement or other instrument to which the Company is a party other than pursuant to the Company's employee benefits and compensation plans and related agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement;
 
(x)    The statements set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented under the caption "Description of Sempra Energy's Common Stock and Preferred Stock," insofar as it purports to constitute a summary of the terms of the Company's capital stock or the Securities, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting," insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate and fair in all material respects;
 
(xi)    The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Designated Securities, will not be, an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
 
(xii)    The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel expresses no belief with respect to the financial statements or schedules or other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
 
(xiii)    The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (in each case, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements for registration statements on Form S-3 under the Act, and the requirements under the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, it being understood, however, that such counsel expresses no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules or other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or with respect to any Form T-1. In passing upon the compliance as to the form of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (in each case, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein), except for those statements referred to in the opinion in subsection (x) of this Section 7(c), such counsel has assumed that the statements made and incorporated by reference therein are correct and complete; and
 
(xiv)    The Company has received an order from the Commission exempting the Company from all of the provisions of the 1935 Act, except for Section 9(a)(2) thereof.
 
(d)    Counsel for the Company satisfactory to the Representatives shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
 
(i)    The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (in each case, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements for registration statements on Form S-3 under the Act, and the requirements under the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that such counsel expresses no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules or other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or with respect to any Form T-1. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (in each case, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein), such counsel has assumed that the statements made and incorporated by reference therein are correct and complete.
 
In addition, such counsel shall provide a statement to the effect that such counsel has participated in telephone conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, and representatives of the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and has not made any independent check or verification thereof, during the course of such participation, no facts came to such counsel's attention that caused them to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference), as of its date and as of the date of such opinion, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel expresses no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
 
(e)    On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and a letter dated each such Time of Delivery reaffirming the statements made in their letter dated the date of the Pricing Agreement, except that the specified date referred to in such letter delivered on each such Time of Delivery shall be a date not more than three days prior to such Time of Delivery, and with respect to such letter dated each such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
 
(f)    (i) The Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole shall have not sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by
 
reference in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities or both on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities;
 
(g)    On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, other than a downgrade by Fitch Ratings to not lower than BBB+ and (ii) no such organization, other than Fitch Ratings, shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
 
(h)    On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York or California State authorities or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities or both on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities;
 
(i)    The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York business day next succeeding the date of any Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities;
 
(j)    The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and
 
(k)    The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. shall have approved the Securities for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance.
 
8.    (a)    The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Designated Securities.
 
(b)    Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other
 
expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)    Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)    If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative
 
fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
(e)    The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9.    (a)    If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the
 
Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
 
(b)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)    If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Designated Securities or the Over-allotment Option related to such Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
10.    The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
11.    If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities with respect to which such Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option, as the case may be, shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
 
12.    In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
13.    This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
14.    Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
15.    This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
16.    This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
 
deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us one for the Company and for each of the Representatives plus one for each counsel counterparts hereof.

(i)    They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
 
(ii)    In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules audited (and, if applicable, financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related rules and regulations; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, financial forecasts and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the representative or representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives") such term to include an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives and are attached to such letters;
 
(iii)    They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited statements of consolidated income, consolidated balance sheets and condensed statements of consolidated cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as indicated in their reports thereon copies of which are attached to such letters; and on the basis of specified procedures including inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in paragraph (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
 
(iv)    The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for five such fiscal years included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
 
(v)    They have compared the information in the Prospectus under selected captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Items 301, 302, 402 and 503(d), respectively, of Regulation S-K;
 
(vi)    On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
 
(A)    (i) the unaudited statements of consolidated income, consolidated balance sheets and condensed statements of consolidated cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations adopted by the Commission, or (ii) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited statements of consolidated income, consolidated balance sheets and condensed statements of consolidated cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
 
(B)    any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(C)    the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and referred to in clause (B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10- K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(D)    any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply
 
as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
 
(E)    as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated current assets or shareholders' equity or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
 
(F)    for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in clause (E) there were any decreases in consolidated revenues or income before interest and income taxes or the total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
 
(vii)    In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (vi) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
 
All references in this Annex II to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Pricing
 
Agreement for purposes of such letter and to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) in relation to the applicable Designated Securities for purposes of the letter delivered at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities.
